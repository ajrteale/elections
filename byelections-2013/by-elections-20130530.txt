There is one by-election taking place on Thursday 30th May, a Tory defence in Staffordshire.

FAZELEY, Lichfield district council, Staffordshire; caused by the resignation of former Conservative councillor Ian Lewin.  Twice Mayor of Fazeley, Lewin resigned after being arrested on suspicion of internet grooming.

There is a well-known factoid that Birmingham has more miles of canals than Venice.  One of the most important parts of the West Midlands canal network is the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal, completed in 1789 to link Birmingham with coal mines at Walsall and the Coventry Canal at Fazeley, a small village on Watling Street just south of Tamworth, from where canal freight could turn north along the Coventry Canal to reach the Trent and Mersey near Lichfield.  The canal was a success and led to a small amount of industry at Fazeley, although the village remained overshadowed by Tamworth and never developed into a large town.  Outside the Fazeley parish boundary to the south, but included within the ward, is Drayton Manor, once the home of the Conservative prime minister Robert Peel and now home to a zoo and theme park with an impressive collection of rollercoasters.

This area has been trending towards the Conservatives over the last decade or so, but they have so far failed to collect a full set of the ward's three council seats.  Labour topped the poll here in the 2003 election, winning two seats to one for the Conservatives (Lewin).  The Tories took over second place in the 2007 election and gained one of the Labour seats, and the 2011 election confirmed the 2 Conservative/1 Labour split even though Labour could only find one candidate for the three seats.

The by-election is a straight fight between two candidates neither of whom can be described as local.  Defending for the Conservatives is Doug Pullen, a company director from Stonnall, a village some miles south-west of Lichfield; this isn't the first time he's sought to represent an area a long way away from his home, as he was an unsuccessful candidate in the 2011 Birmingham city council election.  Even further away is the Labour candidate Dave Whatton, bass guitarist in a band called "The Imposters", who gives an address in the village of Alrewas and fought his home ward in the last two elections.
