The slow pace of local by-elections continues, with just two contests this week, both in English cities.  Labour have a seat to defend in Newcastle upon Tyne, while the Tories need to fight off a Labour challenge to their safest ward in Nottingham.

WALKERGATE, Newcastle upon Tyne city council; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Tania Armstrong after just over a year in office, for family reasons.

Newcastle's most easterly ward, Walkergate straddles the various roads and the Metro line which connect the city to the suburb of Wallsend, running from the recently-closed Walkergate Hospital at the western end to the Tyne at the eastern end.  A relatively working-class ward according to the census figures, the deprivation indices paint a finer picture, with the area around Shields Road being much less deprived than the rest of the ward.

This ward is a Lib Dem-Labour fight as so much of the rest of Newcastle is.  The Lib Dems won all three seats in the ward when it was redrawn on its current boundaries in 2004, and increased their majorities in the next three elections.  However, Labour have taken over the ward's seats one by one since 2010; the Lib Dem vote held up relatively well in 2011 with the Labour majority being cut to just over 100 votes, but the yellow vote collapsed in 2012.  There is no Conservative vote to speak of here; the party were beaten into fourth place by the BNP at the 2008 election.

This form would suggest that Labour's Stephen Wood should have little trouble holding the seat.  Kevin Brown, who came third in Denton ward last year and comes from Gosforth, is the new Liberal Democrat candidate, while Marian McWilliams tries again for the Conservatives after standing here in 2012 and 2011.  Six other candidates have been nominated on what will be a crowded ballot paper: in alphabetical order they are Martin Collins for the Greens, Bobbie Cranney for the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition, independent Davy Hicks, Olga Shorton for the localist Newcastle upon Tyne Community First Party (standing under the description "It's Time to Put Newcastle First"), independent Reg Sibley and UKIP's Lorraine Smith.

WOLLATON WEST, Nottingham city council; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Steve Parton at the age of 64.  In his first term as a Nottingham councillor, Parton suffered a stroke while campaigning in the recent Wollaton East and Lenton Abbey by-election.

The ward of Wollaton West covers the whole of Wollaton Park together with housing to the north and west, including the old village of Wollaton which was swallowed up by Nottingham many years ago.  This is one of the most desirable places to live in Nottingham, with competition for places at the local schools being fierce.  One rather unexpected local resident is Batman: Wollaton Hall, former home of the Willoughby family in the middle of Wollaton Park, was used as the exterior of Wayne Manor in the most recent Batman film, The Dark Knight Rises.  (Inside the hall is the Nottingham Natural History Museum.)

While the local residents may not be as rich as Bruce Wayne, given the ward's demographics it's no surprise to find that this is a safe Conservative ward.  In fact, it's Nottingham's only safe Conservative ward, and somewhat of a bastion; even a doubling of the Labour vote in the 2011 election couldn't seriously threaten the blue team.

Batman and the other local residents have six candidates to choose from.  The Tories have gone for youth in defending this ward, having selected 22-year-old James Spencer who works for a media relations company in the Creative Quarter of the city centre.  He fought Wollaton East and Lenton Abbey in the 2011 election.  His main opposition will come from Labour's Steve Battlemuch, a parent governor at the local Fernwood School who is described as heavily involved in the local community.  The Liberal Democrats have a very experienced campaigner in the shape of businesswoman and former lecturer Barbara Pearce, who has stood for Parliament three times including as the SLD candidate in the 1989 Richmond by-election which sent William Hague to Parliament for the first time, following up on that by fighting Leeds North West in the two 1990s elections.  Nottingham Business School lecturer Chris Clarke stands for UKIP, while the Green Party candidate, psychotherapist Katharina Boettge, comes here straight from fighting the Bilborough ward by-election in April; she is top of the Greens' East Midlands list for next year's Euro-elections.  In this rogues' gallery it's a matter for debate which candidate represents which Batman character, but there is one definite Joker: the final candidate is regular frivolous by-election candidate David "Militant Elvis" Bishop, who will be hoping to attract more votes than the 115 he received here in the 2007 election by highlighting his opposition to High Speed 2 on the ballot paper.
