There are five by-elections on 4 July 2013 with both the major parties in action.  The Conservatives are under pressure from the Liberal Democrats in wards in Norfolk and Oxfordshire, while Labour are defending three coalfield wards: they should not be worried about losing safe wards in Swansea and Tyneside but will face a stiffer fight in a Staffordshire ward where UKIP are strong.

ABINGDON FITZHARRIS, Vale of White Horse district council, Oxfordshire; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Holly Holman in protest over the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill.

One of England's oldest towns, Abingdon on Thames has been occupied since the Iron Age.  The town had one of the oldest abbeys in England, the Saxon Abingdon Abbey; after the Conquest the Normans gave the place a vote of confidence as the future King Henry I was educated there.  Following the dissolution of the Abbey Queen Mary I granted the town a borough charter, after which it assumed the title of county town of Berkshire.  Although it lost this title to Reading in the mid-nineteenth century, Abingdon became a prosperous town in the twentieth century, with major employers including MG cars and the Morland brewery, original brewers of the Duke of Edinburgh's favourite tipple Old Speckled Hen.  Today the town is home to many professionals who work in science and computing, major scientific employers such as UKAEA, Harwell Laboratory and Oxford University being nearby, and the town also being the home of the educational computing supplier RM and the antivirus company Sophos.  Despite this prosperity, Abingdon is one of the largest towns in southern England without a railway station.

Local election results in Abingdon tend to be close fights between the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives.  This ward's two seats were split between the two parties in 2003; the Conservatives lost their seat to the Lib Dems in 2007 but won one seat back in 2011 to give the ward split representation again.  Continuing this theme, the ward is split between two divisions of Oxfordshire county council, one of which (Abingdon North) elected a Conservative and the other (Abingdon South) a Liberal Democrat.

This by-election, however, can only have one winner.  Defending for the Conservatives is town councillor Monica Lovatt, a former nurse who now volunteers with a Forces charity and has recently finished a term as Mayor of Abingdon; she is the wife of Sandy Lovatt, county councillor for Abingdon North, and was the unsuccessful Conservative candidate here in 2011.  The Lib Dem challenge is led by Jeanette Halliday, another of the town councillors for the ward.  Finally, George Ryall is the Labour candidate.

AYLSHAM, Broadland district council, Norfolk; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Jo Cottingham.  Deputy leader of the council until last year and Aylsham ward councillor since 2004, Cottingham stepped down following a complaint about her conduct.

Here we have another ancient market town.  Nine miles to the north of Norwich on the River Bure, Aylsham was important in mediaeval times as a major centre for the linen and worsted industry.  Thanks to its location about halfway between Norfolk and Cromer, the town became a stop on the coaching route between them, and the coaching Black Boys Inn is one of the town's oldest buildings.  Still a local market town and agricultural centre, Aylsham was one of the first British members of the Cittaslow or "Slow City" movement.  As well as the town, the Aylsham ward includes the parishes of Burgh and Tuttington to the east, Marsham to the south, and Oulton and Blickling to the north; Blickling is a major tourist attraction thanks to the Jacobean stately home Blickling Hall, a former home of the Boleyn family.

Aylsham is a closely fought Lib Dem/Conservative ward and its three councillors have been split between the two parties since 2004; the 2004 election returned two Lib Dems and one Conservative, with the Tories gaining one of the Lib Dem seats in 2007 and topping the poll at the most recent election in 2011.  In May's Norfolk county council election the Liberal Democrats held the Aylsham county division (which also includes the much-smaller Buxton ward to the south-east) within an increased majority as UKIP split the Conservative vote.

With no UKIP candidate on the ballot paper for the district by-election, this should be a closer result.  Defending for the Conservatives is Judi Meredith, a former district councillor who unsuccessfully fought this ward in 2004 and 2007.  The other two candidates both live some distance away: Steve Riley, who lives on the RAF Coltishall airbase, will try to gain the seat for the Lib Dems, and the Labour candidate is Wroxham-based Malcolm Kemp.

LLANSAMLET, Swansea city council; caused by the death of the Lord Mayor of Swansea Dennis James at the age of 68, from pancreatic cancer.  First elected to Llansamlet division in 1985, James, a Labour councillor, spent his working life in the construction industry and had a degree in civil engineering from Swansea University.

Centred on junction 44 of the M4 motorway, this is a suburban ward to the north-east of Swansea, containing the communities of Llansamlet (south of the motorway) and Birchgrove (north of the motorway).  Llansamlet was a coal-mining area originally, but in 1981 much of the former mining property was designated as the UK's first enterprise zone and has now been extensively redeveloped into Swansea Enterprise Park, Swansea's largest out-of-town shopping area and a major centre for local employment; Morgan Crucible, the Land Registry and Welsh Water are major employers here.  Llansamlet also has a railway station, with trains every two hours to Swansea and Cardiff (no Sunday service).

One of the few remaining four-seat wards in Wales, from 2004 to 2012 the Labour Party held three of the four seats with the fourth going to independent councillor June Evans, who topped the poll at the 2004 election but lost her seat heavily in 2012.  The Liberal Democrats came quite close in a July 2007 by-election, the Swansea East constituency being a target for them at the time, but that was the closest Labour have come to losing this ward to another party.

It's unusual for local by-election candidates to have their own Wikipedia pages, but such is the case for the defending Labour candidate Bob Clay, who was the MP for Sunderland North between 1983 and 1992.  Labour have presumably forgiven Clay, who will join his wife as a ward councillor if elected, for being election agent to Reg Keys in his run against Tony Blair at the 2005 general election.  The Tories are running James Hatton, deputy chairman of Swansea East Conservatives, while the Lib Dems have selected party staffer Samuel Rees.  The ballot paper is completed by Claire Thomas, standing for the National Front.

RIVERSIDE, North Tyneside metropolitan borough council; caused by Labour councillor Norma Redfearn being elected Mayor of North Tyneside in the May elections.

Last week this column took you to Jarrow on the south bank of the Tyne estuary; this week we travel north from Jarrow through the Tyne Tunnel to Riverside ward on the opposite bank of the river.  Straddling the old border between Wallsend and Tynemouth, Riverside ward consists of a series of disconnected residential areas, running from Willington Quay to the west to the centre of North Shields at the eastern end; other centres of population include Percy Main and the southern fringe of Howdon.  Fishing and coalmining were traditionally the major industries here; while coal is no longer mined here the collieries have been redeveloped into various business parks and industrial estates, and the link with the sea is still important as this ward includes Newcastle's international ferry port, from which there are daily sailings to Amsterdam.  The Tyne and Wear Metro links the ward together, with Howdon, Percy Main, Meadow Well and North Shields stations all serving the ward.

This ward has trended strongly to Labour in the last few years after a few close fights at the end of the Blair era: 54-46 against an Independent in 2006 and 56-44 against the Lib Dems in 2007.  The most recent election in 2012 was also a straight fight, but much more comfortable as Labour beat the Tories 85-15.

Defending for Labour is Wendy Lott, the wife of one of the remaining Labour councillors for the ward.  She is up against Barbara Stevens, a Conservative former councillor who stood down last year in Collingwood ward.

SILVERDALE AND PARKSITE, Newcastle under Lyme borough council; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Thomas Lawton for personal reasons.  Lawton had not attended any meeting of the council in three months.

Another Labour defence, and another ward with a coal-mining heritage, in this case quite a recent one.  Silverdale is a large pit village just to the west of Newcastle-under-Lyme, whose mine (Silverdale Colliery) did not close until 1998 after being greatly expanded in the 1970s.

You might have thought this would produce a safe Labour ward like the other two Labour are defending this week, but if so, you would be wrong.  The fun started in 2003 when Labour spectacularly lost the ward (which had been very safe the previous year) to Eileen Braithwaite of the Caring Party.  Braithwaite thereafter joined the UK Independence Party, and Newcastle-under-Lyme's UKIP branch became one of the most successful in the country during the mid-noughties, building up a large group on the borough council.  It wasn't enough to deliver UKIP both seats in the ward, but Braithwaite was re-elected in the purple colours in 2007 before losing to Labour in 2011 by 40 votes.  UKIP actually peaked in Newcastle at the 2009 Staffordshire county elections in which they became the official opposition to the Conservatives; while they went backwards in May in terms of seats they did hold the county division covering this ward, by just four votes over Labour.

Defending for Labour in the by-election is Amelia Rout, a research officer and Unison official at Staffordshire University.  UKIP have selected Elaine Blake, who was a Labour councillor for this ward until stepping down in 2010.  An interesting fight is in prospect.  Also standing are James Vernon for the Conservatives and Richard Steele for the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition.
