Just one poll on 18th March 2013, in West Sussex.

ANGMERING, Arun district council, West Sussex; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Julie Hazlehurst who had served as a district councillor for the ward since 2003.

Nestled between the South Downs and the coast, Angmering is a large village just off the main A27 road along the Channel coast.  Essentially a commuter village for Worthing, to which there are four trains each hour from the village's railway station, Angmering has grown strongly in recent years: the ward's population increaed from 5,812 in the 2001 census to 7,788 in the 2011 census, making the village one of the largest centres of population in the largely rural Arundel and South Downs parliamentary constituency.  The population could grow yet further in the near future, with 500 new homes pencilled in for the parish in Arun council's development plan.  Angmering ward also includes the tiny parish of Poling to the west, and stretches north into the South Downs National Park to the summit of Harrow Hill.

With Arundel and South Downs being one of the safest Conservative seats in the whole of the UK, getting opposition candidates to stand against the Tories here can be a struggle.  The Conservatives were opposed for the three seats only by a single Lib Dem candidate in 2003, and by a single UKIP candidate in 2007.  In between the Tories polled almost 74% of the vote at a summer 2006 by-election.  In 2011 the ward's opposition to the Tories did manage to get three candidates together, one each from the Lib Dem, Labour and UK Independence Parties, and that was the order in which they finished, very close to each other nearly 800 votes away from the third Conservative candidate.

Defending for the Conservatives is Andy Cooper, chairman of the parish council in Rustington just over the railway line, who runs a sportswear/leisure shop in Littlehampton.  He is opposed by two candidates: fellow Rustington parish councillor Jamie Bennett, for the Lib Dems, and Angmering resident Carly Godwin for Labour.
