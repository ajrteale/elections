There are six by-elections on 1st August 2013.  Top of the bill is a by-election to the Welsh Assembly for the Isle of Anglesey Ynys Môn constituency, being defended by Plaid Cymru who also have a council-level by-election to defend at the other end of the country in Caerphilly.  In England, UKIP have two recently-gained county council seats to defend in Kidderminster and Thetford, the Tories will try to keep a marginal district council seat in Clitheroe and Labour will seek a successor for a district council seat in Derbyshire.

YNYS MÔN, National Assembly for Wales; caused by the resignation of Plaid Cymru AM Ieuan Wyn Jones to head the new Menai Science Park.  The MP for Anglesey from 1987 to 2001, Jones had served on the Welsh Assembly since its inception in 1999.  He was leader of Plaid Cymru from 2000 to 2012, and served as Deputy First Minister of Wales from 2007 to 2011 as Plaid went into coalition with Labour in the Assembly.

This seat is easy to define: it is Isle of Anglesey and associated islands, of which the most important is Holy Island.  Relatively low-lying compared to much of north Wales, Anglesey's economy is based on agriculture (the island may have the world's northernmost olive grove) and tourism, although there is a fair amount of industry, notably the Wylfa nuclear power station near Amlwch on the north coast; Amlwch itself is an industrial town built to serve major nineteenth-century copper mines on Parys Mountain.  The town of Holyhead on Holy Island is one of the UK's most important ferry ports with more than two million passengers every year using the ferries to and from Dublin and Dun Laoghaire, but the aluminium smelter which formerly underpinned the town's economy (and was the UK's single biggest user of electricity) closed down in 2009.  Back on the main island is RAF Valley, home of a fast jet training school and search and rescue helicopters and presently employing the Duke of Cambridge, although he is on paternity leave at the moment following the birth of Prince George last week.  

While Holyhead and Valley are essentially a self-contained economic unit, much of the eastern half of the island, including the tourist centre of Beaumaris, is within the orbit of the city of Bangor on the mainland, to which Anglesey is connected by two bridges: Thomas Telford's Menai Suspension Bridge, built to carry the London-Holyhead road and the world's first modern suspension bridge, and Robert Stephenson's Britannia Bridge, rebuilt in 1970 following a fire to carry both rail and road traffic to the island.  

At the centre of the island is Llangefni, home to the much-maligned county council which became so consumed by infighting and corruption that the Welsh Government suspended its powers in 2011 and appointed commissioners to run the island from Cardiff.  Following new elections in 2013 the councillors are back in control, the majority Independent group running the council in coalition with Labour.

Anglesey is one of the longest-surviving constituencies with unchanged boundaries, the island having formed one constituency since 1885 when the Beaumaris District of Boroughs (one of the more notorious pocket boroughs, controlled by the Viscounts Bulkeley and the Williams-Bulkeley baronets) was abolished.  The first MP for the united island was Richard Davies of the Liberals, a radical nonconformist from a timber-importing family who had sat for the county constituency since 1864 and had recently been appointed Lord-Lieutenant of Anglesey.  Davies retired in 1886, citing opposition to Irish Home Rule, and was replaced by Thomas Lewis, who handed over in 1895 to Sir Ellis Ellis-Griffith, 1st baronet, a barrister who served in Asquith's administration.  Sir Ellis was defeated in the 1918 election by Sir Owen Thomas who became the island's first Labour MP.  Sir Owen died in 1923 and Labour lost the by-election back to the Liberal candidate Sir Robert Thomas, a ship and insurance broker who had previously been MP for Wrexham from 1918 and lost to Sir Owen in the 1922 general election.  Sir Robert handed over in 1929 to Wales' first female MP, Lady Megan Lloyd George.  Despite (or perhaps because of) Lady Megan's opposition to the National Government she had little trouble being re-elected until after the Second World War, the 1945 election being the first of three hard-fought contests with the Labour candidate, Holyhead town clerk Cledwyn Hughes, who finally emerged victorious in the 1951 election.  

Cledwyn Hughes had a long and rather successful political career, peaking in the second Wilson administration in which he served in the Cabinet as Welsh Secretary and Agriculture Minister; later, as Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos, he was leader of the opposition in the House of Lords.  At his first re-election in 1955 both the Conservatives and the Liberals nominated candidates called Hughes to stand against him, which must have been confusing; later, in 1964, all three opposition candidates were called Jones.

Since 1951 Anglesey has settled into an interesting pattern with its election results: no MP who seeks re-election on the island is ever defeated, but no retiring MP has passed the seat on to a candidate of the same party.  So on Cledwyn Hughes' retirement in 1979 Labour (who stood the former Cardiganshire MP Elystan Morgan), lost the seat to Brighton councillor and TA major Keith Best who became the island's first (and so far only) Conservative MP since 1725.  Best proved to be a scandal-prone figure: he was involved in a road accident which killed his PA and, although he was cleared of responsibility for that, he was later fined (and served a few days in prison) after being found guilty of fraud over the BT share allocation.  If anything, Best was more influential after leaving Parliament in 1987, being named by the Guardian in 2003 as one of the hundred most influential people in UK public services: at the time he was chief exec of the Immigration Advisory Service and chairman of the council of the Electoral Reform Society.

Best was replaced by Ieuan Wyn Jones, the island's first (and so far only) Plaid Cymru MP.  Jones served as the MP until 2001 when he stood down from Wesminster to concentrate on the Assembly; true to form Plaid failed to keep the seat, and since 2001 the MP for the island has been Labour's Albert Owen, a former merchant seaman and CAB advisor who had been runner-up to Jones in the first Assembly election in 1999.

At Senedd level Jones has won all four elections on the island, the closest result coming in 2003 when he was less than nine points ahead of the Conservatives' Peter Rogers, list Assembly member for North Wales in the first Assembly.  Rogers, who had been demoted to an unwinnable position on the list at that election in favour of the fuel tax protestor Brynle Williams, quickly broke with the Conservatives and stood for the island as an independent in the next three Westminster and Senedd elections, finishing runner-up again in the 2007 election at which Jones increased his majority.  Without Rogers on the ballot the Conservatives narrowly took second place from Labour at the 2011 Assembly election.  

This is the first by-election to the Assembly since Blaenau Gwent in 2006, and there is a lot at stake: since the 2011 elections Labour have held exactly half of the 60 seats, and a Labour gain in this by-election would give them an absolute majority in the Assembly for the first time.

Defending the seat for Plaid Cymru is the former BBC/S4C newsreader Rhun ap Iorwerth, from the Anglesey hamlet of Llangristiolus.  The Conservative candidate is Rev Neil Fairlamb, the Rector of Beaumaris.  Labour's candidate is Tal Michael from Rhos-on-Sea, ex-Islington councillor, son of the former First Minister of Wales Alun Michael and Labour's candidate in the North Wales Police and Crime Commissioner election last year.  That went well.  The Lib Dems have also selected a candidate from the mainland, Gwynedd (and former Barking and Dagenham) councillor Steve Churchman, re-elected unopposed in the 2012 election by Dolbenmaen division.  Also standing are Nathan Gill, a businessman from Llangefni, for UKIP, and Kathrine Jones, from Bethesda on the mainland, for the Socialist Labour Party.

PENYRHEOL, Caerphilly county borough council; caused by the death of Plaid Cymru councillor Anne Collins at the age of 72.  Retired after a long career in the health service, Collins was first elected to Penyrheol community council in 1985 and had been a Caerphilly councillor since 1999, serving as Mayor of Caerphilly in 2008/9.

Ynys Môn isn't the only seat that Plaid have to worry about this week.  One of Wales' rare four-member council divisions, the Penyrheol division covers a series of residential areas in the lower Aber Valley; Pen-yr-heol itself climbing up the eastern hillside of the valley, Trecenydd and Energyln on the other hillside, and the tiny hamlet of Groes-wen.  The division has the same boundaries as the Penyrheol, Trecenydd and Energlyn community council.

This division has been a consistent stronghold for Plaid Cymru for some years, thanks partly to the popularity of local councillor Lindsay Whittle, twice Plaid leader of Caerphilly council and since 2011 a member of the Welsh Assembly for South Wales East.  Whittle consistently beats the alphabet to come of the poll here.  In the 2004 and 2008 elections his Plaid slate won all four seats in the division rather comfortably, but Labour gained one of the seats in 2012 to split the division's representation.

The defending Plaid candidate is Steve Skivens, a retired firefighter from Energlyn who was the defeated Plaid candidate in 2010.  His main opponent will be Labour's Gareth Pratt, a teacher.  Tory candidate Cameron Muir-Jones, from Energlyn, will be looking for a better result than the 24 votes he polled in last year's New Tredegar by-election.  The ballot paper is completed by Jaime Davies for the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition.

THETFORD WEST, Norfolk county council; caused by the resignation of newly-elected UK Independence Party councillor Peter Georgiou after it was revealed that he is banned from entering a local supermarket due to shoplifting.

Thetford West, as you might guess, covers the west of the town of Thetford together with a large part of Thetford Forest to the west of the town.  A large market town on the Cambridge-Norwich road and the Ely-Norwich railway line, Thetford was the capital of the Kings of East Anglia during the Heptarchy and the seat of a bishopric, which moved to Norwich during the early twelfth century.  More modern characters commemorated with statues in the town are Thomas Paine, whose statue depicts him holding a copy of his Rights of Man, held upside down; and Capt George Mainwaring of the Warmington-on-Sea home guard.  Many of the outside scenes in the BBC comedy series Dad's Army were filmed in and around Thetford.

County elections in the town have also been funny affairs.  Thetford West division was solidly Labour in 2005, the party polling 48% and the Conservative/Lib Dem opposition being evenly divided.  In 2009 the order of the three parties completely reversed with the Lib Dems finishing on top with 37%, 52 votes ahead of the Conservatives who were themselves only 176 votes ahead of Labour.  But the 2013 result was even stranger: the defending Liberal Democrats crashed to fifth place and the Conservatives were well out of it, the campaign turning into a battle between Labour and UKIP, UKIP coming out on top by just one vote and winning with 35% of the vote.

You really can't get any more marginal than that, and with UKIP having lost a by-election last month in which another of their councillors resigned due to a scandal the omens are not good for them.  Their new candidate is John Newton, who is retired after running a local engineering business for 25 years.  Labour have re-selected Terry Jermy, district and town councillor for Thetford-Saxon ward and still only 27 years old, to try and find the two extra votes he needs to win.  Tristan Ashby, an ex-firefighter and Attleborough town councillor, tries again for the Tories after his third place in May.  The Greens are the third party to reselect their candidate from May, Sandra Walmsley in their case, while the Lib Dem candidate from May Danny Jeffrey is also standing again, but this time as an Independent.

ST MARY'S, Worcestershire county council; caused by the death of newly-elected UK Independence Party councillor Tony Baker at the age of 69.

For the second UKIP defence this week we travel to a very urban division: St Mary's division covers the western side of the Worcestershire town of Kidderminster.  Fifteen miles north of Worcester, Kidderminster has an interesting mix of industries, with bespoke carpets, solid-fuel rocket motors and luxury yachts all manufactured in the town; the red carpet used at the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge came from Kidderminster.

Kidderminster is of course associated with the Health Concern movement, opposed to the closure of the casualty department at Kidderminster Hospital, which ran the Wyre Forest district council for several years.  St Mary's, however, is not one of Health Concern's better areas.  In May 2005 the division voted Labour in a close three-way split, Labour being 73 votes ahead of the Conservatives who were themselves only 130 votes ahead of the Lib Dems.  Labour won with just 28% of the vote.  The 2009 election saw a comfortable Conservative gain with the Lib Dems winning a close race for second place ahead of Health Concern and UKIP.  In 2013 UKIP went from fourth to first in another close three-way split, UKIP winning with just 27% of the vote, 50 votes ahead of the Conservatives who were 38 votes ahead of Labour.

Since the May elections UKIP have already lost one of their Worcestershire county council seats in the Stourport-on-Severn by-election after their councillor was revealed to have anti-Semitic and other very dubious stuff on his Facebook; while no-one is at fault for this by-election the party will still have to perform well to hold the seat.  Their new candidate is Peter Willoughby.  The Tories' Nathan Desmond, who was county councillor for the division from 2009 until May, wants his seat back.  Another former county councillor standing is Mumshad Ahmed, who gained the town's St Georges and St Oswald division from the continuing Liberal Party in 2009; however, that was as a Conservative and now Ahmed is standing for Labour, as he did in this division in May.  Health Concern have also renominated their May candidate, Graham Ballinger, and independent candidate Helen Dyke completes the ballot paper.

CODNOR AND WAINGROVES, Amber Valley district council, Derbyshire; caused by the death of Labour councillor George Parkes at the age of 68.  A manager at a Derby metal company, he had first been elected to Amber Valley council in 2010 and served for six years as chairman of Codnor parish council.

"There is in the North a single-line system of tramcars which boldly leaves the county town and plunges off into the black, industrial countryside, up hill and down dale, through the long, ugly villages of workmen's houses, over canals and railways, past churches perched high and nobly over the smoke and shadows, through dark, grimy, cold little market-places, tilting away in a rush past cinemas and shops down to the hollow where the collieries are, then up again, past a little rural church under the ash-trees, on in a bolt to the terminus, the last little ugly place of industry, the cold little town that shivers on the edge of the wild, gloomy country beyond. There the blue and creamy coloured tramcar seems to pause and purr with curious satisfaction. But in a few minutesthe clock on the turret of the Co-operative Wholesale Society's shops gives the timeaway it starts once more on the adventure. Again there are the reckless swoops downhill, bouncing the loops; again the chilly wait in the hill-top market-place: again the breathless slithering round the precipitous drop under the church: again the patient halts at the loops, waiting for the outcoming car: so on and on, for two long hours, till at last the city looms beyond, the fat gasworks, the narrow factories draw near, we are in the sordid streets of the great town, once more we sidle to a standstill at our terminus, abashed by the great crimson and cream-coloured city cars, but still jerky, jaunty, somewhat daredevil, pert as a blue-tit out of a black colliery garden."
- DH Lawrence, 'Tickets, Please!'

Lawrence here was talking about the tram service from Nottingham to Ripley, known as the "Ripley Rattler", which passed through his home town of Eastwood and on to the next stop, the mining village of Codnor on the Nottingham-Matlock road and the last stop before Ripley.  The tram service, and the trolleybus that replaced it in the early 1930s, might have been useful if it had survived, for Codnor has not been bypassed and now suffers severe traffic problems.  In countryside at the edge of the village is the ruined Codnor Castle, a thirteenth-century construction of William Peverel (of the Peak), while the more recent mining legacy - opencast mining still goes on in the area - is commemorated by the Codnor Wheel, one of the late Cllr Parkes' achievements.  The Codnor and Waingroves ward combines Codnor with Waingroves, a suburb of Ripley, and the Cross Hill area on the road to Heanor.

The ward has consistently voted Labour over the last decade, but hasn't always been safe; the Labour majority over the Conservatives was cut to just one vote in 2008 and the Tories were only 22 votes behind at the 2010 election.  As in many industrial areas, the formation of the Coalition led to a large rise in the Labour vote and the 2012 result shows that this ward is now very safe for Labour.

Defending for Labour is Isobel Harry who was Mayor of Ripley in 2004/5.  Another former Mayor of Ripley standing is the Conservatives' Ron Ashton, who lost his district council seat in Ripley and Marehay ward last year.  The UKIP candidate is Garry Smith from Waingroves, and the ballot is completed by the Lib Dems' Keith Falconbridge who gives an address in the Bulwell area of Nottingham.

LITTLEMOOR, Ribble Valley district council, Lancashire; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Christine Conner for personal reasons.  Conner was first elected by Littlemoor ward in 2011 having previously been a councillor for Read and Simonstone ward.

The Littlemoor ward is south-eastern Clitheroe, a mostly residential area at the bottom of Pendle Hill, next to the road which climbs up to the Nick o' Pendle before descending into the treacle-mining stronghold of Sabden.

Clitheroe is generally a strong Lib Dem area, but the party is on the wane here; while the yellows still topped the poll in the 2011 election they lost one of the two seats in this ward to the Tories' Christine Bartrop (as she then was).  Recent by-elections in Clitheroe, and the gain of the town's county council seat from the Lib Dems in May, are further encouraging signs for the local Conservatives.

The by-election is likely to be a close fight between Jean Forshaw for the Conservatives, a first-time candidate, and Clitheroe town councillor Jim Shervey who was the defeated Lib Dem candidate in 2011.  Also standing are Liz Webbe for Labour and independent candidate Steve Rush.
