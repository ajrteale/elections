Six by-elections will be held on 17th October.  In the north of England, the Conservatives and Lib Dems have rural seats to defend at opposite ends of Cumbria, while in the south of England the Lib Dems, Labour and the Conservatives defend seats in Luton, Thurrock and Sussex respectively.  On the Welsh Elections blog Labour are on the defensive in a Port Talbot by-election with several bizarre features.

DALSTON, Carlisle city council, Cumbria; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Nicola Clarke who is moving away from the area to be closer to her family.

This is one of Carlisle's rural wards, covering the parishes of Dalston, Cummersdale and St Cuthbert Without immediately to the south of Carlisle.  Dalston, the first stop out of Carlisle on the Cumbrian Coast railway line, is the largest population centre in the ward and has a decent amount of industry, with a Nestlé factory making powdered milk and a BP fuel depot.  The Dalston parish covers a wide area including the hamlets of Gaitsgill and Raughton Head further up the Caldew valley.  Cummersdale is a small Carlisle dormitory village, while the St Cuthbert Without parish runs along the A6 and West Coast Main Line to the south of Carlisle, including the villages of Wreay, Blackwell and Durdar together with some Carlisle overspill.  Possibly the main reason to visit the ward is Carlisle Racecourse, which is located at Blackwell.

Since 2004 Dalston's three seats have been split between the Tories and Lib Dems, the Conservatives finding themselves unable to unseat Lib Dem councillor Trevor Allison, who has seen his majority increase from one vote at the 2004 election to 552 at the most recent poll in 2012.  A second Lib Dem councillor was elected in 2006 but the Conservatives recovered that seat in 2010, and Nicola Clarke was re-elected in 2011 just as comfortably as Allison was the following year.  The ward is split between two Cumbria county council divsions: at the last county elections in May Allison won the Dalston division with a seven-point lead over the Tories, while in Wetheral division (which includes the St Cuthbert Without parish) the Tories won with UKIP second.

Make of that what you will.  Carlisle-based Michael Randall will try to defend the seat for the Conservatives, while the Lib Dems have selected Dalston resident Michael Gee.  The Labour candidate is Ruth Alcroft, from the village of Aglionby east of Carlisle, while UKIP's nominee is Robert Dickinson, who stood in May's county election in Dalston.  The Greens' James Tucker completes the ballot paper.

LEVENS, South Lakeland district council, Cumbria; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Mary Orr on medical advice.

"The world is too much with us; late and soon,
Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers:
Little we see in Nature that it ours;
We have given our hearts away, a sordid boon!
The Sea that bares her bosom to the moon;
The winds that will be howling at all hours,
And are up-gathered now like sleeping flowers;
For this, for everything, we are out of tune;
It moves us not. --- Great God!  I'd rather be
A Pagan suckled in a creed outworn;
So might I, standing on this pleasant lea,
Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn;
Have sight of Proteus rising from the sea;
Or hear old Triton blow his wreathed horn."

Wordsworth composed those words while wandering through the marshes around the Westmorland village of Heversham, at the head of Morecambe Bay on the Kent estuary.  Heversham, with its twelfth-century church on an eighth-century site, is the southernmost village in the Levens ward, which fills the space between Kendal and Morecambe Bay.  Levens itself lies at the centre of the ward and is known for the Elizabethan manor house of Levens Hall with its fantastical topiary garden.  Levens Hall is still in private hands, but the ward's other stately home, Sizergh Castle in the Helsington parish at the nothern end of the ward, is now in the care of the National Trust although still home to the Strickland family.  The Stricklands were were major landowners in Westmorland and their name is commemorated electorally in the name of one of Kendal's wards.

The local parliamentary constituency, Westmorland and Lonsdale, is now one of the safest constituencies for the Liberal Democrats, Tim Farron having increased his majority to enormous proportions at the 2010 election thanks to the substantial Labour vote in Kendal voting tactially Lib Dem almost en bloc.  Levens ward, however, was voting strongly Liberal Democrat long before Farron got into Parliament, and if anything has been swinging towards the Conservatives over the last decade, although it has not yet achieved marginal status.  Mary Orr was elected for the ward in a May 2011 by-election following the death of the previous councillor, and re-elected for a full term in 2012, beating the Conservative candidate 56-40 (the Greens were the only other party to stand).  The ward is split between two county council divisions (Lower Kentdale and Lyth Valley), both of which voted Conservative in May's county election very comfortably.

This by-election is a straight fight.  In the yellow corner is Annie Rawlinson, a businesswoman from Levens who ran the 2013 London Marathon in aid of the Samaritans.  In the blue corner is the Tories' 2012 candidate for the ward, Brian Rendell from Leasgill in Heversham parish.  Seconds out!

BARNFIELD, Luton council, Bedfordshire; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Martin Pantling to take up a new career which is incompatible with his remaining a councillor.

North-eastern Luton this, along the A6 to Bedford and possibly best known for Barnfield College, Bedfordshire's largest FE college.  Politically this was a safe Lib Dem ward during the last Labour government with the Conservatives running second, but in 2011 Labour came from fourth place to split the ward's two seats.  Pantling was top of the poll 96 votes ahead of his running mate, who was beaten by the leading Labour candidate by just 14 votes.  The Tories, who always poll around 600-700 votes here, fell to third place but the lead Conservative candidate still finished in front of the second Labour candidate.

So a tough fight is in prospect where all three parties will fancy their chances.  Clive Mead, a former councillor for Challney ward who lost his seat in the 2011 election, defends the Lib Dem seat.  Francis Steer stands for the Labour Party and the Tories have selected local chartered account Geoff Simons.  Completing the ballot paper is the Greens' Simon Hall.

STIFFORD CLAYS, Thurrock council, Essex; caused by the death of Labour councillor Diana Hale at the age of 66.  Hale had served as a Thurrock councillor from 1988 to 1997, before being forced to resign to become principal of Thurrock Adult Community College; she returned to the council in 2007.

This is a residential area at the north end of Grays, off the A13 dual carriageway, about which I have very little to say.  So we'll move straight on to discussion of the ward's politics, which are more interesting.  This ward was a key marginal on Thurrock council during the tail end of the last Labour government: the Conservatives won the ward's two seats at the 2004 election (when the current boundaries were introduced) with majorities of 127 and 95 over Labour and held off Labour in 2006 by 34 votes.  Labour gained one of the Conservative seats in 2007 by 130 votes, in an election which saw a very high third-place BNP vote of 24%, and followed up in 2010 by gaining the second seat with a majority of 76.  The formation of the Coalition greatly reduced the area's Conservative vote and Labour's majority increased to 354 at the most recent election in this ward in 2011, UKIP finishing close behind the Conservatives in third place.

Defending for Labour is Sue Shinnick, an outsourced council administrator.  The Conservatives have selected former councillor and Kent county council officer Danny Nicklen, who still lives in his former ward in Stanford-le-Hope.  UKIP's candidate Clive Broad will hope to improve on the 24% and third place he achieved here in 2011.  The ballot paper is completed by Liberal Democrat candidate Ken Mulroue.

WESTBOURNE, Chichester district council, West Sussex; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Maureen Elliott.

For our final by-election this week we travel to the most westerly village in Sussex, hard up against the River Ems which forms the border with Hampshire.  This village is aptly named Westbourne, and its parish has the same boundaries as the Westbourne ward of Chichester district.  Westbourne's claim to fame is that the churchyard has England's oldest yew avenue.  Part of the parish (including the hamlet of Aldsworth) lies within the South Downs National Park.

To describe Chichester politics I can do little better than quote Anthony Wells, who stated in his Almanac of British Poltiics that even once the revolution comes the Chichester Workers' Soviet would be Conservative.  Thus are Westbourne politics; since the turn of the century the closest the Tories have come to losing the ward was at the most recent election in 2011, when they beat a Liberal Democrat candidate 62-38.  However, local politics became interesting this year when UKIP gained the local county division (Bourne) from the Conservatives by 83 votes.

What effect will this have on the by-election?  Hoping "not a lot" is the defeated county councillor from May, Mark Dunn, who is the Conservative candidate for the ward by-election; he is from the village of Stoughton, in the South Downs to the north-east.  Southbourne parish councillor, writer and historian Philip MacDougall is the Liberal Democrat candidate.  UKIP's candidate is Alicia Denne, from Bosham on Chichester Harbour.  Also standing in the by-election are former Labour PPC Andrew Emerson for a new far-right outfit called Patria, and Green Party nominee Thomas French.

SANDFIELDS EAST, Neath Port Talbot county borough council, West Glamorgan; caused by the death of long-serving Labour councillor Collin Crowley.  Crowley had been a councillor for more than forty years, starting in 1972 on the old Port Talbot borough council; he spent most of his working life with British Steel after serving in the Merchant Navy.

You might have thought that a rather depressed council estate built on sand dunes behind the Port Talbot seafront wouldn't have many interesting features.  You'd be wrong: in fact this column could turn into an episode of Ripley's Believe it or Not if I'm not careful.

First up, we have the south-west facing Aberavon Beach, once a traditional seaside resort for the population of the Valleys.  Draw a straight line from the beach in the right direction and the first land you hit is in Brazil; with the entire Atlantic ocean to generate waves Aberavon Beach is very popular with Wales' surfers.  For swimmers of a gentler disposition there was the Afan Lido, a leisure centre on the seafront which also hosted a gym and a concert hall until it was destroyed by fire at the end of 2009; Neath Port Talbot council recently gave planning permission for a replacement.  One part of the complex which survived the fire is the home ground of the Welsh premier league football side Afan Lido FC.  Other attempts to prettify the promenade include the "Kite Trail" sculpture by Andrew Rowe, which is claimed to be the largest sculpture in Wales.

Interesting though all these things are, we should attempt to get back on topic and consider the ward itself, the housing estate behind the seafront, which was built in the 1950s to house workers at Port Talbot steelworks and their families.  The first seriously bizarre thing about the ward is its boundary: the ward has a detached part.  This detached part is a roughly circular area less than twenty metres across on land within Port Talbot Docks.  This is private land but essentially empty, with nothing today in the detached part of the ward but grass.  Old maps fail to shed any light on why this detached part exists.  With an area of 0.094 hectares (less than a quarter of an acre) this is the smallest electoral unit in the United Kingdom, or it would be if it was populated.

While the populated part of Sandfields East ward does have the strong Labour vote you might expect from a depressed estate in a place like Port Talbot, this isn't enough for Labour to sweep the board at election time due to the presence of popular and long-serving Independent councillor Lella James, who has topped the poll at every contest in this ward since the turn of the century.  Normally finishing at the other end of the ward's contests (although he did beat an independent candidate in the 2012 election) is the other seriously bizarre thing about this ward, eccentric charity fundraiser and baked bean museum curator Captain Beany ("from the Planet Beanus"), who has been appearing on the area's ballot papers for the last two decades with his one-man "New Millennium Bean Party".  

Mike Davies, defending for Labour, is probably favourite to win to the by-election.  Captain Beany, having wound up the New Millennium Bean Party, will fight his 22nd election campaign as candidate of the Port Talbot Residents Association, fresh from pushing a vacuum cleaner around the Cardiff Half-Marathon course earlier this month in a time of just over four hours; this time he appears on the ballot paper under his real name, Barry Kirk.  Also on the ballot paper are representatives of three parties who have not previously contested the ward: Richard Minshull for the Conservatives, Keith Suter for UKIP (whose record against Beany in this area is played 1, lost 1) and Daniel Thomas for Plaid.
