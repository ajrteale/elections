The last day of February 2013 has got rather buried in a very significant week in my life.  On the 27th, I was at my grandmother's funeral; on 1st March I attain the advanced age of thirty.  I'm not sure which of these is more depressing.  In an attempt to cheer myself up, here are previews of the four by-elections being held in England today, and it's fair to say that one of them is much more significant than the others.  Kris will be covering this week's Scottish by-election in Coatbridge separately; this post will go on to describe the week's three English local by-elections, in which all three parties have a seat to defend (the Tories on the Wirral, Labour in Kent, and the Lib Dems in south-west London), but first there is an extended trip to a corner of suburban Hampshire which has been the focus of much attention this past month.

EASTLEIGH borough constituency, House of Commons; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat MP (and former MEP and leadership contender) Chris Huhne who has pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice.

Oh good, here we go.  This is the first by-election since the formation of the Coalition in a Lib Dem/Tory seat, and the first to be caused by the resignation of a Liberal MP since (arguably) Leith in 1927.  With Eastleigh's marginal status the campaign has been a cracker.

There has been an Eastleigh constituency continuously since 1955.  The 1955 constituency was drawn to reduce the electorate of the Winchester and New Forest constituencies, and wrapped around the whole of the landward side of Southampton like a pair of earmuffs, from Totton (now in the New Forest East constituency) in the west to Netley and Hamble-le-Rice in the east.  It was the first constituency to divide three separate rural districts.  At the time this was a fairly rural area, and my 1950 road atlas shows a Southampton much smaller than it is today, with much of the area east of the Itchen relatively undeveloped.  Indeed at its first election in 1955 the Eastleigh constituency had just 48,929 voters.  At the time most of those would have lived in Eastleigh itself, which was then a working-class town dominated by the railways; the London and South Western Railway had opened their locomotive works here in 1891, replacing the original works at Nine Elms in London.  At the other end of the modern seat, Hamble is a rather posh yachting centre with some high-end manufacturing (including a large aerospace factory and a BP oil terminal), while Netley at the time was dominated by the Royal Victoria Military Hospital, where soldiers had convalesced since the Crimean War, although the hospital was already falling into disuse by this point.  The seat has good transport links thanks to the M3 and M27 motorways, the Eastleigh railway station with its good links to London and Southampton, and Southampton Airport, which is located in the constituency; these links have gradually transformed the seat into a commuter area for both Southampton and London.

The Eastleigh constituency didn't remain small for long, as new estates were built and the population grew.  Former villages such as Hedge End became towns in their own right.  The M27 motorway was built through the constituency, bypassing Southampton and linking the villages of the constituency together.  The Boundary Commission has struggled to keep up with the expanding population here: by 1970 the electorate had grown to 76,167, and the boundary changes implemented in February 1974 knocked less than a thousand voters off that figure.  Five years later the electorate was 85,400, and a further set of new boundaries in 1983 (by now no longer including Totton) lost fewer than 3,000 voters.  At the 1992 general election, mainly due to the continued growth of Hedge End, Eastleigh was the fourth largest constituency in the UK with 91,736 electors - only East Hampshire, the Prime Minister's seat of Huntingdon, and the perennial special case of the Isle of Wight were larger.  Hedge End's growth has now slowed down - there's not much space left - and the Boundary Commission seem to have finally got a handle on the problem of keeping the constituency's size down; the last boundary review transferred just 2,500 electors in Chandler's Ford West ward out of the seat.  Opened in 2001, probably the most famous of the constituency's recent developments is Hampshire county cricket club's Rose Bowl ground in West End, which hosted an England Test match against Sri Lanka in 2011.  (The match was ruined by rain and ended in a draw which England had the better of; Ian Bell and Kumar Sangakkara scored centuries and Chris Tremlett took six wickets in Sri Lanka's first innings.)

Throughout all this upheaval Eastleigh had just one MP for its first 37 years as a separate constituency: Sir David Price, an Old Etonian Tory who had served in the Second World War with the Scots Guards and was president of the Cambridge Union in 1948.  Sir David was pushed very close by Labour at the constituency's first contest in 1955 and in the Wilson landslide of 1967, in both of which the Tory majority was under a thousand, but after that he saw his lead in the constituency blossom.  He is still alive at the age of 88, having retired from the Commons in 1992 and passed on a 13,335-vote majority over the Liberal/Alliance to his successor Stephen Milligan, a former Oxford Union president and SDP figure who had been a journalist with the Economist, the BBC and the Sunday Times during the 1980s.  At Milligan's only election in 1992 he defeated the Liberal Democrat candidate David Chidgey by 17,702 votes, increasing the Conservative majority.

Anybody who remembers the Major years knows what happened next.  Fast forward to the first Monday of February 1994, when Milligan's secretary entered his London flat to find the MP dead with electrical cord around his neck and feet and an orange in his mouth.  The inquest heard that Milligan had accidentally asphyxiated himself, and the coroner recorded a verdict of misadventure.

Coming in the middle of the ill-fated Back to Basics campaign, one of your MPs autoerotically asphyxiating himself is not exactly helpful, and the by-election was never going to be easy.  It was held with four other parliamentary by-elections on Euro-election day in June 1994, but with the other four all being in safe Labour seats (Barking, Bradford South, Dagenham and Newham North East) this one was the centre of attention.  Renominated by the Liberal Democrats, David Chidgey, a civil engineer, ran away with the by-election, gaining a 21% swing from the Conservatives and winning by 9,239 votes over the Labour candidate Marilyn Birks, a drama lecturer who would go on to serve eight years on Eastleigh council; the Tories' Stephen Reid, the leader of Basingstoke and Deane council, trailed in third.  One Nigel Farage came in fourth of the six candidates for the UK Independence Party, just 169 votes ahead of the Official Loony Lord Sutch.

It wasn't all plain sailing for Chidgey, who faced-off again against Reid in the 1997 general election and this time held on by just 754 votes, confirming the by-election gain; Labour came within less than 5,000 votes of winning and the seat briefly looked like a three-way marginal.  This large Labour vote was successfully squeezed by Chidgey at his final election in 2001, in which he increased his majority to 3,058 ahead of the new Tory candidate Conor Burns, leader of the party group on Southampton city council, who would eventually go on to be elected to Parliament in 2010 in Bournemouth West.

David Chidgey retired to the Lords in 2005 and was replaced as Liberal Democrat candidate by Chris Huhne, who had been a Lib Dem MEP for south-east England since the introduction of proportional representation in 1999.  The son of Ann Murray, a voice of the speaking clock, he had previously been a City entrepreneur, which had made him a millionaire, having gone into that from journalism; Huhne had been economics editor of the Grauniad and business editor of the Independent and Independent on Sunday, amongst other things; one of his first major jobs was as Brussels correspondent of the Economist, a job for which he was well suited having been educated at Oxford and the Sorbonne.  While at Oxford he was active in Labour student politics and edited Isis magazine, in which he allegedly wrote an article saying that illegal drugs were an accepted facet of our society.

With Conor Burns trying again for the Tories, this was never going to be an easy campaign.  But in the end the results of Huhne's two successful general elections campaigns (he had been a Liberal/Alliance candidate in the two 1980s elections) followed the same pattern as Chidgey's results.  In 2005 Huhne squeaked past the Conservatives by a three-figure majority (568 votes this time) before putting the squeeze on the Labour vote to get a much larger majority at his next election.  This time the Tory candidate beaten by Huhne, who by now had unsuccessfully stood twice for the party leadership, was Maria Hutchings, who in 2005 had confronted Tony Blair on live Channel 5 TV about the closure of autistic schools.

One of the architects of the coalition agreement after the 2010 election, Huhne became Energy Secretary in the coalition government, serving in Cabinet until February 2012 when he was charged with perverting the course of justice following an allegation by his ex-wife, Vicky Pryce, that he had pressurised her into accepting driving licence penalty points after his car was caught by a speed camera.  Huhne pleaded guilty to the charge on 4th February 2013 and forthwith resigned his seat in Parliament.  He will be sentenced at a later date once Pryce's trial on the same charge has concluded.

Huhne's resignation has prompted a by-election which promised to be just as fascinating as the last Eastleigh by-election nineteen years ago, and the campaign has certainly lived up to that billing.  Defending for the Lib Dems, and appearing thirteenth of the fourteen candidates on the ballot paper, is Mike Thornton, an Eastleigh borough councillor since 2007 who lives in the town and represents Bishopstoke West ward.  With Huhne damaged goods, the Liberal Democrats have decided to accentuate the positive in their choice of candidate by going for somone strongly associated with the local council, an unmitigated success story from their point of view; the Lib Dems and their predecessors have been the largest party on Eastleigh council for all but two years since 1986 and controlled the council continuously since 1994.  The party's council majority keeps going up and up and now the local party weeps, for there are no more wards left to conquer; the Lib Dems have won every single district ward within the constituency at every election since 2007, when they failed to gain Eastleigh South (easily the borough's most working-class ward) from Labour by just six votes.  The last time the Tories won a council seat in the constituency was in 2004 (in Hamble-le-Rice and Butlocks Heath ward).  All six of the Hampshire county council divisions wholly or partly within the constituency boundary elected Lib Dem county councillors in 2005 and 2009.  At the most recent district council election in 2012, while four of the wards in the constituency were not up for election the only ward which would be described as marginal was Eastleigh South, in which the Lib Dems held off Labour by 13 votes; the closest the Tories came to winning a seat was 15.5 points in both Botley, and Hamble-le-Rice and Butlocks Heath wards, while the relatively well-organised local UKIP branch contested every ward and came second in Bishopstoke East and Netley Abbey.  It would appear from all this that the local council Lib Dem candidates have polled well in excess of Huhne over the last few years.  Maybe Huhne had a negative personal vote?

The Conservatives renominated Maria Hutchings, from West End, for her second tilt at the seat, a decision which they may have come to regret, as during the campaign she has proven to be something of a loose cannon; in the last week of the campaign she failed to appear at a radio hustings apparently for that reason.  Labour have gone for a minor celebrity in the shape of author and broadcaster John O'Farrell, best known in Labour circles for his 1998 memoir "Things Can Only Get Better", who has previous election experience, standing in his home town of Maidenhead in 2001 against Theresa May; he gives an address in the Vauxhall constituency.  O'Farrell has proved himself able to answer tough questions from Jeremy Paxman, being captain of 	an Exeter alumni team in the 2012 University Challenge Christmas specials.  The UKIP candidate is Diane James, an independent district councillor for the Surrey village of Ewhurst since winning a 2006 by-election.

The other ten candidates can be politely described as also-rans.  In alphabetical order they are Wessex Regionalist Colin Bex, from Winchester; perennial by-election candidate David Bishop, from Nottingham, for the Elvis Loves Pets Party; Jim Duggan, from Horsham, a long-standing figure in the Peace Party which saved its deposit in the recent Middlesbrough by-election; Ray Hall, from Hedge End, for his Beer, Baccy and Crumpet Party; Official Monster Raving Loony leader Howling Laud Hope, from Fleet in Hampshire; doctor and former Green Party figure Iain Maclennan, from Bursledon, a yachting village within the constituency, standing for National Health Action, a party backed by former Kidderminster Hospital/Health Concern MP Richard Taylor; Eastleigh resident Kevin Milburn for the Christian Party; Daz Procter, an RMT (shipping) figure from Havant, for the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition; local resident Danny Stupple standing as an independent and campaigning against gay marriage; and regular English Democrats by-election candidate Michael Walters, from Rochester in Kent, who has had a go at several Kent local by-elections in recent months.

The Lib Dems have the dubious advantage of one celebrity endorsement from a local resident: Stephen Gough, the naked rambler.

Although constituency polling is still an inexact science and has a dubious track record in the UK, two pollsters have tried their hand at getting a couple of balanced samples together for the constituency.  For what it's worth, here are the results:

Populus for Lord Ashcroft, 4th-5th Feb: C 34 LD 31 Lab 19 UKIP 13 (sample size 1006)
Survation for the Mail on Sunday, 6th-8th Feb: LD 36 C 33 UKIP 16 Lab 13 (sample size 504)
Survation for the Mail on Sunday, 18th-22nd Feb: C 33 LD 29 UKIP 21 Lab 13 (sample size 543)
Populus for the Sunday Times, 21st-22nd Feb: LD 33 C 28 UKIP 21 Lab 11 (sample size 1001, don't knows excluded)

So, if you believe the opinion polls, the only thing that can really be read into this is that the contest is too close to call and we're heading for an exciting result in which both the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives are neck-and-neck and UKIP are polling very well.  It's Sunday as I write this, and no doubt there are more twists to come in this by-election; we'll find out the result in the early hours of Friday morning.

BEAVER, Ashford district council, Kent; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Rebecca Rutter after just over a year in office, believed to be for personal reasons.

Having comprehensively gone over my word limit on Eastleigh, the local by-election previews this week will be a little abbreviated.

One of the boom towns of modern Britain thanks to its location and good transport links, Ashford is an old market town which became a major railway junction in the nineteenth century.  It is now linked to London and the Channel Ports by the M20 motorway and the Channel Tunnel Rail Link, with high-speed trains taking just 37 minutes to reach St Pancras.  The growth of Ashford has meant the town has spilled outside its old boundaries to swallow up several surrounding villages, and Beaver ward (named after Beaver Lane), which was originally the south-west corner of the town, is now just part of the urban sprawl.

Beaver ward is a fairly working-class area and was safe Labour in 2003. Unusually it swung towards the Conservatives at the next two ordinary elections.  In May 2011 the two Labour candidates were just 29 and 27 votes ahead of the Conservatives; the Ashford Independents, a well-organised localist group with five Ashford councillors, finished in a strong third place.  One of the Labour councillors died shortly afterwards; the resulting by-election, in November 2011, saw Labour increase their majority over the Conservatives in a much more crowded field, and there was much worse to come for the local Tories as their candidate in the by-election, landlord Cengizhan Cerit, was found to have forged nine of the ten signatures on his nomination papers.  Cerit was found guilty of electoral fraud earlier month and is now serving a one-year prison sentence.  This by-election is caused by the resignation of the winner of the November 2011 by-election.

Defending for Labour is Jill Britcher, a retired tutor organiser.  This time the Conservatives have selected Jane Martin, the daughter of Ashford councillor Marion Martin and the only candidate to live outside the town (in the North Downs village of Shottenden, which is closer to Canterbury than Ashford).  Retired voluntary worker Jack Cowen is trying again for the Liberal Democrats after contesting the last by-election.  The Ashford Independents have selected the former councillor and 1995/6 Mayor of Ashford Palma Laughton, who runs a sewing workshop.  Mark Reed, a public sector worker, tries again for the Green Party.  Angharad Yeo, the daughter of Ashford Labour councillor (and NEC member) Harriet Yeo, is the UKIP candidate, and 2009/10 Mayor of Ashford John Holland is standing as an independent.

BERRYLANDS, Kingston upon Thames Royal Borough council, South London; caused by the death of Liberal Democrat councillor Frances Moseley.  A Kingston councillor since 2006, she was the council's lead member for Better Homes.

London suburban sprawl here; this part of Surbiton is a commuter area just off the south-western main line, running south-west from Berrylands railway station (half-hourly trains to Waterloo, taking 24 minutes).  Like Eastleigh further down the main line, this is a hard-fought marginal area between the two coalition parties.  The Conservatives won all three seats convincingly in 2002, the Lib Dems took all three seats in 2006, the third seat by just six votes from the lead Conservative candidate; and the 2010 result was effectively a carbon copy of 2006 except that this time the lead Conservative was six votes ahead of the third Lib Dem.  In last year's GLA elections Boris beat Ken here 55-23, while the list vote had decent shares for all four parties represented in the Assembly (C 38 Lab 21 LD 18 Grn 11).

The Lib Dems will try to hold this by-election with solicitor Sushila Abraham.  Her main rival is the Tories' Mike Head, a former bank manager.  Sports journalist Tony Banks is the Labour candidate, Ryan Coley is standing for the Greens and Michael Watson for UKIP.

PENSBY AND THINGWALL, Wirral metropolitan borough council, Merseyside; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Don McCubbin, who is retiring and moving to London.

Thingwall is a good name for a council ward; the "thing" in the name is an old Norse word meaning "assembly", a word which also occurs in Tynwald, the name of the Manx parliament (a word with an identical etymology to Thingwall - "assembly field"), and the Althing, the name of the Icelandic parliament.  This Thingwall is not in a tax haven, but on the Wirral, that strange peninsula between Liverpool and Wales which would rather be part of neither.  Thingwall and Pensby are two villages which have merged together in the centre of the peninsula, on the road from Birkenhead to Heswall; Pensby in particular is effectively part of Heswall.

Pensby and Thingwall together create an interesting ward which has turned into a three-way marginal.  When the ward was created in 2004 the three council seats here were split between two Conservatives and one Liberal Democrat councillor.  The Lib Dems held their seat in 2006 and then gained the two Conservative seats in 2007 and 2008.  One of the Lib Dem councillors resigned in early 2010 because of work commitments, so there was a double vacancy election on general election day in 2010, at which the Lib Dems topped the poll but the Conservatives gained the by-election seat, the Labour vote here recovering to respectability after plumbing the depths in the later Blair and Brown years.  The Tories confirmed their by-election gain at the 2011 election, the Lib Dems crashing to third and Labour finishing just 245 votes behind the Conservatives.  In 2012 Pensby and Thingwall elected a councillor from its third different party in as many years, Labour gaining a seat from the Lib Dems in a close three-way marginal result, Labour being 189 votes ahead of the Conservatives who in turn were 138 votes ahead of the Lib Dems.

This adds up to a fascinating ward which pretty much anybody could still win.  Labour have the advantage of being the most recent of the three main parties to win here, but they did poorly in the last two Wirral by-elections just four weeks ago, losing Leasowe ward to the Conservatives.  The Tories can take heart from that result and a strong hold in the neighbouring Heswall ward on the same day, although they are on the defensive here and the two January by-elections were the last local by-elections they won; so far the Conservatives have drawn a complete blank in February, losing the two seats they were defending.  The Lib Dems can take solace from the fact that this is one of the few Merseyside wards where their vote has not utterly collapsed since the formation of the Coalition.

The Tory defence is led by Sheila Clarke, a former councillor who lost her seat in Bebington ward last year.  Labour's candidate Phillip Brightmore had a good go at the safe Conservative Clatterbridge ward this year and his reward is an eminently winnable by-election.  The Lib Dems, UKIP and the Greens have all re-selected their candidates from last May, Damien Cummins, Jan Davison and Allen Burton respectively, and the ballot paper is completed by the English Democrats' Neil Kenny.
