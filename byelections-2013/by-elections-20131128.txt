BILLINGE AND SENELEY GREEN, St Helens metropolitan borough council, Merseyside; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Alison Bacon.  Bacon's resignation came in May, so this by-election has taken an unusually long time to be called.

A few weeks back we had a by-election in Winstanley, the first village out of Wigan on the road to Sentelens.  This week we travel a little further along that road over the Merseyside boundary to the village of Billinge, on a hilltop location overlooking the Merseyside conurbation; Billinge Hill is the highest point of Merseyside at 587 feet, with views all over north-west England and even as far as Snowdonia.

The Billinge Chapel End parish, which covers the village, is combined for electoral purposes with the parish of Seneley Green, or, as it's known to everyone else, Garswood.  Effectively a suburb of Ashton-in-Makerfield, Garswood has more of a commuter profile, lying as it does on the Wigan to Liverpool railway line.

The area's economy is historically based on coal-mining, although the coal here was close enough to the surface for drift mining to be preferred to deep mining, and there is still some opencast mining going on in the area.  That coal-mining history creates a Labour history in the ward, and Labour have won every contest in Billinge and Seneley Green since the last boundary changes in 2004 (including an October 2010 by-election), although they came within 43 votes of losing the ward to the Conservatives at the Labour nadir of 2008.  In recent years the opposition vote has fallen back and Labour can now look on this ward as a stronghold.

So the Labour candidate, Billinge Chapel End parish councillor Dennis McDonnell, shouldn't have too much to worry about.  His opposition will come from the Conservatives' John Cunliffe (from St Helens), the Green Party's Sue Rahman (from Billinge), UKIP's Laurence Allen (from St Helens), the BNP's Alan Brindle (from Billinge) and the Lib Dems' Noreen Knowles (from St Helens).

CADDINGTON, Central Bedfordshire council; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Ruth Gammons whose husband is seriously ill.

This is Bedfordshire's southernmost ward, being a series of villages in the Chiltern Hills immediately to the south of Luton and Dunstable.  At the east end is Hyde parish, based around the Luton Hoo country house hotel and its large estate, a favourite location for film producers; Hyde has never been annexed by Luton, resulting in it forming a weird salient to the south of Luton within Central Bedfordshire council.  Moving further west we have the brickworking parishes of Slip End, where the official start-of-works ceremony for the M1 motorway took place, and Caddington itself.  To the west of the A5 Watling Street are the parishes of Kensworth, Studham and - the main reason to visit the ward - Whipsnade, home of the Zoological Society of London's Whipsnade Zoo.  The zoo, the chalk quarry at Kensworth, the Luton Hoo estate and commuting to Luton form the basis of the ward's economy.

Zoo animals don't vote, of course, so the area's political character is shaped by its human residents.  Don't be confused by the presence of Caddington, Hyde and Slip End within the safe Labour Luton South constituency; this is a strongly Tory area, the Conservatives polling almost two-thirds of the vote at the 2011 election and easily winning both seats.  The predecessor Bedfordshire county council divisions and South Bedfordshire district council wards were just as strongly Conservative.

Defending for the Conservatives is Caddington parish councillor Kevin Collins.  Kensworth resident Ian Lowery is the Labour candidate, the Lib Dems have selected Houghton Regis town councillor Alan Winter, Caddington-based Christine Smith stands as an independent and the UKIP candidate is Steven Wildman, who gives an address some distance the other side of Luton in Barton-le-Clay.

HORBURY AND SOUTH OSSETT, Wakefield metropolitan borough council, West Yorkshire; caused by the death of the Mayor of Wakefield, Labour councillor Brian Holmes, at the age of 75.

Horbury is the next centre of population up from Wakefield in the Calder Valley, and traditionally on the edge of Yorkshire's Heavy Woollen District.  As well as wool and other textiles (a major employer here was the tennis-ball manufacturer Slazenger) Horbury was also a centre for railway wagon manufacture, which continued right up until the 2000s when the Voyager trains were built here.

During the 2000s this ward was consistently marginal, the three seats splitting 2 to Labour and one to the Conservatives.  The Tories held their seat in 2006 and gained the Labour seats in 2007 and 2008, but could never make the ward safe; the largest Tory majority was 199 votes at the 2007 election.  In that context the Conservatives did very well to hold the ward at the 2010 election with a majority of 102, but after that it has been one-way traffic for Labour, who now hold all the ward's three seats following gains at the 2011 and 2012 elections and a July 2011 by-election.  The Tories will not have been helped at the 2012 election by their outgoing councillor Graham Jesty standing as an Independent and polling well.

Rory Bickerton, whose Twitter profile reads "25, Labour lad, Opera, Mozart and other nice things", defends the seat for Labour.   The Tories have selected Angela Holwell, who is fighting her first local election campaign for over seven years.  UKIP have recruited the independent candidate from 2012, former Tory councillor for this ward Chris Jesty, and regular Lib Dem candidate and Vote UK forum contributor Mark Goodair stands here for the seventh time since 2002.

LANDWARD CAITHNESS, Highland council; caused by the resignation of SNP councillor Alex MacLeod after he was charged with exceeding his election expenses limit at the 2012 ordinary election.  When elected he was 19 years old and the youngest-ever Highland councillor.

Welcome to the far north.  Caithness has a population of around 24,000 (for the purposes of comparison, roughly the same as Radcliffe) spread over 712 square miles.  Sixty per cent of that population is accounted for by the county town of Wick and the port of Thurso, so the rest of the county - which forms this ward - is essentially empty by English standards.  However, by Highland standards this rural area is relatively well-populated; the topography is generally flat and fertile, and many small farming and crofting hamlets have survived outside the main towns.  Not that the whole area is fertile; a large chunk of Caithness extending into Sutherland is covered by the Flow Country, Europe's largest expanse of blanket bog and a candidate for World Heritage Site status.

The main centres of population in the ward are Castletown on the north coast, the inland village of Halkirk, and the settlements of Lybster and Dunbeath on the south-east coast and the road to Inverness; the main reasons to visit are the tourist trap of John o' Groats, the most northerly point on the British mainland at Dunnet Head and, in between the two, the late Queen Mother's former holiday home at the Castle of Mey.  However, the main contributor to the ward's economy is the nuclear research establishment at Dounreay to the west of Thurso, whose decomissioning - ongoing since 1994 - still supports a large number of jobs.

This is not a very party political area.  At the last elections to Highland council under first-past-the-post in 2003 all four of the predecessor wards were uncontested, with two Liberal Democrats and two Independents being elected.  The introduction of PR in 2007 led to a shake-up; two new independent councillors were elected, the Lib Dems lost a seat to the SNP, and the one independent councillor who stood for re-election (as a Labour candidate) was defeated.  In 2012 the two independent councillors (Willie MacKay and Robert Coghill) were easily re-elected, the SNP passed their seat on to MacLeod, and the Lib Dem councillor retired; with no Lib Dem candidate to replace him, his seat was taken by a third Independent.  Independent councillor Robert Coghill resigned earlier this year on health grounds, and the ensuing by-election - held in May - was won by his wife Gillian in the first round.

This second by-election in the ward this year will be defended by the SNP's Ed Boyter, from Reay west of Thurso, who has a fight on his hands considering that the SNP have never polled above 21% in the ward.  There are three rival Independent candidates standing: in alphabetical order they are Tina Irving, a freelance writer from Thurso; Matthew Reiss, who has recently retired as chief of police in Thurso; and Winifred Sutherland, a businesswoman from Dunbeath.  Completing the ballot paper is the Conservative candidate, B&B owner Kerensa Carr from Dornoch on the east coast of Sutherland, which is an hour's drive from anywhere in Caithness.  Presumably she is only a paper candidate.

VASSALL, Lambeth London borough council, South London; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Kingsley Abrams, apparently so he could seek selection as the Labour parliamentary candidate for the Brent Central constituency.  The selection is still ongoing, but he didn't make the shortlist.

This Lambeth ward runs south from Kennington Park along the Brixton Road, west of Clapham Road and south of Camberwell New Road.  Named after the first developer here in the 1820s, Henry Vassall-Fox, 3rd Baron Holland, the ward's Wikipedia entry notes the area's high level of deprivation and that more than half of the ward's households are socially rented.  Famous former residents include Vincent van Gogh and John Major, and from 1998 to 2002 two of the three ward councillors were journalist Dan Sabbagh, now national news editor of the Guardian, and economist (and niece of Peter and Virginia Bottomley) Kitty Usher, who would later serve one term as Labour MP for Burnley.

During the 2000s and into 2010 this Labour ward was under threat from the Liberal Democrats, who finally broke through at the 2010 election to take one of the three seats.  Although the Lib Dems crashed to fourth here in last year's GLA elections, they did poll a relatively good 11% in the Assembly ballot (to 54% for Labour, 15% for the Tories and 13% for the Greens).  Ken beat Boris in the ward's ballot boxes by 55% to 24%.

The defending Labour candidate is Paul Gadsby, a local resident described as an active local community campaigner.  Colette Thomas, a local childminder, is the Liberal Democrat candidate.  The Conservatives have selected the local Conservative Association treasurer Kelly ben-Maimon.  Also on the ballot paper are some names which will be familiar to regular readers of this column: Rachel Laurence for the Greens, Elizabeth Jones for UKIP, Danny Lambert for the Socialist Party and Steven Nally for the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition.

With the six-month rule now in effect leading up to the 2014 local elections, this is expected to be the last local by-election in London before the all-out elections for the London boroughs on 22nd May 2014.  Any further London vacancies which occur before then will be left unfilled.

WINKFIELD AND CRANBOURNE, Bracknell Forest council, Berkshire; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Mary Ballin at the age of 72.  Ballin had been the council's executive member for transport and planning for many years, and had been the election agent for Andrew MacKay, the former MP for Bracknell.

One of the rural wards of Bracknell Forest, this ward is essentially the area between Bracknell and Windsor Great Park; the northern end of the large Winkfield parish together with a small part of Warfield parish.  Obviously, it's a very Tory area; the closest the Conservatives have come to losing the ward in recent years was in 2007 when they had majorities of 280 and 260 over an independent candidate, who had fought the ward in 2003 as a Lib Dem.  The 2011 election gave the Conservatives 71% of the vote here against evenly divided Labour and Lib Dem opposition.

The defending Tory candidate is Winkfield parish councillor Susie Phillips, who runs a company which makes and sells paper flower decorations.  Chartered accountant Paul Birchall is the Lib Dem candidate, Janet Keene - who fought the Bracknell parliamentary seat in 2005 - stands for Labour, and business advisor Ken la Garde is the ward's first UKIP nominee.

We should also note a result from the by-election in TOPCLIFFE to Hambleton district council, North Yorkshire, caused by the resignation of Conservative former council leader Neville Huxtable.  The name might suggest a clifftop location, but Topcliffe is in fact a village in the centre of the Vale of York, on the left bank of the Swale.  Its location, and the fact that the Vale tends to fill with freezing fog in the winter, means that the village has a propensity for very low temperatures; three years ago the Topcliffe weather station set the Yorkshire low temperature record at minus 19 degress Celsius.  That weather station is located at Topcliffe Airfield, an army barracks which is also used by the RAF for glider training.  The ward named after Topcliffe is a large rural area to the south and south-west of Thirsk, stretching from Skipton-on-Swale at the west end to Hutton Sessay at the east end.

Your columnist has fond memories of the Happy Eater on the A168 at Topcliffe, a favourite stop on childhood journeys to see grandparents in Hartlepool.

Huxtable had been the councillor for Topcliffe throughout the last decade, and was unopposed at the 2007 election; in 2003 and 2011 he defeated Liberal Democrat opposition very comfortably indeed.  Polling for the by-election caused by his resignation had been set for 12th December, but when nominations closed last week there was only one candidate, the Conservatives' Garry Key, who has therefore been elected unopposed.
