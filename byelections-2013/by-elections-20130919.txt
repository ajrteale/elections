COSELEY EAST, Dudley metropolitan borough council; caused by the death of Labour councillor George Davies at the age of 75.  One of the last surviving members of the first Dudley MBC elected in 1973, Davies had represented this ward from 1973 to 1976 and again since 1985, chaired the housing committee for ten years and was Mayor of Dudley in 2000/1.

Welcome to the Black Country and to the old village of Coseley, which didn't really get going as a town until the mid-1920s, when it became the site of a factory for Bean cars and car parts, and when the Birmingham New Road - a dual carriageway connecting Birmingham with Wolverhampton - was built through the area.  With that road link and a frequent rail service to the two cities from Coseley railway station, it's arguable that the area is better linked with Wolverhampton than with Dudley.

This ward has consistently returned Labour councillors over the last nine years, although during the tail-end of the last Labour government it came under threat at various points from both the Conservatives and the BNP, who finished just twenty votes short of Labour at the 2006 election.  The area has swung strongly to the left since the formation of the Coalition and this is now a very safe Labour ward.

Defending for Labour is Clem Baugh.  For the Conservatives, Julian Ryder is seeking to get back on the council after losing his seat in the neighbouring Upper Gornal and Woodsetton ward last year; he is one of three candidates who fought that ward last year to stand in this by-election, along with UKIP's Star Etheridge and the National Front's Kevin Inman.  Last year's Green candidate for this ward Becky Blatchford tries again, as does last year's NF candidate Ken Griffiths, who this time has the BNP nomination; he was the BNP candidate who came within twenty votes of winning in 2006.

FOUR MARKS AND MEDSTEAD, East Hampshire district council; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Pat Seward.

High up in the Hampshire Downs, Four Marks lies about four miles south-east of Alton on the main road to Winchester.  It is connected to Alton by a station on the "Watercress Line" preserved railway.  The village is of fairly recent vintage, originally being settled in the mid-nineteenth century by Crimean War veterans.  To the north is the older-established village of Medstead.

When first created on its current boundaries in 2003 this ward was a close fight between the Conservatives and Lib Dems, with the two seats having Tory majorities of 61 and 10, but the Lib Dems have fallen back since then so far they aren't even contesting this by-election.  The county council division covering the area (Alton Rural) is also safely Conservative.

Ingrid Thomas leads the Conservative defence.  Janet Treacher, who fought Alton Eastbrooke ward at the last district council election in 2011 and the local county council division in May, is the Labour candidate, Ruth Duffin stands for UKIP and Majorie Pooley for the Green Party.

NORTH Ward, Oxford city council; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Alan Armitage.  Armitage had previously resigned as Lord Mayor of Oxford in March this year over inappropriate comments allegedly made to a schoolgirl, for which he was censured by the council's standards committee.

This is central North Oxford, starting at St Giles and moving north for about half a mile along the Banbury and Woodstock Roads.  The ward contains six of Oxford University's colleges: the former women's colleges of Lady Margaret Hall, St Anne's and Somerville; the postgrad Green Templeton and St Antony's; and the theological college of Wycliffe Hall, but also has a residential character: St John's College developed much of the land in the nineteenth century, allegedly for married dons, and many of the houses are noted examples of Victorian Gothic architecture, with some Regency buildings in Park Town.

The high turnover of Oxford's student population means that its wards can have very volatile results.  North ward in the Blair years was a Liberal Democrat ward with the Greens close behind; at the 2008 and 2010 elections the Lib Dems made the ward safe with the Tories as nearest challengers, but in 2012 Labour came from third place to win with the Greens second and the Lib Dems falling to third.  The ward is split between two county council divisions: the "gown" University Parks, which voted Green in May, and the "town" St Margaret's which was carried by the Lib Dems.

Defending for the Liberal Democrats is Tim Bearder, a former BBC journalist and son of the Lib Dems' South East MEP Catherine Bearder.  The Labour charge is led by Dr Louise Upton, an Oxford University research scientist who lectures at Christ Church.  The ward's regular Green Party candidate and former county councillor, psychotherapist Sushila Dhall, tries again, and the Conservative candidate is Oxford University Press accountant John Walsh.

SEASALTER, Canterbury city and district council; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Mike Sharp, who had represented the ward since 1999.

Today the western end of the resort town of Whitstable, the name of Seasalter is unusual in that it refers directly to the area's ancient industry: salt production, which made Seasalter prosperous during the Iron Age and resulted in Viking raids.  Much of the land in the area which has not yet been developed is still marsh.

This normally safe Conservative ward is now holding its second by-election in just four months, the first being held on county election day in May after another of the ward's three councillors emigrated.  On that day the Conservatives were run close by UKIP in the wider Whitstable county division, and the same was true of Seasalter which had a Tory majority of just 83 votes; much closer than the ordinary May elections since the millennium which normally have Labour as the leading challengers.

The new Tory candidate is Annette Stein, a lesbian homeopath and alternative medicine expert - certainly not the sort of candidate you usually see standing for the Tories.  Mike Bull, the leading UKIP candidate in May's county election, stands for UKIP.  Rachel Goodwin, a supermarket union steward and football coach, is the Labour candidate, Keith Hooker tries for the Lib Dems and Sturry-based Russell Page is the Green nominee.
