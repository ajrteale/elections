<H1 CLASS="chapter">Introduction and Abbreviations</H1><P>Elections were held on 4th May 2006 to all London boroughs and metropolitan boroughs, and some unitary authorities and shire districts in England.</P><P>The voting system used for all elections covered here was
first-past-the-post, with multi-member FPTP being used where more than
one seat was up for election. </P><P>All of the seats on the 32 London borough councils were up for election. The vast majority of London boroughs use multi-member wards electing three councillors each; there are also a handful of single-member and two-member wards. Elections to the London boroughs are covered in Part I, which has been split into two chapters (North and South London).</P><P>The 36 metropolitan boroughs are all elected by thirds. Each ward has
three councillors, with the councillor finishing third in the poll in 2004 (when the current ward boundaries were introduced) being up for
election in each ward. In some cases two seats were up for election,
due to the death or resignation of another councillor for the ward
within six months of the election. Results of these elections are
contained in Part II, which each of the former metropolitan counties
constituting a separate chapter.</P><P>The English unitary authorities and shire districts may have up to
three councillors in each ward, and may hold elections either all at
once or by thirds. 
Only those councils which elect by thirds held
elections this year; those councils which elect all at once were
last elected in 2003 and will next be elected in 2007. A few
districts elect by halves every two years; all of these districts held
an election this year. Where districts elect by thirds generally not
all of the wards in the district hold an election every year. A full explanation of the electoral arrangements is
given at the head of each council's entry.</P><P>Unitary election results are shown in Part III (with the
exception of the unitary districts covering Berkshire which have been treated as shire districts)
with shire district results in Part IV. Part III is
divided into eight chapters based on region, while Part IV has one
chapter for each county.</P><P>Finally, at the back you will find an Index of Wards.</P><P>Where a candidate in an election dies, the election in that ward or division is
cancelled and rearranged for a later date. This happened in the
following wards or divisions at this election:</P><UL CLASS="itemize"><LI CLASS="li-itemize">
None yet.

and selected other parties which fought several councils. This list
is not exhaustive; parties which put up only a few candidates will
generally have their abbreviation listed at the head of the entry for
the relevant council. Please note that the “Lab” label includes
candidates who were jointly sponsored by the Labour and Co-operative
Parties.</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">BNP - British National Party

supplied me with results, and particularly those dozens of council
webpages without which this work would not have been possible.</P><HR>
