<h1>Proposal for 62 constituencies for Cheshire, Greater Manchester, Lancashire and Merseyside</h1>

<h2>SUMMARY</h2>

<p>This document introduces my proposals for the forthcoming boundary changes for the counties of Cheshire, Greater Manchester, Lancashire and Merseyside.</p>

<p>In working these I used the following policies and assumptions:</p>

<ol>
<li>The policy for the new boundaries hasn't been published at the time of writing.  However, <a href="http://tinyurl.com/35orsgd">a Conservative amendment to the Constitutional Reform and Governance Bill tabled in February</a> does reveal some thinking.  Basically:
	<ol>
	<li>There is one electoral quota for the whole of the UK.</li>
	<li>All constituencies must be within +/-3.5% of the electoral quota.</li>
	<li>"All other special geographical considerations, including in particular the size, shape and accessibility of a constituency, shall be subordinate to achieving this aim".</li>
	</ol>
</li>
<li>The electoral quota is based on the number of parliamentary electors in the UK.  The Office for National Statistics publishes annual counts of parliamentary electors for each constituency: the most recent figure available (for 1st December 2009) shows a parliamentary electorate of 45,420,808.  Dividing this by 585 seats gives an electoral quota of 77,642, so a 3.5% tolerance gives a minimum size of 74,925 and a maximum size of 80,539 for each constituency.</li>

<li>The Boundary Commission for England have published on their website the parliamentary electorates of each ward for 1st December 2009.  These give a total electorate of 4,836,829 for the constituencies in Cheshire, Lancashire, Greater Manchester and Merseyside and 390,360 for Cumbria.  Dividing these figures by the electoral quota gives a total of 5.03 seats for Cumbria and 62.30 seats for the rest of the North West Region, so I have drawn 62 seats to cover Cheshire, Lancs, Gt Mcr and Merseyside.  All the electorates in this document are based on that source.</li>

<li>Last year I did proposals for each county separately on the "Equal Voting Size" thread in the <a href="http://www.vote-2007.co.uk">Vote UK forum</a>.  This is an updated version of those proposals, incorporating feedback from the thread, using the 2009 electoral register and the 3.5% tolerance, and taking a view over the whole area rather than county-by-county.</li>

<li>It's not possible to draw constituencies within this tolerance without splitting electoral wards in two.  Where I've done this I've had to estimate how many electors are in each part of the ward; because of the lack of precision I've shown the electorates of affected seats to the nearest 100.  I have tried to keep split wards to a minimum; overall I have split 21 wards.</li>

<li>Despite the bit about the size, shape and accessibility of constituencies, I have tried to bear in mind the local geography, demography and communication links.  I am not claiming to be entirely successful!</li>

<li>I have not been afraid to cross the metropolitan county boundaries where I think this will result in constituencies that better reflect local interests, or where it is necessary to do so in the interests of keeping within tolerance.</li>

<li>New wards are being drawn up for the two Cheshire districts so the boundaries in Cheshire are subject to change.
</li>

<h2>DETAILS</h2>

<h3>1. ACCRINGTON AND BLACKBURN NORTH (77960)</h3>

<p>(a) The following wards of Blackburn with Darwen: Beardwood; Little Harwood; Livesey; Roe Lee.<br/>
(b) The following wards of Burnley: Gawthorpe; Hapton<br/>
(c) The following wards of Hyndburn: Altham; Barnfield; Central; Church; Clayton-le-Moors; Huncoat; Milnshaw; Netherton; Overton; Peel; Rishton; Spring Hill.<br/>
(d) The following wards of Ribble Valley: Clayton-le-Dale; Mellor; Wilpshire.</p>

<p>A completely new seat drawn along the M65 motorway and the Blackburn northern ring road, running from Wilpshire to Padiham.  Accrington is the main town in the seat; the four Blackburn wards included are the middle-class northern and western suburbs of the town.  The main predecessor seat is Hyndburn.</p>

<h3>2. ALTRINCHAM AND SALE WEST (79116)</h3>
<p>The following wards of Trafford: Altrincham; Ashton upon Mersey; Broadheath; Brooklands; Bucklow-St Martins; Hale Barns; Hale Central; St Mary's; Timperley; Village</p>

<p>The two wards moved into the seat are Brooklands (from Wythenshawe) and Bucklow-St Martins (from Stretford).  Sadly a seat containing Altrincham and the whole of Sale would be too big.</p>

<h3>3. ASHTON-UNDER-LYNE AND STALYBRIDGE (78116)</h3>

<p>The following wards of Tameside: Ashton Hurst; Ashton St Michael's; Ashton Waterloo; Droylsden E; Droylsden W; Mossley; St Peter's; Stalybridge N; Stalybridge S</p>

<p>I've tried to redraw the Tameside constituencies to reflect the main communication links in the borough, which are to the north between Ashton and Stalybridge along the railway line and A635 road, and to the south between Denton and Hyde along the motorway.  This is the northern seat, the successor to Ashton-under-Lyne, and includes the towns of Mossley and Droylsden.</p>

<h3>4. BIRKENHEAD (c 80100)</h3>
<p>(a) The following wards of Wirral: Bebington; Bidston; Birkenhead; Claughton; Oxton; Prenton; Rock Ferry<br/>
(b) The northern part of Bromborough ward, Wirral (c 5300 electors; Port Sunlight and Spital)</p>

<p>Bebington ward and Port Sunlight move in from Wirral South.</p>

<h3>5. BLACKBURN AND DARWEN (78694)</h3>
<p>The wards of Blackburn with Darwen not included in Accrington and Blackburn North or Bolton North and Turton.</p>

<p>Rossendale and Darwen was always a bad constituency and this is my solution.  This seat, the successor to Blackburn, contains most of Blackburn town and the whole of Darwen.</p>

<h3>6. BLACKPOOL NORTH AND FLEETWOOD (78166)</h3>
<p>(a) The following wards of Blackpool: Anchorsholme; Bispham; Claremont; Greenlands; Ingthorpe; Norbreck; Warbreck<br/>
(b) The following wards of Wyre: Bourne; Carleton; Cleveleys Park; Jubilee; Mount; Park; Pharos; Rossall; Victoria; Warren</p>

<p>Roughly the same seat as in 1997&ndash;2010.  Successor to Blackpool North and Cleveleys.</p>

<h3>7. BLACKPOOL SOUTH (76443)</h3>
<p>(a) The wards of Blackpool not included in Blackpool North and Fleetwood.<br/>
(b) The Staining and Weeton ward of Fylde.</p>

<p>Roughly the same seat as in 1997&ndash;2010.</p>

<h3>8. BOLTON NORTH AND TURTON (80110)</h3>
<p>(a) The following wards of Bolton: Astley Bridge; Bradshaw; Breightmet; Bromley Cross; Crompton; Halliwell; Smithills; Tonge<br/>
(b) The North Turton with Tockholes ward of Blackburn with Darwen.</p>

<p>The successor to Bolton North East, but expanded to take in Smithills ward in the north-west of Bolton town and also North Turton ward from Rossendale and Darwen, reuniting the whole of Turton in one constituency (the area was split rather arbitrarily between Bolton and Blackburn in 1974).</p>

<h3>9. BOLTON SOUTH (77942).  </h3>
<p>(a) The following wards of Bolton: Farnworth; Great Lever; Harper Green; Hulton; Kearsley; Little Lever; Rumworth<br/>
(b) The Little Hulton ward of Salford</p>

<p>The current Bolton South East plus Little Hulton from Worsley and Eccles South.</p>

<h3>10. BOOTLE AND KIRKDALE (c 77000).  </h3>
<p>(a) The Everton and Kirkdale wards of Liverpool.<br/>
(b) The following wards of Sefton: Derby; Ford; Linacre; Litherland; Netherton; St Oswald<br/>
(c) The north-western part of Kensington and Fairfield ward, Liverpool (c 3200 electors).</p>

<p>The whole of Bootle and Litherland plus neighbouring wards from Liverpool.  Only a local can tell you where Bootle ends and Liverpool begins in this area.  Successor to Bootle.</p>

<h3>11. BURNLEY AND NELSON (76611).  </h3>
<p>(a) The wards of Burnley not included in the Accrington and Blackburn North or Rossendale seats.<br/>
(b) The following wards of Pendle: Bradley; Brierfield; Clover Hill; Marsden; Reedley; Southfield; Walverden; Whitefield</p>

<p>Just the two towns themselves without any of the surrounding rural areas in the current Burnley and Pendle constituencies.  Successor to Burnley.</p>

<h3>12. BURY NORTH (c 80200).  </h3>
<p>The areas of Bury not included in Bury South or Rossendale.</p>

<p>Much redrawn: takes Radcliffe from Bury South but loses southern Bury (Redvales ward) in return and also loses Shuttleworth from Ramsbottom ward to remain within tolerance.</p>

<h3>13. BURY SOUTH AND CRUMPSALL (c 80100).  </h3>
<p>(a) The following wards of Bury: Besses; Holyrood; Pilkington Park; Redvales; St Mary's; Sedgley; Unsworth<br/>
(b) The Crumpsall and Higher Blackley wards of Manchester.<br/>
(c) Part of Radcliffe West ward, Bury lying south of the River Irwell including the village of Outwood (c 2700 electors)</p>

<p>Radically redrawn, this becomes cross-borough by taking two wards from north Manchester.  My justification for throwing Crumpsall in here is that I went to a secondary school in Prestwich (now the Arts College), which was then a bog-standard comprehensive but attracted a lot of pupils from the Crumpsall area further down the tramline, on the grounds that their parents did not want their kids to go to Abraham Moss school!  This seat reunites Whitefield in one constituency.</p>

<h3>14. CHEADLE (c 76100).  </h3>
<p>(a) The Poynton ward of Cheshire East.<br/>
(b) The following wards of Stockport: Bramhall North; Bramhall South; Cheadle and Gatley; Cheadle Hulme North; Cheadle Hulme South; Heald Green<br/>
(c) Part of Stepping Hill ward, Stockport: the Norbury Moor area (c 2000 electors)</p>

<p>Loses part of Stepping Hill ward but crosses the GM boundary to include Poynton.</p>

<h3>15. CHORLEY (77318).  </h3>
<p>(a) The wards of Chorley not included in South Ribble or Westhoughton.<br/>
(b) The following wards of South Ribble: Bamber Bridge East; Bamber Bridge North; Bamber Bridge South; Coupe Green</p>

<p>A much redrawn seat, losing some rural fringes in the south-east (Adlington and Rivington) but gaining Bamber Bridge.</p>

<h3>16. CITY OF CHESTER (c 79200).  </h3>
<p>(a) The following wards of Cheshire West and Chester: Blacon; Boughton Heath; Broxton; City; Gowy; Hoole; Overleigh; Upton<br/>
(b) The part of Gowy ward, Cheshire West and Chester not included in Eddisbury.</p>

<p>Expands to the south as far as the Shropshire border.</p>

<h3>17. COLNE AND CLITHEROE (78171).  </h3>
<p>(a) The wards of Pendle not included in Burnley and Nelson.<br/>
(b) The wards of Ribble Valley not included in Accrington and Blackburn North.</p>

<p>Rural East Lancashire and Bowland, plus Colne.</p>

(b) Part of Alderley ward, Cheshire East: Eaton parish (c 290 electors)<br/>
(c) Part of Macclesfield Forest ward, Cheshire East: the parished part of the ward (c 4500 electors)</p>

<p>Expands to the north-east as far as the outskirts of Macclesfield.</p>

(b) The following wards of West Lancashire: Aughton and Downholland; Burscough East; Burscough West; Halsall; Rufford; Scarisbrick</p>

<p>Completely new seat containing Crosby, Formby, Burscough and the rural area between them.  It's this or split Formby.</p>

<h3>21. ECCLES AND WORSLEY (c 77000).  </h3>
<p>(a) The following wards of Salford: Barton; Boothstown; Cadishead; Eccles; Irlam; Walkden North; Walkden South; Winton; Worsley<br/>
(b) The western part of Swinton North ward, Salford (c 4300 electors)</p>

<p>The successor to Worsley and Eccles South, swapping Eccles town centre for Little Hulton.  Good swap there.</p>

<p>(a) The Cholmondeley ward of Cheshire East.<br/>

(c) Part of Gowy ward, Cheshire West and Chester: the parishes of Ashton Hayes and Kelsall (c 2900 electors).</p>

<p>The good thing about having a seat named after a hill no-one has ever heard of is that you can hack the boundaries around pretty much at will :)</p>

<p>(a) The following wards of Cheshire West and Chester: Central; Grange; Groves; Ledsham; Mickle Trafford; Sutton<br/>
