<H1 CLASS="chapter">Introduction and Abbreviations</H1><P>Elections were held on 5th May 2003 in England to all metropolitan
boroughs, many unitary authorities in England and almost all shire districts,
in Scotland to the Scottish Parliament and local authorities, and in
Wales to the Welsh Assembly.</P><P>The voting system used for all local government elections was
first-past-the-post, with multi-member FPTP being used where more than
one seat was up for election.</P><P>The 36 metropolitan boroughs are all elected by thirds. Each ward has
three councillors, with the councillor elected in 1999 being up for
election in each ward. In some cases two seats were up for election,
due to the death or resignation of another councillor for the ward
within six months of the election. Results of these elections are
contained in Part&#XA0;I, which each of the former metropolitan counties
constituting a separate chapter.</P><P>The English unitary authorities and shire districts may have up to
three councillors in each ward, and may hold elections either all at
once or by thirds. A few districts elect by halves every two years;
none of these districts held an election this year. Where districts
elect by thirds generally not all of the wards in the district hold an
election every year. Many of the shire districts and some unitary
authorities were using new ward boundaries, and so ward results will
not be directly comparable with previous years. A full explanation of
the electoral arrangements is given at the head of each council's
entry. </P><P>Unitary election results are shown in Part&#XA0;II, with one
exception,<SUP><A NAME="text1" HREF="#note1">1</A></SUP>
with shire district results in Part&#XA0;III. Part&#XA0;II is
divided into eight chapters based on region, while Part&#XA0;III has one
chapter for each county.</P><P>The Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly elections use a form of the
Additional Member System of proportional representation. In each
single-member constituencies are used (which, with one exception,<SUP><A NAME="text2" HREF="#note2">2</A></SUP>
are
coterminous with the UK parliamentary constituencies) with the country
also being divided into regions from which top-up seats are allocated
to restore a proportional balance of seats over the region. In
Scotland, there are eight regions electing seven regional MSPs each;
in Wales five regions with four regional AMs each. Welsh Assembly
results are in Part&#XA0;IV and Scottish
Parliament results are in Part&#XA0;V, with constituency and regional
results forming separate chapters.</P><P>All Scottish local authorities use first-past-the-post, with one
councillor elected from each ward. Elections to these authorities are
shown in Part&#XA0;VI. I have grouped the Scottish councils into eight
chapters based on geography: Aberdeenshire (Chapter&#XA0;54), Ayrshire
(Chapter&#XA0;55), Border (Chapter&#XA0;56), Clyde (Chapter&#XA0;57), Forth
(Chapter&#XA0;58), Highland (Chapter&#XA0;59), Island (Chapter&#XA0;60) and Tay
(Chapter&#XA0;61). Both the name and number of each ward are quoted
(except for Inverclyde Council, which does not name its wards).</P><P>Finally, at the back you will find an Index of Wards.</P><P>Where a candidate in an election dies, the election in that ward is
cancelled and rearranged for a later date. This happened in the
following wards at this election:
