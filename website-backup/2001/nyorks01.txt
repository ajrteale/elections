Note:  The low electorates in Fulford, Huntington North, 
Poppleton and Tadcaster East were due to the divisions losing 
territory when the City of York was expanded.
Out of a total of seventy-four divisions, the Conservatives won 
forty-one (up one), the Liberal Democrats seventeen (down two), 
Labour twelve (up one) and independents four (no change), 
meaning the Conservatives increase their majority on the council.
