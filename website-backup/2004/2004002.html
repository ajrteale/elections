<H1 CLASS="chapter">Introduction and Abbreviations</H1><P>Elections were held on 10th June 2004 to the European Parliament, the
Greater London Assembly, all metropolitan boroughs, some unitary
authorities and shire districts in England, and all local councils in
Wales. The day of polling was moved from the usual date in the first
week of May so that the local elections coincided with the European
elections.</P><P>This election was notable for the fact that, under a pilot scheme, in
four regions of England (the North East, Yorkshire, the North West and
the East Midlands) all the votes were cast as postal votes. The
scheme resulted in a significant increase in turnout in those areas.</P><P>The 78 British members of the European Parliament were elected in twelve
regions. The number of British MEPs had been reduced from 87 due to
the expansion of the European Union, which admitted 10 new members
earlier in the year. England was divided into nine regions, with
Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland forming the other three regions.
The MEPs in England, Wales and Scotland were elected using the list
system of proportional representation, while the three MEPs
representing Northern Ireland were elected using the Single
Transferable Vote system of proportional representation. In a move to
enfranchise Gibraltar, which despite being part of the EU had not
previously voted in a European election, the territory was included in
the South West region. The results of the European elections are
contained in Part&#XA0;I.</P><P>The Greater London Authority uses a range of voting systems. The Mayor
of London is elected using the Supplementary Vote system of voting, in
which voters give a first and second preference and, if no candidate
receives an absolute majority of first preferences, all candidates
except the top two are eliminated and their second preferences
redistributed between the two remaining candidates. The Assembly, by
contrast, is elected using a form of the Additional Member system of
proportional representation, with fourteen single-member
constituencies plus eleven &#X201C;London-wide&#X201D; members allocated to
restore a proportional balance of seats across Greater London. The
results of these elections are contained in Part&#XA0;II, with the three
sections of the contest forming separate chapters.</P><P>The voting system used for all other local government elections was
first-past-the-post, with multi-member FPTP being used where more than
one seat was up for election.</P><P>This year new ward boundaries were introduced in the 36 metropolitan
boroughs, and so, unusually, elections were held to all the seats on
these councils. Each ward has three councillors. Results of these
elections are contained in Part&#XA0;III, which each of the former
metropolitan counties constituting a separate chapter.</P><P>The English unitary authorities and shire districts may have up to
three councillors in each ward, and may hold elections either all at
once or by thirds. Only those councils which elect by thirds held
elections this year; those councils which elect all at once were
last elected in 2003 and will next be elected in 2007. A few
districts elect by halves every two years; all of these districts held
an election this year. Where districts elect by thirds generally not
all of the wards in the district hold an election every year. Some of
the shire districts and unitary authorities were using new ward
boundaries, and so unusually elections were held to all the seats on
these councils. A full explanation of the electoral arrangements is
given at the head of each council's entry. </P><P>Unitary election results are shown in Part&#XA0;IV, with shire district
results in Part&#XA0;V. Part&#XA0;IV is divided into eight chapters based on
region, while Part&#XA0;V has one chapter for each county.</P><P>The Welsh local councils hold elections all at once every four years,
although these elections had been delayed from 2003 so that the local
elections did not coincide with Welsh Assembly elections. Up to five
councillors can be elected from each ward. Elections to these
authorities are shown in Part&#XA0;VI.</P><P>Finally, at the back you will find an Index of Wards.</P><P>Where a candidate in an election dies, the election in that ward is
cancelled and rearranged for a later date. This happened in the
following wards at this election:</P><UL CLASS="itemize">
