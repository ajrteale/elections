Five by-elections this week, three in Dorset, one in Cornwall and one in Teesside.

KINSON NORTH, Bournemouth council, Dorset; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor David Turtle who is moving out of the UK.  He had served only since 2015.

For our first poll this week we are in Kinson, a former Dorset village which was annexed by Bournemouth in 1931, resulting in a change to what was then the county boundary between Dorset and Hampshire.  Kinson's North ward lies on the northern edge of the Bournemouth-Poole conurbation, with a large part of its acreage being the River Stour's floodplain.  Although the names of the remaining two Conservative councillors (Battistini and Angiolini) might suggest this is the Italian quarter of town, in fact only around 1.2% of its population is from the EU-14; the ward's census statistics are generally unremarkable although qualification rates are low and the population skews more towards the working-class end of the workforce.

Despite this, Kinson North was safe Lib Dem in the 2003 election, in which the Lib Dems performed well across Bournemouth generally.  From there it developed into a three-way marginal: the Lib Dems did well to hold all three seats in 2007 but narrowly lost out in 2011 to two Tories and a Labour candidate.  After that the Lib Dems gave up here, but the rise of UKIP meant this ward was still close in 2015 when the Tory slate had 33% and gained the Labour seat, the single UKIP candidate polled 27%, Labour 21% and a two-person Green slate 10%.  However, that's not the whole story of the 2015 election in this ward, because Bournemouth council messed up the poll by delivering Kinson North's ballot papers to Kinson South ward's polling stations and vice versa; that led to a court case which resulted in Kinson South's two Conservative councillors being unseated and having to stand again in a re-run last December.  No such court case was launched in respect of Kinson North (the election court being rather expensive) but the 2015 results here should nonetheless be treated with some caution.

Defending for the Tories is John Perkins, who was the losing Tory candidate in Kinson South in last year's void election; he works in the insurance sector.  The UKIP runner-up here in 2015 Duane Farr tries again; he was the UKIP candidate in the Kinson South rerun last December at which point his Twitter described him as an "NHS pain management volunteer".  The mind boggles.  Dennis Gritt, regular Labour candidate for the ward and councillor here from 2011 to 2015, shows, er, determination by trying again.  The Green Party candidate is Carla Gregory-May who is involved in her local school's Parents, Teachers and Friends Association.  Completing the ballot paper is Stephen Plant of the Lib Dems.

FERNDOWN, Dorset county council; and PARLEY, East Dorset council; both caused by the death of Conservative councillor John Wilson at the age of 74.  A retired engineer originally from Leeds, he had moved to Ferndown in the 1970s to join his family's motor business.  Wilson was first elected to Dorset county council in 2001 and was chairman from 2009 to 2016; he had served on East Dorset council since 2011.

Cross the River Stour from Kinson North along the A347 and you leave Bournemouth, entering the Parley ward of East Dorset council.  This is the village of West Parley, a Bournemouth commuter village on the road to, and now for all intents and purposes part of, Ferndown.  West Parley has grown dramatically since the Second World War; its Wikipedia page, at the time of writing, attributes this to "the Baby Boom from 1921 to 1951, this was when everyone was procreating tenfold due to welfare benefits and due to lower income jobs."  Steady on, there!  Many of those baby boomers have now retired to Parley, which is now in the top 100 wards in England and Wales for population over the age of 64 (35%) and in the top 20 wards in England and Wales for owner-occupation (94% of households).  Those among the ward's population who are still young enough to work give the workforce a middle-class profile.  Although this ward is only over the river from Kinson North, it's a world away socially.  These statistics are for the 2011 version of Parley ward; East Dorset was re-warded last year but Parley ward only had minor changes to its boundaries.

Parley is part of the wider Ferndown county division, a two-seat division covering Dorset's second-largest inland town (after Dorchester).  Ferndown is a mostly twentieth-century development - until 1972 its parish council was still known by its former name of Hampreston - and essentially functions as a dormitory town for the Bournemouth-Poole conurbation.

Parley ward is very safe Conservative with little of interest in its previous results; in 2015 (the only previous contest on these boundaries) the Tory slate beat UKIP 57-26.  Ferndown county division is a different matter, with UKIP gaining a seat off the Tories in the 2013 election; the UKIP slate topped the poll that year 45-44.  That result came as a surprise to UKIP's councillor Ian Smith, who didn't turn up for the count because he didn't think he would win.  That UKIP surge didn't follow through into the 2015 East Dorset elections; although boundary changes confuse the issue the Tories hold all the district seats wholly or partly within the division.

The future of local government in Dorset is up in the air at the moment, with a consultation under way on a number of proposed council mergers.  This makes the Ferndown county council by-election important not just for its marginality but as an indicator of what might happen in the future.  The Tory campaign is led by Steven Lugg, a former soldier, management accountant, live music fan, district councillor for Ferndown Central ward and Ferndown town councillor for Central North ward.  He is opposed by Peter Lucas, a Ferndown town councillor for Longham ward who was the losing UKIP candidate in the 2013 county election.  Also standing are Peter Stokes (who gives an address in Christchurch) for Labour and Jason Jones (from Corfe Mullen) for the Lib Dems.

Four candidates have come to Parley, but only one can win.  On previous form the Tories' Andrew Parry should be in pole position; he is opposed by Lawrence Wilson for UKIP, Brian Cropper for Labour and Jason Jones (again) for the Lib Dems.

FOUR LANES, Cornwall council; caused by the resignation of UKIP councillor Derek Elliott, who has become disillusioned by how the council is run.  He had served since 2013.

Moving to Cornwall for our fourth by-election of the week.  The Four Lanes division lies in the hills immediately to the south-west of Redruth: Four Lanes itself is a village on the Redruth-Helston road, over 700 feet above sea level.  While Four Lanes is relatively modern, the ward also includes Carn Brea, a Neolithic settlement on a hilltop west of Redruth: to the north of that is the village of Illogan Highway on the old A30 road.

The present Cornwall council has been through a dizzying series of boundary changes in its seven-year lifespan.  At its inaugural election in 2009 most of this area was in Carn Brea South ward, which returned a Lib Dem in a freak vote split with just 28% of the vote.  The Lib Dems didn't defend the successor division of Four Lanes in 2013, and a similar freak vote split elected UKIP's Derek Elliott, who also had 28% to 21% for the Tories, 20% for Labour and 17% for the continuing Liberal Party.  Going back before Cornwall's local government reorganisation in 2009 confuses the picture even more: this area was then a Labour stronghold, covered by the Carn Brea division of Cornwall county council and the Illogan South ward of Kerrier district council; despite the different names those units had the same boundaries.

Whatever you call this area - Illogan South, Carn Brea, Carn Brea South, Four Lanes - it's likely to produce another fractured result in this by-election.  Defending for UKIP, who have already lost four seats in Cornish by-elections since 2013 and will have just one seat left on the council if this one goes down the Swanee as well, is Dan Hall - and the fact that Hall gives an address fifteen miles away in St Ives doesn't give much indication that UKIP think they can hold here.  The Tory candidate is Peter Sheppard, a Carn Brea parish councillor.  The Labour candidate is Peter Williams, who gives an address in Falmouth; since there is already a Tory Peter Williams on Cornwall council a Labour gain here would give endless scope for confusion.  The continuing Liberals are not standing this time, so the ballot paper is completed by two more Carn Brea parish councillors - Christopher Lawrence for Mebyon Kernow and independent Bernard Webb - and Nathan Billings for the Lib Dems, who are on a hot streak in Cornwall at the moment with three by-election gains since April.

GRANGEFIELD, Stockton-on-Tees council, County Durham; caused by the death of Labour councillor Mike Clark at the age of 61.  A former journalist and NUJ father of the chapel at the Middlesbrough Evening Gazette, Clark had also been head of communications for Middlesbrough council before entering local government.  He had served since 2011.

To finish off this week we're in Teesside with a classic Tory/Labour marginal.  Grangefield ward is a socially mixed area in western Stockton-on-Tees; although the Grangefield area itself is slightly run down the ward also takes large bites into the more affluent suburbs of Fairfield and Hartburn.  At the centre of ward is the Grangefield Academy, a large new secondary school which is the successor to Stockton secondary school (whose former pupils included the first Labour speaker Lord Maybray-King) and Grangefield grammar school (which educated Ridley Scott).

Grangefield's two seats split equally between the Tories and Labour at the first election on the current boundaries in 2005, and the next two elections were also close (the Tories winning in 2007, Labour in 2011).  In the 2015 election Labour consolidated their lead over the Tories to 49-35.  Paradoxically the ward voted Tory in 2005 on the same day that Labour won the Stockton South constituency by 14 points, but Labour in 2015 on the same day the Tories won the Stockton South constituency by 10 points.

With any path for Labour back to power (assuming they are interested in wielding power at the moment) running through Stockton South, this a by-election to watch.  Mike Clark's widow Helen still sits on the council for Grangefield ward, and Labour are seeking to keep the ward's representation in the family by selecting his daughter Eleanor Clark, who runs an environmental project in the ward.  The Tories have reselected Stephen Richardson, who was runner-up here in the 2015 election and is fighting his second Stockton by-election of the year after contesting the neighbouring Parkfield and Oxbridge ward in January.  Completing the ballot paper are Daniel Dalton for UKIP and Nick Webb for the Lib Dems.
