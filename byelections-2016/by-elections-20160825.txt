THE LOCHS, Fife council; caused by the retirement at the age of 80 of independent councillor Willie Clark.  A veteran of Scottish local government, Clark was first elected in 1973 to the pre-reform Lochgelly district council; with local government reform in 1975 he stepped up to Fife regional council, transferring to the present Fife council on its establishment in 1995.  Although since the advent of party registration he had appeared on ballot papers as an independent, he was in fact a Communist, and was the last Communist to hold elected office in Great Britain.

Old parties never really die, they just fade away slowly.  Last week's by-election column made not one but two references to that Eighties throwback called the SDP, and it may surprise readers to learn that Britain was still electing an avowed Communist to office as recently as 2012.  Well, if anywhere was going to do that The Lochs ward was a good candidate: named after the Lochs Ore, Glow and Filty, this was the heartland of the Fife coalfield, a series of villages to the north of Dunfermline and Cowdenbeath.  The end of mining has led to depopulation in the area: Kelty, the ward's largest settlement, has seen its population fall from 9,000 to 6,000 over the last four decades despite its proximity to the M90 motorway making it attractive for Edinburgh commuters; not an advantage enjoyed by the Benarty area to the east (covering the villages of Ballingry, Lochore and associated settlements) which is classed as a "regeneration area" and suffers from high unemployment.

Willie Clarke's personal vote was massive: at the last first-past-the-post election to Fife council in 2003 he had 95% of the vote in Ballingry and Lochore ward, although that score was boosted because he was not opposed by Labour that year.  At the first PR Fife council election in 2007 Clarke was elected at the top of poll with 28%, with Labour (39% between two candidates) and the SNP (21%) winning the other two seats.  The 2007 election resulted in the SNP taking over Fife council in coalition with the Lib Dems, and in consequence the SNP vote fell back to 19% in the 2012 election with 46% for Labour and 28% for Clarke; that might have put the SNP seat in danger, but Labour failed to balance their candidates and the SNP held the final seat fairly comfortably.  One reason for the lack of Labour balance is that their ticket was headed by Alex Rowley, leader of the council from 1995 to 2007 who had remained leader of the Labour group in opposition.  Rowley returned to the council leadership in 2012 as Labour formed a minority administration on Fife council, but made the step up to Holyrood in 2014 by winning a by-election for the Cowdenbeath constituency (he was re-elected to the Parliament this year, but from the regional list after losing his constituency to the SNP).  After his election to Holyrood Rowley resigned from Fife council, and Labour held the resulting by-election on Euro-election day in 2014 in the first round, beating the SNP 62-25.  That was, of course, before the independence referendum and the political situation is rather different now.

Defending for the Communists - not a phrase your columnist has cause to write very often - is Thomas Kirby, the only candidate not to give an address in the ward (he lives in Methil, although he was Ballingry born and bred); he was the election agent for the Communists' North East Scotland candidate in this year's Holyrood election.  The Labour candidate is Mary Lockhart, a Yes campaigner in the Indyref and the candidate in last place on the Labour Mid Scotland and Fife list in May.  Lea McLelland of the SNP is described as a community activist; she has been prominent in a local campaign against cuts to bus services for the ward.  Completing the ballot paper are Malcolm McDonald for the Conservatives and Bradford Oliver for the Green Party.  Whoever wins this by-election will have to work fast to secure themselves a berth in next year's Fife council election, in which boundary changes are expected to result in this ward being abolished.
