This is supposed to August, this is supposed to be quiet.  Well, the local parties don't seem to have listened and 18th August sees nine council by-elections in England for a total of ten seats.  Two of these are in the north, with a Lib Dem defence in Teesside and an independent representing a ward which has been covered in this column very recently.  All the other by-elections are south of the Thames, with a crucial double by-election in Ramsgate for a ward which UKIP carried in their 2015 surge, and Labour defending two seats in Gravesend and one in South London.  But we start this week in Surrey with three Tory defences all in the town of Farnham.  You thought Surrey politics was boring?  Think again...


FARNHAM SOUTH, Surrey county council; and FARNHAM CASTLE, and FARNHAM SHORTHEATH AND BOUNDSTONE, Waverley council, Surrey; caused by the resignations of two Conservative councillors.  The first and third vacancies are caused by the resignation of David Munro, who was elected in May as Police and Crime Commissioner for Surrey; a former Royal Engineers officer who served in Northern Ireland and the Falklands, he had served on Surrey county council since 1996 and Waverley council since 2003.   The Castle ward vacancy is caused by the retirement of Paddy Blagden at the age of 86; Blagden, the father-in-law of the Canterbury MP Julian Brazier, was one of the few councillors notable enough to have his own Wikipedia page thanks to his work on de-mining, being head of the UN Mine Action Service from 1992 to 1995 and then in 1998 becoming a founder member of the Geneva International Centre for Humanitarian Demining.  Before his demining career Blagden spent 35 years as an officer in the Royal Engineers, retiring in 1988 with the rank of Brigadier; during his time in local government he served as Mayor of Farnham in 2013-14.

You wait years for the chance to write about a Farnham by-election and then three come along at once.  Farnham is possibly the archetypal Surrey commuter town, located close to the North Downs on the western border of Hampshire; the railway (now the Alton branch of South West Trains) came here in 1848, and the development of nearby Aldershot as an Army town secured Farnham's prosperity; it is the largest town within Waverley district, although the council is in fact basd in Godalming.  Much of Farnham South county division's housing stock is from a later, post-war, era, and its economic profile is middle-class with very high qualification rates.  The county division includes the ruins of Waverley Abbey, established in 1128 as Britain's first Cistercian abbey, which gives its name to one of England's more obscure local government districts.  Another ruin here is Farnham Castle, which saw action in the Civil Ward; for centuries the castle was home to the Bishops of Winchester - one of its famous residents was the fifteenth-century Cardinal Henry Beaufort who presided at the trial of Joan of Arc - and more recently it was the venue for the wedding of a South African exile called Thabo Mbeki, who would later go on to succeed Nelson Mandela as the country's president.  Farnham Castle gives its name to a ward which covers the town centre of Farnham together with the village of Dippenhall to the west.

On paper Farnham Castle looks the most interesting of these three by-elections.  It was a safe Lib Dem ward in 2003, in which year the Lib Dems gained majority control of Waverley council despite polling fewer votes than the Conservatives.  Since 2003 the Lib Dem organisation in Waverley has completely fallen apart (they were wiped out on the council in 2011 and haven't got back yet) and one of their two councillors sought re-election as an independent in 2007; the resultant vote split helped the Tories to win both seats in the ward.  The Conservatives increased their majority in 2011, but lost one seat in Farnham Castle in 2015 to a new party called Farnham Residents and Blagden only had a majority of 61 over a resurgent Liberal Democrats, although they only ran one candidate.  Shares of the vote in 2015 were 35% for Farnham Residents, 26% for the Tories and 24% for the Lib Dems.

Farnham Shortheath and Boundstone, a ward in the south of the town running along the A287 road towards Haslemere, has a slightly more straightforward history; it was narrowly Lib Dem in 2003 but a decisive Tory gain in 2007.  However, the Farnham Residents did well here in 2015 as well and gained one of the two Conservative seats, the Tories topping the poll 45-41.

The Farnham South county division, which survived Surrey's redistricting in 2013 unchanged, was a safe seat for Munro; at the most recent county election in 2013 he had 50% of the vote with UKIP and an independent tying for second place on 16%.

Defending the county seat for the Conservatives is Wyatt Ramsdale, a Waverley councillor representing the Farnham Wrecclesham and Rowledge ward.  The UKIP candidate is Paul Chapman, an engineering consultant in the oil and gas industry and chairman of the party's Surrey Heath branch - he gives an address in Frimley Green.  Mark Westcott, the independent candidate who tied for second in 2013, is standing again; he is an architect and landscape architect.  Also on the county ballot paper are Fabian Wood for Labour, Joanne Aylwin for the Lib Dems and Jerry Hyman, the leader of the Farnham Residents.

In Castle ward the defending Tory candidate is Nicholas le Gal, a student at Oxford Brookes University who works in the hospitality industry; he is the son of Denise le Gal, one of the two remaining Tory county councillors for Farnham.  Jerry Hyman is the Farnham Residents candidate, hoping to double up at both district and county level.  The Lib Dems have reselected Stewart Edge, the chairman of the party's Waverley branch and treasurer of the William Cobbett Society (Cobbett was from Farnham); he is hoping to return to Farnham council after serving for two terms in 1999-2007.  Completing the Castle ward ballot paper is UKIP's George Hesse.

Finally, Shortheath and Boundstone ward looks set to be a battle between two former Tory Waverley councillors who lost their seats to the Farnham Residents in 2015 - Donal O'Neill, formerly of Farnham Upper Hale ward, defends for the Conservatives, while the Farnham Residents have secured something of a coup by recruiting John Ward, Tory councillor for this ward from 2007 to 2015.  Also standing are Jim Burroughs for UKIP, Sylvia Jacobs (another former councillor for the ward) for the Lib Dems and independent candidate Andrew Jones.

NORTHWOOD, Thanet council, Kent; a double by-election caused by the resignations of councillors Konnor Collins and Helen Smith, who were elected as UKIP but had left the party. Collins and Smith have been charged with theft of gardening equipment from a local garden centre, while Smith also faces charges of assault and dangerous driving and Collins has faced questions over his claimed military service.  They had served since 2015.

Since it's August, it must be time for the seaside.  And so it is for the third time this year that this column finds itself in Thanet dealing with a UKIP defence.  Northwood ward lies in the north of the town, running from the railway station northward along the A254 Margate Road; like much of Ramsgate as a whole it has a working-class economic profile.

Thanet council was taken over by UKIP in the 2015 election, rather as a consolation prize following the failure of Nigel Farage to get into Parliament from the South Thanet constituency, which is based on Ramsgate.  UKIP did particularly well in Ramsgate that year mostly at the expense of Labour, for whom Northwood was previously a safe ward.  The 2011-15 Thanet council was both finely balanced and fissiparous: one of the Labour councillors for this ward in thaat term had a particularly dizzying series of defections, eventually ending up in the Green Party, but despite that Labour actually took control of the council partway through the term following a series of by-election losses by the ruling Tory group.  UKIP did very well in Northwood ward in the 2015 election, gaining all three seats with 46% to 29% for the Labour slate and 25% for the Tories, but the party have since lost their majority on Thanet council thanks to a five-strong splinter group walking off.  In addition, the Kippers have had to defend two by-elections in the neighouring Newington ward, after both their councillors resigned within a year, and one of the seats was lost back to Labour.

With the UKIP splinter group not defending these seats we have two open seats in a by-election with high stakes: two UKIP regains will put the Kippers back in majority control of Thanet council.  Their candidates are Lynda Piper and cafe-owner George Rusiecki.  Labour have selected Helen Crittenden, who recently returned from a four-year round-the-world trip in a Land Rover, and Kaz Peet, a DJ.  On the Tory slate are Charlie Leys, a University of Kent student, Broadstairs and St Peters town councillor and recent defector from UKIP, and Prince William lookalike Marc Rattigan.  Also standing are Grahame Birchall for his own Party for a United Thanet, John Finnegan and Jordan Williams on the Lib Dem slate, and independent candidate Colin Grostaste.  Some of the electors in this by-election will be thrilled to know that their polling station is a pub: the Windmill on Newington Road.
