This is supposed to August, this is supposed to be quiet.  Well, the local parties don't seem to have listened and 18th August sees nine council by-elections in England for a total of ten seats.  Two of these are or were in northern Yorkshire, with a Lib Dem defence in Teesside and an independent representing a ward which has been covered in this column very recently.  All the other by-elections are south of the Thames, with a crucial double by-election in Ramsgate for a ward which UKIP carried in their 2015 surge, and Labour defending two seats in Gravesend and one in South London.  But we start this week in Surrey with three Tory defences all in the town of Farnham.  You thought Surrey politics was boring?  Think again...


FARNHAM SOUTH, Surrey county council; and FARNHAM CASTLE, and FARNHAM SHORTHEATH AND BOUNDSTONE, Waverley council, Surrey; caused by the resignations of two Conservative councillors.  The first and third vacancies are caused by the resignation of David Munro, who was elected in May as Police and Crime Commissioner for Surrey; a former Royal Engineers officer who served in Northern Ireland and the Falklands, he had served on Surrey county council since 1996 and Waverley council since 2003.   The Castle ward vacancy is caused by the retirement of Paddy Blagden at the age of 86; Blagden, the father-in-law of the Canterbury MP Julian Brazier, was one of the few councillors notable enough to have his own Wikipedia page thanks to his work on de-mining, being head of the UN Mine Action Service from 1992 to 1995 and then in 1998 becoming a founder member of the Geneva International Centre for Humanitarian Demining.  Before his demining career Blagden spent 35 years as an officer in the Royal Engineers, retiring in 1988 with the rank of Brigadier; during his time in local government he served as Mayor of Farnham in 2013-14.

You wait years for the chance to write about a Farnham by-election and then, like buses, three come along at once.  Farnham is possibly the archetypal Surrey commuter town, located close to the North Downs on the western border of Hampshire; the railway (now the Alton branch of South West Trains) came here in 1848, and the development of nearby Aldershot as an Army town secured Farnham's prosperity; it is the largest town within Waverley district, although the council is in fact basd in Godalming.  Much of Farnham South county division's housing stock is from a later, post-war, era, and its economic profile is middle-class with very high qualification rates.  The county division includes the ruins of Waverley Abbey, established in 1128 as Britain's first Cistercian abbey, which gives its name to one of England's more obscure local government districts.  Another ruin here is Farnham Castle, which saw action in the Civil Ward; for centuries the castle was home to the Bishops of Winchester - one of its famous residents was the fifteenth-century Cardinal Henry Beaufort who presided at the trial of Joan of Arc - and more recently it was the venue for the wedding of a South African exile called Thabo Mbeki, who would later go on to succeed Nelson Mandela as the country's president.  Farnham Castle gives its name to a ward which covers the town centre of Farnham together with the village of Dippenhall to the west.

On paper Farnham Castle looks the most interesting of these three by-elections.  It was a safe Lib Dem ward in 2003, in which year the Lib Dems gained majority control of Waverley council despite polling fewer votes than the Conservatives.  Since 2003 the Lib Dem organisation in Waverley has completely fallen apart (they were wiped out on the council in 2011 and haven't got back yet) and one of their two councillors sought re-election as an independent in 2007; the resultant vote split helped the Tories to win both seats in the ward.  The Conservatives increased their majority in 2011, but lost one seat in Farnham Castle in 2015 to a new party called Farnham Residents and Blagden only had a majority of 61 over a resurgent Liberal Democrats, although they only ran one candidate.  Shares of the vote in 2015 were 35% for Farnham Residents, 26% for the Tories and 24% for the Lib Dems.

Farnham Shortheath and Boundstone, a ward in the south of the town running along the A287 road towards Haslemere, has a slightly more straightforward history; it was narrowly Lib Dem in 2003 but a decisive Tory gain in 2007.  However, the Farnham Residents did well here in 2015 as well and gained one of the two Conservative seats, the Tories topping the poll 45-41.

The Farnham South county division, which survived Surrey's redistricting in 2013 unchanged, was a safe seat for Munro; at the most recent county election in 2013 he had 50% of the vote with UKIP and an independent tying for second place on 16%.

Defending the county seat for the Conservatives is Wyatt Ramsdale, a Waverley councillor representing the Farnham Wrecclesham and Rowledge ward.  The UKIP candidate is Paul Chapman, an engineering consultant in the oil and gas industry and chairman of the party's Surrey Heath branch - he gives an address in Frimley Green.  Mark Westcott, the independent candidate who tied for second in 2013, is standing again; he is an architect and landscape architect.  Also on the county ballot paper are Fabian Wood for Labour, Joanne Aylwin for the Lib Dems and Jerry Hyman, the leader of the Farnham Residents.

In Castle ward the defending Tory candidate is Nicholas le Gal, a student at Oxford Brookes University who works in the hospitality industry; he is the son of Denise le Gal, one of the two remaining Tory county councillors for Farnham.  Jerry Hyman is the Farnham Residents candidate, hoping to double up at both district and county level.  The Lib Dems have reselected Stewart Edge, the chairman of the party's Waverley branch and treasurer of the William Cobbett Society (Cobbett was from Farnham); he is hoping to return to Farnham council after serving for two terms in 1999-2007.  Completing the Castle ward ballot paper is UKIP's George Hesse.

Finally, Shortheath and Boundstone ward looks set to be a battle between two former Tory Waverley councillors who lost their seats to the Farnham Residents in 2015 - Donal O'Neill, formerly of Farnham Upper Hale ward, defends for the Conservatives, while the Farnham Residents have secured something of a coup by recruiting John Ward, Tory councillor for this ward from 2007 to 2015.  Also standing are Jim Burroughs for UKIP, Sylvia Jacobs (another former councillor for the ward) for the Lib Dems and independent candidate Andrew Jones.

NORTHWOOD, Thanet council, Kent; a double by-election caused by the resignations of councillors Konnor Collins and Helen Smith, who were elected as UKIP but had left the party. Collins and Smith have been charged with theft of gardening equipment from a local garden centre, while Smith also faces charges of assault and dangerous driving and Collins has faced questions over his claimed military service.  They had served since 2015.

Since it's August, it must be time for the seaside.  And so it is for the third time this year that this column finds itself in Thanet dealing with a UKIP defence.  Northwood ward lies in the north of the town, running from the railway station northward along the A254 Margate Road; like much of Ramsgate as a whole it has a working-class economic profile.

Thanet council was taken over by UKIP in the 2015 election, rather as a consolation prize following the failure of Nigel Farage to get into Parliament from the South Thanet constituency, which is based on Ramsgate.  UKIP did particularly well in Ramsgate that year mostly at the expense of Labour, for whom Northwood was previously a safe ward.  The 2011-15 Thanet council was both finely balanced and fissiparous: one of the Labour councillors for this ward in thaat term had a particularly dizzying series of defections, eventually ending up in the Green Party, but despite that Labour actually took control of the council partway through the term following a series of by-election losses by the ruling Tory group.  UKIP did very well in Northwood ward in the 2015 election, gaining all three seats with 46% to 29% for the Labour slate and 25% for the Tories, but the party have since lost their majority on Thanet council thanks to a five-strong splinter group walking off.  In addition, the Kippers have had to defend two by-elections in the neighouring Newington ward, after both their councillors resigned within a year, and one of the seats was lost back to Labour.

With the UKIP splinter group not defending these seats we have two open seats in a by-election with high stakes: two UKIP regains will put the Kippers back in majority control of Thanet council.  Their candidates are Lynda Piper and cafe-owner George Rusiecki.  Labour have selected Helen Crittenden, who recently returned from a four-year round-the-world trip in a Land Rover, and Kaz Peet, a DJ.  On the Tory slate are Charlie Leys, a University of Kent student, Broadstairs and St Peters town councillor and recent defector from UKIP, and Prince William lookalike Marc Rattigan.  Also standing are Grahame Birchall for his own Party for a United Thanet, John Finnegan and Jordan Williams on the Lib Dem slate, and independent candidate Colin Grostaste.  Some of the electors in this by-election will be thrilled to know that their polling station is a pub: the Windmill on Newington Road.

GRAVESHAM EAST, Kent county council; and PELHAM, Gravesham council, Kent; both caused by the death of Labour councillor Jane Cribbon at the age of 66.  Originally from Dublin, Cribbon had served on Gravesham council since 1999 and was chair of the planning committee; she was first elected to Kent county council in 2005, lost her seat in 2009 and returned in 2013.

For our second and third Kent by-elections of the week we catch the train along the north coast of Kent from Ramsgate to Gravesend.  An old maritime town on the Thames estuary, Gravesend is still important to navigation thanks to being the base of the Port of London's pilots, who are much in demand as ships manoeuvre into Tilbury docks on the opposite side of the river.  Those with long memories who remember the 1952 film The Long Memory, in which John Mills lived in a fishing boat here, may be relieved to know that the town has been substiantially redeveloped since then; the Christianfields council estate has been completely rebuilt since 2007 and the town's railway station has recently followed suit, with a third platform appearing over Christmas 2013.  The railway station and waterfront lie at the heart of the district council's Pelham ward, which is not part of the Gravesham East county division which covers the eastern two-thirds of the town.

The Gravesham parliamentary constituency has a reputation as a bellwether, having voted for the winning party at every election since World War One with the exceptions of 1929, 1951 and 2005.  The Gravesham East division, which returns two members to Kent county council, is similarly marginal: it was Labour by 4.5 points in 2005 when Cribbon had one of the largest mandates in UK local government history, topping the poll with over 7,000 votes, before becoming fairly safe Tory in the Labour nadir of 2009.  It became obvious leading up to the 2013 county elections that Labour would regain the division, and one of the Tory county councillors actually did the chicken run before the 2013 county elections, winning a by-election for the neighbouring safe division of Gravesham Rural just before Christmas 2012.  Labour did indeed regain in 2013 with 36%, to 28% for the Tories and 23% for UKIP.  Pelham ward, by contrast, is safe Labour; in 2015 Labour, the Tories and the Greens took the Pelham 1-2-3 with 50%, 35% and 15% respectively.

Defending Gravesham East for Labour is Lyn Milner, a veteran district councillor representing Riverside ward.  As if there weren't enough Kentish marshes in the division already, the ballot paper provides us with two more, Diane Marsh (a former district councillor and defector from UKIP) for the Tories and Mark Marsh for the Lib Dems.  The official UKIP candidate is Tina Brooker, a legal secretary and pro-streetlight campaigner.  Completing the ballot paper is Martin Wilson for the Green Party.

In Pelham the defending Labour candidate is Jenny Wallace, a letting agent from Higham.  The Tories' Conrad Broadley is hoping to return to the district council after losing his seat in Singlewell ward in 2011.  Also standing are Marna Gilligan for the Greens, Emma Foreman fo the English Democrats, Gary Harding for UKIP and Sharan Virk for the Lib Dems.

TOOTING, Wandsworth council, South London; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Ben Johnson who is taking up a new post in City Hall as a senior adviser to the Mayor of London Sadiq Khan.  He had served since 2010.

The electors of Tooting must be getting a bit sick of this, as this is the fourth time in four months they have been called out to the polls following the GLA election in May and the parliamentary by-election and EU referendum in June.  The Tooting ward lies generally west of the A24 Stane Street/Tooting High Road taking in Streatham Cemetery and St George's Hospital; St George's is a teaching hospital, part of the University of London, and as a result the ward's demographics are skewed by a large number of students living in the area, most of whom will not be around in August.  Famous students and staff to have come out of St George's include the vaccination pioneer Edward Jenner, the mathematician and Egyptologist Thomas Young, the new Tooting MP Rosina Allin-Khan, the ill-fitting-white-shirt-wearer Harry Hill and the ill-fitting-white-suit-wearer and Olympics obsessive Paul Sinha.  Tooting Broadway underground station, on the Northern Line, links the ward to central London.

If Tooting's demographics are skewed by the presence in the ward of St George's Hospital, Tooting's local election results are skewed by the presence in the ward of both Wandsworth council, with its unbelievably-low-council-tax policies boosting the Tory vote, and Sadiq Khan whose personal vote boosts the Labour total.  Khan represented this ward on the Labour slate fom 1994 to 2006, when he stood down from Wandsworth council having made the step up to Parliament the previous year; that year the Tories gained two of the three seats in Tooting ward, but Labour recovered them in 2010.  The differences I'm talking about can be seen in the most recent Wandsworth council and GLA results: in the 2014 council elections Labour won with 45% to 28% for the Conservatives and 11% for the Green Party, while in the GLA elections last May Khan had a whopping 67-20 lead over Zac Goldsmith, greatly outperforming the London Members ballot where Labour led the Tories 57-19.  The true strength for the Tories and Labour probably lies somewhere in between these two sets of elections.

Defending for Labour is Paul White, who works in IT.  The Tories have selected Thom Norman, a PR man.  The Green Party candidate is Roy Vickery, a botanist and former Natural History Museum curator.  Also standing are Eileen Arms for the Lib Dems and Alexander Balkan for the SDP - not the last time this week that this column will be discussing that particular blast from the past.  Sadly, there is no Tooting Popular Front candidate.

ORMESBY, Redcar and Cleveland council, North Yorkshire; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Ann Wilson on health grounds.  She had served since winning a by-election in December 2009.

We move north for the first of this week's two North Yorkshire by-elections, although it might be a little controversial these days to describe Ormesby as North Yorkshire.  The Ormesby ward covers affluent suburbia on the edge of Middlesbrough; its most notable building is Ormesby Hall, a Palladian mansion house which was formerly the home of the Pennyman family and is now a National Trust property.  Also within the ward is part of Nunthorpe, a planned suburb built around Nunthorpe railway station by Sir Arthur Dorman for workers at his Dorman Long steelworks.

Ormesby is the only Lib Dem defence this week and on the basis of past form they are unlikely to face a serious challenge.  In 2015 the Lib Dem slate had 42% to 21% for Labour and 19% for a single UKIP candidate.

Defending for the Lib Dems is Carole Morgan, who gives an address in Nunthorpe.  Labour have selected Alison Suthers, their second lettting agent candidate of the week, from Newton under Roseberry.  UKIP have reselected their 2015 candidate Ian Neil, who also stood for the Middlesbrough parliamentary seat that year.  Completing the ballot paper are Cameron Brown for the Conservatives and Philip Lockey for the North East Party.

CATTERICK, Richmondshire council, North Yorkshire; caused by the death of Independent councillor Tony Pelton at the age of 77.  Pelton was one of Richmondshire's longest-serving councillors, having been first elected in 1995 under the SDP label; he stood down from the council in 2007 but returned in 2011 as an independent.  Away from politics he ran a bookshop in Richmond.

Catterick might not be the oldest village in England, but it bears one of the oldest names: Katouraktonion, a location in Britannia, appears on Ptolemy's map of the world identifying the twenty-fourth clime in the latitude system he was using.  At the time the Romans had a fort at the meeting point of the Great North Road, Dere Street and the River Swale which they called Cataractonium.  Around AD 598, as described in Aneurin's Welsh-language poem Y Gododdin, the native Britons were routed and massacred by the invading Angles in the Battle of Catraeth, a location which is generally considered to be Catterick.  In more modern times Catterick's location on the Great North Road meant that its economy has traditionally been based on coaching; an A1 bypass for the town was opened in 1959 by Lord Chesham at a cost of £1 million, and is now being rebuilt as a motorway for rather more money than that.  However, the main drivers for the town today are tourism, the local racecourse (which is just outside the ward boundary), and the military; Catterick airfield was one of the very first RAF bases, opened in 1914 by the Royal Flying Corps as a training centre (after the Second World War it was the RAF Regiment's training base), and is now run by the Army as Marne Barracks, part of the large Catterick Garrison complex.

Pelton's large personal vote in Catterick meant that he topped the poll in every election this century where he stood; in 2015 he had 44% of the vote to 40% for the Tory slate.  The Tory councillor elected for Catterick in 2015 died a few months afterwards, and the Tories held the by-election in February this year, beating an independent candidate 60-40.  The Tories safely hold the local county council division (Catterick Bridge).

The losing independent candidate in the February by-election, Jill McMullon, is now the defending candidate in this by-election rather than the challenger; she is a former Tory district councillor for Middleton Tyas ward (perhaps better known as Scotch Corner) who lost her seat last year.  Hoping to give Catterick a full Tory slate for the first time is Stephen Wyrill, a dairy farmer and national chairman of the Tenant Farmers Association.  Also standing are David Coates for the Lib Dems and Robbie Kelly (who gives an address some distance away in Arkengarthdale) for the Green Party.
