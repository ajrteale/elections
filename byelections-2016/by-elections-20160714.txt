Ten by-elections on 14th July 2016:

FOREST GATE NORTH, Newham council, North London; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Ellie Robinson, who has taken up a new post with the London Assembly as an advisor to Mayor Sadiq Khan.  She was first elected to Newham council in 2010.

It's worth saying a few things here to start this week's column.  June is normally a busy month for local by-elections, as vacancies from April and May are cleared before the summer holidays and we start to deal with what might be termed "collateral damage" from the May elections as councillors move on to bigger and better things which they have been newly elected to.  The Labour takeover of City Hall in May has led to quite a lot of such collateral damage, with two by-elections this week arising from councillors leaving to take up posts in Mayor Khan's administration and several more in the pipeline, including a by-election for the elected mayoralty of Hackney which will see an entire London borough go to the pools.  However, the EU referendum - with which no other poll could be combined, although the returning officer for Windsor and Maidenhead didn't get that message - has had the effect of pushing most of June's vacancies back into July where they are being compressed into a much shorter period before the summer holidays.  This means that your columnist has twenty wards to write about over this week and the next, so apologies to my readers (hello Sid, hello Doris) if there is less detail here than you might have come to expect.  Having said that, in the case of Forest Gate North your columnist is very grateful for help received this week from Tim Roll-Pickering, who is the election agent for the Conservative candidate.

So it is that we start the week in West Ham.  Forest Gate North is the part of Forest Gate lying to the north of the Great Eastern railway line, with Forest Gate station on the ward's southern boundary and Maryland station just off the south-western corner; wholly within the ward is Wanstead Park station on the Gospel Oak-Barking line, although that's currently closed for electrification works.  This is a long and thin ward running from west to east which has been left relatively untouched by the redevelopment seen in Stratford and the Royal Docks area; much of the housing is still Victorian, with the effect of wartime bombing still visible in many streets where replacement houses are in a different style to the original.  The "village" area at the eastern end of the ward, close to the heathland of Wanstead Flats, is gentrifying quickly, although that effect hasn't yet reached the centre of the ward or the Maryland area at the western end.  Nearly all of the ward is built up, although it does contain Forest Lane Park and West Ham Cemetery.

While the census statistics perhaps might not catch the full effect of the recent gentrification, they are very typical of Newham as a whole; the White British population is just 21%, with consequent very high scores for pretty much every other ethnic group.  The ward is in the top 100 in England and Wales for black population (25%), people born in the new EU states (11%) and those with non-UK qualifications (15%); the over-45 population is very low, 60% of households are rented in some way or another and there is also a significant student population.

The political complexion of the ward should be obvious from the word "Newham", where it's now ten years since anyone other than Labour won an election.  There's not much indication this is going to change in Forest Gate North, whose predecessor wards last failed to return a full Labour slate in the Tory landslide of 1968.  One of the past candidates who tried and failed to break the Labour monopoly was local resident Gerard Batten of UKIP, who finished last here in 2002 but has since gone on to greater things as an MEP for London (for how long, who knows?).  At the most recent borough elections in 2014 Labour had 58% of the vote, with the Greens best of the rest of 14% only just ahead of the Tories.  Sadiq Khan beat Zac Goldsmith here 65-15 in May, while in the London Members ballot the Greens ran second in the ward's ballot boxes with Labour winning 61-11.

So, not much for the Labour candidate Anamul Islam, who is described as a long-standing trade union and community activist, to worry about here.  The Greens, who will be looking to put down a marker in one of their best Newham wards, have selected conservation campaigner Elisabeth Whitebread.  Also standing are Conservative candidate John Oxley, a barrister working in family law, and the Lib Dems' James Rumsby who has withdrawn from the campaign for personal reasons but will still appear on the ballot paper.

BARNSBURY, Islington council, North London; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor James Murray, who has taken up a new post with the London Assembly as Deputy Mayor for Housing.  He was first elected in 2006.

Moving further into London, Barnsbury ward is stereotypical Islington running from the Angel at the southeast corner to the Caledonian Road and Barnsbury North London Line station at the northwest corner.  Barnsbury developed from the nineteenth century onwards as an escape from the overcrowded City and industrial Clerkenwell, and as the first staging post out of London on the Great North Road.  Wikipedia's list of famous Barnsbury residents reads like a rollcall of the great and good: Tony Blair, Benjamin Britten, Ian Holm, Walter Sickert, Simon Rattle, Grayson Perry.  Although Barnsbury's census statistics are overall similar to Forest Gate North, there are two major differences: the White British population here is still (just) over 50%, and 51% of the workforce have degrees with another 11% being full-time students - very much middle class.  The ward is in the top 100 in England and Wales for population born in the pre-2004 EU states (7.6%) and, interestingly, those who did not answer the census question on religion (16.2%).

The first Barnsbury ward election on the current boundaries in 2002 was safe Lib Dem, with Labour a long way behind in second; tied for the runner-up spot that year was human rights barrister and Labour candidate Emily Thornberry, who has since gone on to greater things as MP for the local Islington South and Finsbury constituency and (at the time of writing, this may have changed since) Shadow Foreign Secretary.  Labour did very well to gain all three seats in 2006 on a 14% swing, 22-year-old James Murray beating the alphabet to top the poll, and with the implosion of the Islington Lib Dems this has become a safe ward for them.  The Tories took over second place at the most recent borough elections in 2014, Labour winning 56-19; in May Sadiq Khan beat Zac Goldsmith here 55-22 while in the London Members ballot Labour had 47% to 18% for the Tories and 10% for the Greens.

Defending for Labour is Rowena Champion, a family law barrister.  Another barrister, Edward Waldegrave, is the Conservative candidate; also standing are physics teacher and former asylum-seeker Ernestas Jegorovas for the Green Party, Lib Dem candidate Bradley Hillier-Smith and independent Robert Capper.
