Ten by-elections on 14th July 2016:

FOREST GATE NORTH, Newham council, North London; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Ellie Robinson, who has taken up a new post with the London Assembly as an advisor to Mayor Sadiq Khan.  She was first elected to Newham council in 2010.

It's worth saying a few things here to start this week's column.  June is normally a busy month for local by-elections, as vacancies from April and May are cleared before the summer holidays and we start to deal with what might be termed "collateral damage" from the May elections as councillors move on to bigger and better things which they have been newly elected to.  The Labour takeover of City Hall in May has led to quite a lot of such collateral damage, with two by-elections this week arising from councillors leaving to take up posts in Mayor Khan's administration and several more in the pipeline, including a by-election for the elected mayoralty of Hackney which will see an entire London borough go to the polls.  However, this year the EU referendum - with which no other poll could be combined, although the returning officer for Windsor and Maidenhead didn't get that message - has had the effect of pushing most of June's vacancies back into July where they are being compressed into a much shorter period before the summer holidays.  This means that your columnist has twenty wards to write about over this week and the next, so apologies to my readers (hello Sid, hello Doris) if there is less detail here and next week than you might have come to expect.  Having said that, in the case of Forest Gate North your columnist is very grateful for help received this week from Tim Roll-Pickering, who is the election agent for the Conservative candidate.

So it is that we start the week in West Ham.  Forest Gate North is the part of Forest Gate lying to the north of the Great Eastern railway line, with Forest Gate station on the ward's southern boundary and Maryland station just off the south-western corner; wholly within the ward is Wanstead Park station on the Gospel Oak-Barking line, although that's currently closed for electrification works.  This is a long and thin ward running from west to east which has been left relatively untouched by the redevelopment seen in Stratford and the Royal Docks area; much of the housing is still Victorian, with the effect of wartime bombing still visible in many streets where replacement houses are in a different style to the original.  The "village" area at the eastern end of the ward, close to the heathland of Wanstead Flats, is gentrifying quickly, although that effect hasn't yet reached the centre of the ward or the Maryland area at the western end.  Nearly all of the ward is built up, although it does contain Forest Lane Park and West Ham Cemetery.

While the census statistics perhaps might not catch the full effect of the recent gentrification, they are very typical of Newham as a whole; the White British population is just 21%, with consequent very high scores for pretty much every other ethnic group.  The ward is in the top 100 in England and Wales for black population (25%), people born in the new EU states (11%) and those with non-UK qualifications (15%); the over-45 population is very low, 60% of households are rented in some way or another and there is also a significant student population.

The political complexion of the ward should be obvious from the word "Newham", where it's now ten years since anyone other than Labour won an election.  There's not much indication this is going to change in Forest Gate North, whose predecessor wards last failed to return a full Labour slate in the Tory landslide of 1968.  One of the past candidates who tried and failed to break the Labour monopoly was local resident Gerard Batten of UKIP, who finished last here in 2002 but has since gone on to greater things as an MEP for London (for how long, who knows?).  At the most recent borough elections in 2014 Labour had 58% of the vote, with the Greens best of the rest on 14% only just ahead of the Tories.  Sadiq Khan beat Zac Goldsmith here 65-15 in May, while in the London Members ballot the Greens ran second in the ward's ballot boxes with Labour winning 61-11.

So, not much for the Labour candidate Anamul Islam, who is described as a long-standing trade union and community activist, to worry about here.  The Greens, who will be looking to put down a marker in one of their best Newham wards, have selected conservation campaigner Elisabeth Whitebread.  Also standing are Conservative candidate John Oxley, a barrister working in family law, and the Lib Dems' James Rumsby who has withdrawn from the campaign for personal reasons but will still appear on the ballot paper.

BARNSBURY, Islington council, North London; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor James Murray, who has taken up a new post with the London Assembly as Deputy Mayor for Housing.  He was first elected in 2006.

Moving further into London, Barnsbury ward is stereotypical Islington running from the Angel at the southeast corner to the Caledonian Road and Barnsbury North London Line station at the northwest corner.  Barnsbury developed from the nineteenth century onwards as an escape from the overcrowded City and industrial Clerkenwell, and as the first staging post out of London on the Great North Road.  Wikipedia's list of famous Barnsbury residents reads like a rollcall of the great and good: Tony Blair, Benjamin Britten, Ian Holm, Walter Sickert, Simon Rattle, Grayson Perry.  Although Barnsbury's census statistics are overall similar to Forest Gate North, there are two major differences: the White British population here is still (just) over 50%, and 51% of the workforce have degrees with another 11% being full-time students - very much middle class.  The ward is in the top 100 in England and Wales for population born in the pre-2004 EU states (7.6%) and, interestingly, for those who did not answer the census question on religion (16.2%).

The first Barnsbury ward election on the current boundaries in 2002 was safe Lib Dem, with Labour a long way behind in second; tied for the runner-up spot that year was human rights barrister and Labour candidate Emily Thornberry, who has since gone on to greater things as MP for the local Islington South and Finsbury constituency and (at the time of writing, this may have changed since) Shadow Foreign Secretary.  Labour did very well to gain all three seats in 2006 on a 14% swing, 22-year-old James Murray beating the alphabet to top the poll, and with the implosion of the Islington Lib Dems this has become a safe ward for them.  The Tories took over second place at the most recent borough elections in 2014, Labour winning 56-19; in May Sadiq Khan beat Zac Goldsmith here 55-22 while in the London Members ballot Labour had 47% to 18% for the Tories and 10% for the Greens.

Defending for Labour is Rowena Champion, a family law barrister.  Another barrister, Edward Waldegrave, is the Conservative candidate; also standing are physics teacher and former asylum-seeker Ernestas Jegorovas for the Green Party, Lib Dem candidate Bradley Hillier-Smith and independent Robert Capper.

TROWBRIDGE GROVE, Wiltshire council; caused by the death of independent councillor Jeff Osborn at the age of 73.  Osborn started his career at fifteen by joining the Merchant Navy; in 1962 he enlisted in the Royal Engineers with whom he served in Germany, Cyprus and Aden, and with the SAS in Hereford.  He started his political career in the 1980s as a Labour figure and was their candidate in Somerton and Frome in the 1983 general election; after that he ended up in the Liberal Democrats, representing Trowbridge for twenty years initially on the former West Wiltshire district council.  Twice Mayor of Trowbridge and a long-serving member of Wiltshire council's health committee, Osborn left the Liberal Democrats over the coalition's health policy, and his final re-election was as an independent.  He leaves behind his wife Helen, also a Wiltshire councillor, and two daughters.

Moving out of London, we come to Trowbridge, the county town of Wiltshire and headquarters of Wiltshire county council.  Although Trowbridge is an old market town, its economy was traditionally based on textiles; in 1820 Trowbridge had over twenty factories producing woollen cloth, a similar level to several northern industrial towns.  Today the town's largest employers are the council and Apetito, a frozen food company.

The Grove ward covers south-western Trowbridge and has been the Osborns' personal fief for many years, both under its original guise (as the Trowbridge South West ward of West Wiltshire council) and now.  At the inaugural Wiltshire council election in 2009 Osborn (then a Lib Dem) beat the Tories 68-26; in 2013 as an independent he was not opposed by the Lib Dems and polled 86% in a straight fight with the Tories.  Wiltshire's district councils were abolished in 2009, so there's not much else to go on to give clues as to what might happen here without an Osborn on the ballot.

Defending for the independents is Robert Wall.  The Tories have selected David Halik, a town councillor and former Mayor of Trowbridge.  The Lib Dems have returned to the fray by selecting Chris Auckland, who works in social housing.  Also standing on a crowded ballot paper are Shaun Henley for Labour, Philip Randle for the Greens and UKIP's Simon Selby.

ASTLEY, North Norfolk council; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Steven Ward due to pressure of work.  He had served since May last year.

For the first of today's rural by-elections we're in Norfolk.  The Astley ward contains seven parishes, none of which are called Astley; instead the name commemorates the Astley family of Melton Constable Hall, an at-risk stately home regarded as the finest example of the Christopher Wren style.  Melton Constable itself was the most important settlement in the ward, being a junction of four railway lines and home to the main workshops for the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway; but the works closed in 1934 and thirty years later the railway was gone as well, and the loss of that work means that Melton Constable's population has halved since 1911.  Today Astley ward as a whole has a relatively old age profile and high levels of self-employment (17% of the workforce were self-employed in the 2011 census).

The ward has had a volatile recent political history, with the four ordinary elections since 2003 electing four different councillors.  Astley elected an independent in May 2003, but went Lib Dem in a by-election just two months later; the Lib Dems lost the ward to the Conservatives in 2011 and didn't stand in the 2015 election, in which the Tories beat the Green Party 56-26.  The ward is part of the Melton Constable county council division, which is just as volatile: Lib Dem in 2005, Tory gain in 2009, UKIP gain in 2013; the predecessor county division of Erpingham and Melton Constable was Labour-held from 1993 to 2001 in what was perhaps the last hurrah of Labour strength in agricultural Norfolk.

Defending for the Tories is Jo Copplestone, an artist.  The Greens have selected Mandy Huntridge who is the only candidate to give an address in the ward.  Callum Ringer is the Labour candidate, the Lib Dems return to the fray with Pierre Butifoker, and the UKIP county councillor David Ramsbotham completes the ballot paper.

BYRAM AND BROTHERTON, Selby council, North Yorkshire; caused by the death of Labour councillor Jack Crawford at the age of 69.  First elected in 1995 for the former Byram cum Sutton ward (although with broken service), Crawford had been chairman of Selby council in 2012-13.

Anybody who has travelled up the old A1 through Yorkshire has passed through this ward.  Generations of travellers will be familiar with Ferrybridge, the crossing point of the A1 and the M62 motorway, and its large power station.  On the other side of the power station, the River Aire and the county boundary is Brotherton, bypassed by the old A1, and its twin village of Byram cum Sutton; further up the Great North Road is Fairburn, once sliced in two by a busy dual carriageway but now enjoying some relief thanks to the completion of a motorway bypass for the area.  Just outside the ward boundary is Kellingley, home to the UK's last deep coal mine until its closure last Christmas; the presence of the now former coalfield gives this area a working-class economic profile.

Selby council got new ward boundaries in 2015 which makes comparison rather difficult; this new ward is a cut-down version of the former two-seat Fairburn with Brotherton ward, with Birkin and Burton Salmon parishes having moved out in the boundary changes.  Fairburn with Brotherton was a key Labour/Tory marginal, but the new ward appears to be better for Labour: in 2015 Crawford had 44% of the vote to 33% for the Conservatives and 23% for UKIP.  At county council level this ward is combined with better Tory territory to form the reliably Conservative Mid Selby division.

Defending for Labour is Steven Shaw-Wright, a former coalminer, Selby town councillor and present Mayor of Selby.  He is opposed by Bryn Sage, the Tory candidate, who runs a digital health company.  UKIP have not nominated a candidate, so the ballot paper is completed by Chris Whitwood of the regionalist movement Yorkshire First.

WIBSEY, Bradford council, West Yorkshire; caused by the death of Labour councillor Lynne Smith.  Smith had spent twenty years working in the voluntary sector with disabled people and also taught at university before being elected to Bradford council in 2006; in her council role she was chairman of the council's governance and audit committee.

Wibsey ward is the first part of Bradford that drivers see when they come off the M606 motorway.  A relatively late part of the West Yorkshire conurbation to develop, Wibsey was not incorporated into Bradford until 1899 and much of its housing stock is inter-war.  As well as Wibsey village, the ward also includes much of the Odsal area including the Richard Dunn sports centre, named after a local boxer who fought Muhammad Ali.

The red corner have held the upper hand in recent fights for the Wibsey ward title, with opposition to Labour in recent years coming from the populist right: the BNP took one of the three seats in 2004 but lost it back to Labour in 2006.  In 2012 UKIP took over as runners-up here; they were close in 2014 but Labour were well ahead in May's ordinary election, polling 47% to 21% for UKIP and 16% for the Conservatives.

Defending for Labour is Joanne Sharp, chair of the party's Wibsey branch.  UKIP's candidate is Jason Smith, chair of the party's Bradford branch who fought the ward in 2015.  The Tories have reselected their regular candidate for the ward Richard Sheard, who works for a software company.  Lib Dem candidate Angharad Griffiths completes the ballot paper.

NEWQUAY TREVIGLAS, and ST TEATH AND ST BREWARD, Cornwall council; caused respectively by the resignations of UKIP councillor Mark Hicks and independent councillor John Lugg.  Hicks, who had served since 2013, has resigned for personal reasons.  Lugg, who started his local government career over forty years ago and was first elected to the former North Corwall district council in 1979, is suffering from poor health.

There are two Cornish by-elections this week.  One comes in the village of St Columb Minor, once the major settlement in its area but now an eastern suburb of the seaside resort of Newquay; it is the major part of Newquay Treviglas division, whose name refers to Treviglas College, a secondary school and sixth-form college located just outside the village.

Further up the north coast is St Teath and St Breward division, which runs from the summit of Cornwall's highest point, Brown Willy, down to the sea, surrounding the town of Camelford on three sides.  The Brown Willy moorland is known for prehistoric remains and also for granite and china clay quarrying, while the divison's largest centre of population is the slate-quarrying village of Delabole, once the location of the world's deepest man-made pit and since 1991 home to the UK's first commercial onshore windfarm; Delabole's proximity to the Atlantic Ocean and high altitude (around 800 feet) made it a perfect site for a windfarm.

Newquay Treviglas was created for the inaugural 2009 Cornwall council election and was won in its first contest by independent candidate Harry Heywood, who had been Restormel district councillor for the Rialton ward which covered the area before 2007.  Heywood stood down in 2013 and his seat went to UKIP on a low share of the vote, 30% to 27% for the Conservatives, 25% for the Lib Dems and 18% for Labour.

St Teath and St Breward is another 2009 creation, surviving unchanged in the 2013 boundary review except for its name - the 2009 division with the same boundaries was simply called St Teath.  Before 2009 most of this area was in the Camelot ward of North Cornwall council, which Lugg represented as an independent with large vote shares; St Breward was in a ward with Blisland to the south which was Tory unopposed in 2003 but a Lib Dem gain in 2007.  Lugg's popularity has carried over to the unitary Cornwall council, and at his last re-election in 2013 he beat the Tories 65-35 in a straight fight.

So the previous form in both divisions doesn't really tell us all that much, although it says something of the disarray that Cornwall UKIP find themselves in that they have not found a candidate to defend Newquay Treviglas.  From winning six seats in 2013, this will be UKIP's fourth by-election loss in Cornwall since then and they have another seat to defend later this year.  With Newquay Treviglas up for grabs, the Tories have selected a strong candidate in Carl Leadbetter, the Mayor of Newquay who represents the ward on Newquay town council; he is a former hotelier and had served in the RAF.  The Lib Dem candidate is Paul Summers, a former town councillor who has recently retired after 36 years as a teacher.  Julian Grover is the Labour candidate.  Completing the ballot paper is George Edwards, a former Mayor of Newquay and former Restormel councillor for the town, who lost his seat on Cornwall council in 2013 - in those previous elections he was a Lib Dem, but he is now standing as an independent.

In St Teath no fewer than three independents have come forward to succeed Lugg.  Taking them alphabetically, Eddie Jones is a former chairman of St Teath parish council; William Kitto gives an address in St Teath; and Susan Theobald is a former clerk to St Teath parish council.  On the party political side of a crowded ballot paper, the Conservative candidate is Jeremy Stanford-Davis of St Teath; the Lib Dems' Dominic Fairman is a farmer who has diversified into camping and yurts; and the Labour candidate David Garrigan has resorted to crowdfunding websites to finance his campaign.

MARCHOG and Y FELINHELI, Gwynedd council; caused respectively by the resignations of independent councillor Chris O'Neal and Plaid Cymru councillor Siân Gwenllian.  O'Neal, who has served since 2012, resigned after pleading guilty to assaulting an employee of the taxi firm he formerly ran; he also spent part of last year in court being cleared of a blackmail charge.  Gwenllian was first elected in 2008, and is moving on to bigger things after being elected as Plaid Cymru AM for Arfon in this year's Senedd election.

North Wales is having a bumper crop of by-elections this month, with a poll in Llandudno last week and a third Gwynedd poll coming up next week.  Marchog division consists entirely of Maesgeirchen, a huge isolated 1930s-era council estate cut off from the city of Bangor by Bangor Mountain.  57% of the households are still socially rented - one of the top 40 figures in England and Wales - and the demographic indicators are as bad as you'd expect from an isolated council estate, with only 28% of the workforce in full-time employment and high scores in every other category for economic activity except "self-employed" and "retired".

Doing better is Y Felinheli, a village on the south bank of the Menai and historically a port; in 1825 a narrow-gauge railway opened connecting the village with the Dinorwic slate quarry in Llanberis, and readers of a certain age might know the village better under the name of Port Dinorwic.  During the Second World War Y Felinheli was a centre for building landing craft, and its harbour is still in use today for pleasure boating and sailing. The village's location midway between Bangor and Caernarfon means there is commuting to both towns, and a number of Bangor University students live here.

Gwenllian never faced a contested election in her eight years on Gwynedd council, having been unopposed in 2008 and 2012.  The last contested election in Y Felinheli was in 2004 with Labour narrowly beating an independent candidate.  Marchog's representation had a clearout in 2012, with the previous Labour and Independent councillors losing their seats to two new independent councillors.

Both by-elections are straight fights.  In Marchog the defending independent candidate Dylan Fernley is challenged by Labour's Luke Tugwell; both candidates give addresses on the estate.  In Y Felinheli the new Plaid candidate is Gareth Griffith, who is opposed by Bangor-based Conservative candidate Andrew Kinsman.
