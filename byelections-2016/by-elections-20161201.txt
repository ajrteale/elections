<h2>ARBROATH EAST AND LUNAN</h2>

Angus council; caused by the resignation of Independent councillor Bob Spink on health grounds.  He had served since 2003 after retiring from the family firm R R Spink and Sons, manufacturers of Arbroath smokies.

Monday by-elections don't come around very often, but this is the first of two Monday polls to Angus council in consecutive weeks, with Carnoustie on the bill next week.  Apparently the reason for this Monday poll was to take advantage of a school holiday in Angus today.

This week we are in the eastern of the two wards covering Arbroath, a mediaeval town developed at the mouth of the River Brothock around Arbroath Abbey, a late twelfth-century Tironensian foundation which is the final resting place of its founder, King William the Lion of Scots.  The Scottish Parliament met at Arbroath Abbey in 1320 and composed the Declaration of Arbroath, a letter written to Pope John XXII attempting to sort out a dispute which had seen King Robert the Bruce excommunicated and, along the way, asserting the independence of Scotland.  Following the dissolution of the Abbey Arbroath stagnated until the Industrial Revolution, when it became a major fishing port and textile centre, specialising in jute and sailcloth.  Much of that industry is now gone (although some fish are still landed here) and today many people from Arbroath commute to Dundee along the recently-dualled A92 road; the main local contributors to the economy are the military (45 Commando Royal Marines is based here), tourism and the notorious smokie.  Arbroath's football team, although only in the fourth tier of the Scottish league system, attained immortality in 1885 by thrashing Bon Accord by the record score of 36-0 in a Scottish Cup tie.

Arbroath's election results aren't so one-sided as that.  The Arbroath East and Lunan ward covers the eastern half of the the town together with a rural hinterland to the north and east as far as the hamlet of Lunan on its namesake bay.  Spink had first been elected in 2003 as an independent to the former Hayshead and Lunan ward, based on the hinterland, and was re-elected to this ward under PR in 2007 along with two SNP candidates and a Conservative.  There was no change to the party representation in 2012 with the SNP polling 44% of the first preferences, to 26% for Spink (who topped the poll) and 15% for the Conservatives.

Two independent candidates have come forward to succeed Spink.  Lois Speed describes herself as a "passionate believer in social inclusion, equality and fairness", while Kevin Smith is a former chairman of Arbroath community council and is used to pressure, having formerly been a deep sea diver and Royal Marine commando.  No doubt Smith is feeling even more pressure than he expected in this campaign, as his wife Julie is the Tory election agent.  The SNP will be hoping for a gain with their candidate Brenda Durno, a businesswoman who is hoping to follow her father, the late Alex Shand, onto Angus council.  The Tories - although their election agent might be a little torn on the matter - are hoping that businessman and property developer Derek Wann is the one to win here; he led the Better Together campaign in Angus in the independence referendum and was the Tory candidate for Angus in the 2015 Westminster election.  Completing the ballot paper are John Ruddy (of Montrose) for Labour and Richard Moore (a former York councillor now living in Forfar) for the Lib Dems.

By-elections on 1 December 2016:

RICHMOND PARK

House of Commons; caused by the resignation of Conservative PM Zac Goldsmith in order to seek re-election.  He had served since 2010.

We are cleared for takeoff in this by-election which Zac would dearly love you to think is all about Heathrow Airport.  Perhaps it's worth starting by discussing the airport, which it is proposed to build a third runway after decades of dithering over whether Heathrow, or Gatwick, or somewhere else in the generalised London area, should get a new runway.  This, it is argued, will better connect London with the rest of the UK and world and generate a net positive for the economy.

It's unarguable that Heathrow has no spare capacity.  The financial crash of 2008, despite depressing demand for airline travel around the world, made not a jot of difference to its arrival and departure list.  The major problems with expanding Heathrow are that its constrained site makes a third runway ruinously expensive without government help, and the position of its runways mean that takeoffs and landings have to occur with noisy planes at low levels over west and central London.  There's also the fact that public transport options for the airport are either ripoffs even by London standards (Heathrow Express, I'm looking at you) or timesinks.  Unfortunately the alternative options for expanding Heathrow tend to have poor connections by road or public transport, be in the wrong place for the rest of the country necessitating a time-consuming journey around London (Gatwick, I'm looking at you), or involve newbuild options which are prohibitively expensive (see the Maplin Sands proposal from the 1970s and the more recent kite of Boris Island).  Another obvious problem with closing Heathrow is that it would take the floor out of the economic base for much of west London; the ONS recognised the airport's importance in 2011 by making it the hub for a statistical Travel to Work Area.

For someone looking at this from 200 miles away, the main questions which come to mind are, firstly, if you're going to plan ahead for the future, why build only one new runway in the London area when surely building more than one would futureproof London even more against future demand; secondly, what sort of demand is it going to be?  There's a lot of talk about the third Heathrow runway attracting new transfer passengers from Scotland and the North of England, people like your columnist.  Your columnist, however, is used to the idea of flying from Manchester (which, incidentally, opened its second runway in 2001 and has plenty of spare capacity) to a transfer airport at Helsinki, Dusseldorf, Zurich, wherever is appropriate for an onward connection.  The problem with Heathrow trying to attract transfer passengers is, first, that Heathrow's landing charges price that option out of the market (a problem which the cost of building the third runway is going to exacerbate); second, that BA are not interested in UK regional destinations (possibly for that reason); and, finally, that decades of horror travel stories make some people want to avoid transferring in London at all costs.

Anyway, that's my view on the Heathrow question and presumably the electors of Richmond Park have theirs.  Richmond upon Thames, as a town, was founded by King Henry VII who built the long-gone Richmond Palace at a location which had previously been called Sheen; the name came from Henry's title as Earl of Richmond, itself derived from Richmond Castle in Yorkshire.  The area is still in favour with royalty - one of the electors in this by-election is Princess Alexandra - but its development is the usual London story of suburban development and eventual incorporation into Greater London.  

There has been a constituency based on Richmond, Surrey since 1918; its first MP was the couponned Conserative Clifford Edgar, who in that election soundly defeated the militant suffragette and independent candidate Norah Dacre Fox.  Edgar lost his seat in 1922 to Harry Becker, who had stood as an independent Conservative endorsed by Lord Rothermere's Anti-Waste League.  Becker was re-elected in 1923, this time as the official Conservative candidate, but stood down in 1924.  

Becker's replacement was the Australian Sir Newton Moore, who had been Premier of Western Australia from 1906 to 1910 before moving to London, and during the Great War had been GOC Australian Imperial Forces in the UK with the rank of major-general.  Moore had served in the Commons before - winning the St George's Hanover Square by-election in October 1918 before transferring to Islington North in the general election two months later, serving there until 1923.

Sir Newton Moore resigned from the Commons in 1932 shortly after being re-elected by the score of 85-15 in a straight fight with Labour.  His replacement was another knight of the realm, Sir William Ray who won the by-election unopposed.  Ray resigned in his turn in 1937 and the by-election was won by George Harvie-Watt, a barrister and TA figure who had previously been MP for Keighley from 1931 to 1935; Harvie-Watt easily defeated the Labour candidate George Rogers, a Wembley councillor and railway clerk who would go on to serve for 25 years as MP for Kensington North.

Harvie-Watt had a long career at the lowest rungs of government, immediately becoming PPS to the Board of Trade and serving as PPS to Winston Churchill during Churchill's wartime premiership; after the war he was appointed Baronet, became ADC to George VI and was kept on by Elizabeth II.  He eventually stood down from the Commons in 1959.

The 1959 election saw Harvie-Watt succeeded by another Tory figure, Anthony Royle, who had had the dubious distinction of losing the Torrington by-election to the Liberals the previous year.  A former army figure who had served in the Life Guards and the SAS before polio put paid to his military career, Royle was working as an insurance broker before entering politics.  Like Harvie-Watt, he had a long parliamentary career, peaking during the Heath administration in which was a junior Foreign Office minister.

In the 1970s Richmond suddenly became a marginal seat, falling to the Liberals in the 1973 Greater London Council election.  The GLC councillor, Stanley Rundle, was the Liberal candidate here in February 1974 and cut Royle's majority below nine points.  Rundle was replaced as Liberal candidate in the October election by Alan Watson, against whom Royle - who had been knighted between the two elections - increased his majority to just over ten points.  Another notable figure on the Richmond ballot that October was the barrister Bob Marshall-Andrews, who would later serve as Labour MP for Medway during the Blair and Brown years.  The 1979 election was a rematch between Sir Anthony Royle and Alan Watson, with Royle's majority down to its lowest level of six points; further down the ballot paper was a vestige of the short-lived political career of then pop mogul Jonathan King, who stood under his real name (Kenneth George King) and failed to break 1%.

The Richmond constituency was renamed Richmond and Barnes for the 1983 election, and got a new Tory candidate to match as Sir Anthony Royle retired.  Jeremy Hanley, a chartered accountant from an entertainment family - his parents were the actor Jimmy Hanley and the actress Dinah Sheridan, his sister was the former actress and Magpie presenter Jenny Henley - who had contested Lambeth Central in the 1978 by-election and the following year's general election, faced off against Alan Watson, fighting the seat for the third time but now under the Liberal/SDP Alliance label; the Labour candidate, some way behind, was Keith Vaz, who got into Parliament four years later for Leicester East and still represents that seat today.  In one of the closest results of the 1983 election, Hanley prevailed by 20,695 votes to 20,621, a majority of 74.  A rematch between Hanley and Watson in 1987 led to Hanley increasing his majority to 1,766 or four percentage points, and Hanley's lead went up again in the 1992 election in Richmond and Barnes, an election where all three major party candidates ended up in the Commons at some point; the Labour candidate was Don Touhig, who won the Islwyn by-election after Neil Kinnock's translation to Europe, and the Lib Dem candidate was Jenny Tonge.

By 1992 Hanley had joined the lower ranks of government as a junior Northern Ireland minister, and served in Major's cabinet as Conservative Party chairman for a year which was accident-prone even by the low standards of the Major administration.  As well as the collapse of Tory support, boundary changes - which had cut the number of seats in Richmond and Kingston boroughs from four to three - had merged his seat with part of Norman Lamont's Kingston constituency, leading to a new name for the constituency: Richmond Park.  In a repeat of 1992, Hanley faced off against Jenny Tonge, and this time lost by five points as the Conservatives lost the Richmond seat for the first time since its creation.

Tonge was born in Walsall and had trained as a doctor at UCL, and combined her medical career with being a Richmond upon Thames councillor from 1981 to 1990, chairing the social services committee.  She became the Lib Dems' international development spokeswoman, and was re-elected in 2001.  Her time on the party's front bench was cut short in 2004 when Charles Kennedy effectively sacked her as children's spokeswoman for making positive comments about Palestinian suicide bombers; she refused to apologise and, even since her translation to the Lords 2005, Tonge's loose tongue has continued to cause embarassment for the Liberal Democrats.

Upon Tonge's retirement from the Commons in 2005 the Liberal Democrats managed the rare feat of passing a seat on from one MP to another.  The new Lib Dem MP was Susan Kramer, who had stood for the party in the inaugural London Mayor election in 2000, polling 12%, and also fought Dulwich and West Norwood in the 1997 general election.  In office as a member of the largest Lib Dem parliamentary caucus, Kramer held a number of frontbench roles and campaigned against the expansion of Heathrow Airport.

The Tories had never given up in Richmond and for the 2010 election they selected through a newfangled "open primary" Zac Goldsmith as their candidate.  A former editor of The Ecologist magazine and a committed environmentalist, Goldsmith was from a long-standing political family: both his grandfathers had been Tory MPs (Frank Goldsmith representing Stowmarket from January 1910 to 1918 and Robin Vane-Tempest-Stewart, 8th Marquess of Londonderry, representing County Down from 1931 to 1945) while his father, the billionaire businessman Sir James Goldsmith, had been elected an MEP in France in 1994, served as leader of the European Parliament's eurosceptic group, and founded the short-lived Referendum Party to contest the 1997 election.  Goldsmith went on to defeat Kramer by seven points in the 2010 election, and in 2015 massively increased his majority to 58-19 over the new Lib Dem candidate, Robin Meltzer, who polled fewer than half the number of votes that Kramer had done.

The Lib Dem collapse in 2015 was presaged by the 2014 local elections.  In the eleven wards of Richmond and Kingston making up this seat the Conservatives polled 44% to just 23% for Lib Dems and 13% for the Greens, who contested every ward, and the Tories won 32 of the 33 council seats within the constituency to one for the Lib Dems.  The Tories held Tudor ward in a by-election in October 2014.

The London Assembly elections in 2016 aren't easy to compare, partly because postal votes are not broken down to ward level and partly because the Tory candidate for London mayor this year was none other than Zac Goldsmith, who ran a surprisingly right-wing campaign; for what it's worth, in on-the-day votes Goldsmith beat Sadiq Khan here 57-25 and the Tories carried Richmond Park on the list vote with 46%, to 19% for Labour and 12% for the Lib Dems.

These recent reverses haven't stopped the Lib Dems from attempting to crank their by-election machine to full throttle.  They are focusing on the most recent poll in the borough: the EU referendum in June, in which Richmond Park was a strongly pro-Remain area: Richmond borough as a whole was 69% Remain and Kingston borough 62% remain, and demographic-based estimates by Chris Hanretty have put the Remain vote across the constituency at 72%.  Goldsmith, on the other hand, was a Leave campaigner.

As stated, Zac Goldsmith is standing for re-election; he does not have the Tory nomination, but is standing as an independent without Conservative opposition and is also endorsed by UKIP.

The Lib Dem candidate is Sarah Olney, an accountant working at the National Physical Laboratory.  An oppoend of Heathrow expansion, she is endorsed by the Green Party and the Women's Equality Party.

Of the other parties who stood in 2015 only Labour are left standing: their candidate is Christian Wolmar, a journalist focusing on transport and railway issues who had also sought the Labour nomination for the London Mayor election.

Five candidates complete the ballot paper.  Regular by-election candidate and Monster Raving Loony Party leader Howling Laud Hope is back for his umpteenth attempt to get into Parliament.  The One Love party leader Ankit Love, standing under the pseudonym "Maharaja Jammu and Kashmir" is hoping to improve on the twenty on-the-day votes he polled here in May's London Mayor election.  Turning to the more serious wing, management consultant David Powell is standing as an independent candidate; the evangelical Chistian Peoples Alliance have nominated Dominic Stockford; and independent candidate Fiona Syms, estranged wife of Tory MP Robert Syms, is standing as an anti-Goldsmith spoiler candidate with a pledge to take the Conservative whip if she is elected.

Constituency polling in the UK has a poor track record, but one poll taken at the start of the campaign conducted by BMG Research for the London Evening Standard (which, for what it's worth, was strongly in favour of Goldsmith in the mayoral election) had Goldsmith on 56% to 29% for Olney and 11% for Labour.  It remains to be seen whether a month of campaigning has had any effect on these figures.  Whatever happens, remember that we are in the crazy year of 2016 and the only thing that can be confidently predicted is that all bets are off.

WALBROOK

City of London corporation; caused by the resignation of Independent councilman Lucy Frew.

Richmond Park isn't the only poll in London this week as there are two local by-elections.  One of them is to the Walbrook ward of the City of London Corporation, the financial centre of the UK.  Well, it has to be; this ward is centred on the Bank undergound station and includes the Mansion House, residence of the Lord Mayor of London, and the Bank of England.

The City Corporation is a hangover from local government in olden time, with one of the hangovers being plural voting: the 343 electors in this by-election are almost all sole traders or nominated by businesses within the ward rather than being local residents, because there are almost no local residents here.  The council has the non-partisan politics of a parish council and this by-election fits the mould with three independent candidates.  Peter Bennett, a chartered surveyor and Bridge Master of the City, would appear to be the City establishment candidate; he is opposed by Xuelin Bates, the wife of the former MP for Langbaurgh and Paymaster General in the Major government Lord Bates, and independent media consultant Sophia Morrell.

WHITECHAPEL

Tower Hamlets council, North London; caused by the disqualification of Shahed Ali who is now serving a five-month prison sentence for housing fraud.  

Whitechapel may only be a mile away from the Bank geographically, but politically and demographically it's another world entirely.  Entirely south of the Whitechapel Road and served by Aldgate East and Whitechapel underground stations, the modern ward does not include the sites of the Ripper murders but does have some more modern history: within the current boundaries are Cable Street, where the 1936 battle started, and Sydney Street, scene of the 1911 siege which failed to flush out Peter the Painter and is now commemorated by two modern-day blocks of flats called Siege House and Painter House.  Slightly more tasteful is the Whitechapel Bell Foundry, still in operation today, while major public buildings within the ward include the controversial PFI Royal London Hospital and the equally controversial East London Mosque.

While Whitechapel took its name from the former church of St Mary Matfelon, which didn't survive the wartime bombing, it was once a centre of the Jewish community and the predecessor St Mary's ward returned Communists to Tower Hamlets council as late as 1971.  Boundary changes confuse the issue slightly, but this is now a Bangladeshi centre - the former Whitechapel ward made the top 100 wards in England and Wales for Asian ethnicity (49.7%), those born in the EU-14 (8.0%), Islam (42.4%) and those who did not answer the census' religion question (17.0%).

Accordingly the ward tends to elect a full slate of Bangladeshi councillors, with Shahed Ali topping the poll in 2014.  Ali was first elected in 2006 as a candidate of George Galloway's Respect party, being re-elected in 2010 on the Labour ticket and in 2014 as a supporter of then Mayor Lutfur Rahman under the label "Tower Hamlets First".  He was named in the court case which removed Rahman from office, the court noting that Ali was registered to vote at two different addresses in Whitechapel ward and two votes were cast in his name in the 2014 election.  One of those addresses was a council property in Christian Street, Aldgate, and Ali had accepted that flat in 2009 without having disclosed to his own council that he also owned a string of other properties both within and outside the borough.

In 2014 - the only previous result on these boundaries - the Rahmanite slate had 40% of the vote to 26% for Labour and 13% for a single Green Party candidate.  The London Assembly results from May suggest that this is very safe Labour without a Rahmanite on the ballot paper: Sadiq Khan beat Zac Goldsmith 67-14 and in the London Members ballot Labour led the Tories 60-13.

With the dissolution of Rahman's Tower Hamlets First the defending Rahmanite candidate is Shafi Ahmed, standing as an independent.  Labour have selected Victoria Obaze, a Fabian member and secondary school governor from Mile End who has twice previously stood for the council.  The Greens hae selected local housing campaigner James Wilson, and the ballot paper is completed by Will Fletcher for the Tories, Emanuel Andjelic for the Lib Dems and Martin Smith for UKIP.

SOUTHBOURNE

Chichester district council, West Sussex; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Bruce Finch.  He had served since 2011.

Moving out of London, we are on the coast in the south-eastern corner of Sussex.  Southbourne is the place where the Portsmouth conurbation ends and Sussex begins, a village of a little over 6,000 souls; it is sufficiently close to the Hampshire boundary to have a Hampshire postcode (PO10, for Emsworth).  The ward also includes West Thorney, a Royal Artillery base on an island in Chichester Harbour, home to around 1,000 people and rather more seabirds, and once a transit post for Vietnamese refugees accepted into the UK in the 1980s.  Much of the ward is within the Chichester Harbour area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and the area has a commuter economic profile with high employment levels.

Southbourne ward's three seats split two Conservative and one Lib Dem in 2003 but the Tories gained a full slate in 2007 and have yet to relinquish it.  In the 2015 election the Tories prevailed 58-42 in a straight fight with the Lib Dems - a surprising candidate list because UKIP hold the local county council seat (Bourne).

Defending for the Tories is David Harwood, a private hire driver.  The Lib Dem candidate, and the only candidate to give an address in the ward, is Southbourne parish councillor Jonathan Brown.  Also standing are Rebecca Hamlet for Labour and Patricia Hunt for UKIP.
