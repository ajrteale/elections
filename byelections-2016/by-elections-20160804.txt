ALSTON MOOR, Eden council, Cumbria; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor David Hymers.  Hymers had served only since 2015; he held the economic development portfolio on Eden council but resigned after his business affairs were featured in Private Eye's Rotten Boroughs column.

Welcome to the High Pennines.  Alston vies with Buxton for the title of England's highest market town, lying in the valley of the South Tyne over 1,000 feet above sea level.  The town's economy was traditionally based on mining, with large deposits of lead, silver and coal in the area.  The nearby village of Nenthead, at over 1,500 feet, dates only from the mid-eighteenth century, built by the London Lead Company to serve the Nenthead mines and the UK's first village to have electric street lighting.  Tynehead, once another thriving mining village but now reduced to a single house, was once the location of England's highest primary school, while Garrigill lies on the Pennine Way at the end of the descent from its highest point, Cross Fell.  With the end of mining in the area (although there are thought to be significant zinc deposits below Nenthead) the population of Alston Moor parish, which includes all those villages and a large amount of moorland, has crashed from over 6,800 in 1831 to around 1,200 today, and Alston's Wikipedia page paints a picture of a town in serious decline: the town's last bank closed in 2015 and Channel 4 were in town in 2006 with a documentary examining a serious male-female imbalance in the local population.

That male-female imbalance doesn't extend to Alston Moor's two district councillors, who are gender-balanced.  Independent councillor Patricia Godwin was re-elected last year for a second term at the top of the poll, with new Conservative candidate Hymers narrowly beating an independent candidate for the other seat.  Alston is also represented by an independent on Cumbria county council (in Alston and East Fellside division).

Defending for the Tories is Stephen Harrison, a farmer who has diversified into holiday accommodation.  In a straight fight, he is opposed by the Liberal Democrat candidate Thomas Sheriff.
