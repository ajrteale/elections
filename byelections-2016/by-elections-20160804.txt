There are seven by-elections on 4th August 2016.  Let me take you on a trip from north to south, starting and finishing on the coast - for where better is there to be in August?  There are four Tory defences this week, two in marginal wards in the North of England (in one of which the outgoing councillor is rather under a cloud) and two safe seats in Nottinghamshire; Labour defend two urban seats, a three-way marginal in Ashford (Kent) and a safe seat in Brighton; and the final seat up this week is an open seat in Staffordshire which in recent years has been a Labour vs UKIP marginal.  Confused?  Let me explain...

SOUTH EAST HOLDERNESS, East Riding council, East Yorkshire; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Arthur Hodgson, who had served since 2007.

Mention the name John Smeaton and you might think of a former Glasgow Airport baggage handler, but there was another famous John Smeaton, an eighteenth-century civil engineer best known for the penultimate Eddystone lighthouse.  One of Smeaton's lighthouses can be found at Spurn Point, that narrow strip of sand-dunes which stretches halfway across the end of the Humber estuary; while the dunes have been knocked about a bit by recent weather events which have taken out the road, there is still a population at Spurn Point which is the base for one of the UK's very few paid full-time lifeboat crews.

Spurn may appear to be the end of land for those travelling on the North Sea ferries out of Hull, but of course it is the start of land for those arriving here from the continent: one of those was Henry of Bolingbroke, who landed at Ravenspurn to start his deposition of Richard II in 1399; Ravenspurn was a port here, long lost on this rapidly eroding coast.  Not that there are many people arriving in this ward from the continent today: the 2011 census found only 72 people here from the new EU states with South East Holderness' population being almost homogeneously British and to a large extent retired: perhaps one explanation for the large Leave vote across the East Riding in the recent referendum.  

With the demise beneath the waves of Ravenspurn, Ravenser Odd (once a more important port than Hull, sending a representative to the Model Parliament of 1295 but destroyed by the Grote Mandrenke storm in 1362) and around 30 other coastal settlements in Holderness, the ward's main centre of population is now Withernsea, a seaside resort at the northern landfall of the Greenwich meridian, known for the fact that its lighthouse lies inland in the middle of the town centre.  The East Riding's wards tend to be on the large side in both geographic and population terms, and Withernsea is one of thirteen parishes making up the South East Holderness ward.

The Tories have monopolised South East Holderness' three councillors at every election this century, but the ward is trending away from them: Labour and an independent both came close at a 2012 by-election, and UKIP performed well here in 2015 when the shares of the vote were 35% for the Tories, 30% for UKIP and 26% for the Labour slate.  Important news events over the last few weeks make googling for "Hodgson resignation" and expecting to be enlightened as to this by-election rather a fruitless exercise.

Defending this three-way marginal for the Conservatives, and in the unusual position for a T of the top half of the ballot paper, is David Tucker, an electrical projects director from Easington, the nearest village to Spurn.  UKIP have selected Andrew Weaver, a logistics manager and former coalminer who fought his home ward (Mid Holderness) last year.  Labour's Patrick Wilkinson, despite not having yet reached his 19th birthday, already has a track record as an election winner having being returned to Withernsea town council in a by-election last November at the age of 18 years 43 days.  Also standing are Withernsea-based independent Dave Edwards, who hasn't been put off by his last-place finish here last year, and Lib Dem candidate Helen Wright.

ALSTON MOOR, Eden council, Cumbria; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor David Hymers.  Hymers had served only since 2015; he held the economic development portfolio on Eden council but resigned after his business affairs were featured in Private Eye's Rotten Boroughs column.

From the Holderness coast to the High Pennines.  Alston vies with Buxton for the title of England's highest market town, lying in the valley of the South Tyne over 1,000 feet above sea level.  The town's economy was traditionally based on mining, with large deposits of lead, silver and coal in the area.  The nearby village of Nenthead, at over 1,500 feet, dates only from the mid-eighteenth century, built by the London Lead Company to serve the Nenthead mines and the UK's first village to have electric street lighting; we retain the connection with John Smeaton, who worked on the drainage in the Nenthead mines.  Tynehead, once another thriving mining village but now reduced to a single house, was once the location of England's highest primary school, while Garrigill lies on the Pennine Way at the end of the descent from its highest point, Cross Fell.  With the end of mining in the area (although there are thought to be significant zinc deposits below Nenthead) the population of Alston Moor parish, which includes the town, all those villages and a large amount of moorland, has crashed from over 6,800 in 1831 to around 1,200 today, and Alston's Wikipedia page paints a picture of a town in serious decline: the town's last bank closed in 2015 and Channel 4 were in town in 2006 with a documentary examining a serious male-female imbalance in the local population.  Tourism, farming and metalworking are now the main local employers; self-employment rates in the ward are high and there is a relatively old age profile.

The male-female imbalance doesn't extend to Alston Moor's two district councillors, who are gender-balanced.  Independent councillor Patricia Godwin was re-elected last year for a second term at the top of the poll, with new Conservative candidate Hymers narrowly beating an independent candidate for the other seat.  Alston is represented by an independent on Cumbria county council (in Alston and East Fellside division).

Defending for the Tories is Stephen Harrison, a farmer who has diversified into holiday accommodation.  In a straight fight, he is opposed by the Liberal Democrat candidate Thomas Sheriff.

SILVERDALE AND PARKSITE, Newcastle-under-Lyme council, Staffordshire; caused by the death of councillor Eileen Braithwaite who had been elected as UKIP but had left the party.

More mining up in the hills as we come to the first of this week's three repeats - wards which readers will long memories (hello Sid, hello Doris) will have seen in this column before.  Silverdale Colliery, in the range of hills that runs west from Stoke-on-Trent, was greatly expanded in the 1970s and closed as late as 1998; it was Staffordshire's last deep coal mine.  Its legacy can still be seen in the ward's working-class demographic, with 35% of the workforce having no qualifications (although a further 7% are studying for one, being students at the nearby Keele University).

Newcastle-under-Lyme is rather unusual in that it was electing UKIP councillors long before electing UKIP councillors became fashionable.  Braithwaite herself was first elected in 2003 under the label of the "Caring Party", gaining what had previously been a safe Labour seat by 12 votes; the Caring Party then folded into UKIP and Braithwaite was re-elected in the 2007 election which also saw the Kippers gain Silverdale's other council ward (Knutton and Silverdale).  Braithwaite lost her seat in 2011 but got back on the council in 2014, only for the UKIP group to suffer a damaging split (now where have we heard that before?) in which she and two other Kipper councillors walked off to become independents.  The split happened before the most recent election in this ward in 2015 which thus had no UKIP candidate; Labour won with 47% to 23% for Eileen's husband Richard, standing as an independent, and 22% for the Conservatives.  UKIP held the local county council seat by two votes over Labour in 2013, although the county councillor is also one of the splitters; the county division includes Keele University, demonstrating once again that students don't vote in local elections.

Defending for the independents is Gary White, vice-chairman of Madeley parish council (a couple of miles to the west) and partner of independent councillor for Madeley Simon White.  UKIP want their seat back, and have selected Lynn Dean.  Labour also want their seat back, and have selected Gareth Snell, a former leader of the council who lost his seat in 2014.  Completing the ballot paper is James Vernon of the Conservatives, who stood here in a 3013 by-election and in 2014.

BINGHAM, Nottinghamshire county council; and CRANMER, Rushcliffe council, Nottinghamshire; both caused by the death of Conservative councillor Martin Suthers.  A contemporary of Ken Clarke, Norman Fowler and John Gummer in the Cambridge University Conservative association, Suthers had a long career in local government, being first elected in 1967 to the pre-reform Nottingham city council: he fought Nottingham West in the 1970 general election and was Lord Mayor of Nottingham in 1988-89.  During his mayoral year he was appointed OBE for political and public services.  He was first elected to Nottinghamshire county council in a 2000 by-election, serving as deputy leader of the council from 2009 to 2013 and as deputy leader of the Conservative group since 2013.  He was in his first term on Rushcliffe council, having been elected for Cranmer ward in 2015.

From the West to the East Midlands for the safest Tory defences of the week.  Bingham is an old Roman town at the junction of the Fosse Way and the Nottingham-Grantham road, which has grown rapidly in recent years thanks to Nottingham overspill and commuting.  Despite this growth, Bingham isn't large enough to have a county division all to itself, and to make the numbers up the Bingham county division includes a series of villages in the Vale of Belvoir along the Nottingham-Grantham railway line, of which the largest is Aslockton.  Aslockton forms the focus of a district ward named in honour of its most famous son Thomas Cranmer, the Archbishop of Canterbury during the reign of Edward VI, compiler of the first two editions of the Book of Common Prayer and a martyr to the cause of the English Reformation.  Further east in the county division is the village of Thoroton, where the former Lord Chancellor, Lord Falconer of Thoroton, owns property.

Suthers held safe county and district seats; in the 2013 county election he had 42% in Bingham to 20% each for Labour and the Lib Dems and 18% for UKIP, while in Cranmer ward in 2015 (the first contest on the ward's current boundaries) he beat Labour 71-29 in a straight fight.

It's a family affair for the two defending Tory candidates: defending the Bingham county division for the Tories is Bingham West district councillor Francis Purdue-Horan, whom the Tories have forgiven for a widely-reported gaffe during his year as Mayor of Rushcliffe in 2015-16 in which he dedicated the Queen song Fat Bottomed Girls to "all the girls of Bingham"; while Purdue-Horan's wife Maureen Stockwood, a former Mayor of both Bingham and Rushcliffe, is defending the Cranmer district ward after losing her seat in the 2015 district elections.  Labour once put up a candidate in Cranmer ward called Rupert Bear (since you asked, a retired divorce lawyer who once worked for the same Nottingham law firm as Suthers) but for that by-election they have reselected their 2015 district candidate Chris Grocock, while the county by-election will be fought for Labour by Alan Walker.  Completing both ballot papers is the 2015-16 Mayor of Bingham Tracey Kerry, standing as an independent.

BEAVER, Ashford council, Kent; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Jill Britcher, who is moving away from the borough.  She had served since winning a by-election in February 2013.

From one Belvoir to another: the Beaver ward of Ashford, the second of this week's three repeats.  One of the boom towns of modern Britain thanks to its location and good transport links, Ashford is an old market town which became a major railway junction in the nineteenth century.  It is now linked to London and (subject to French security checks) the Channel Ports by the M20 motorway and the Channel Tunnel Rail Link, with high-speed trains taking just 37 minutes to reach St Pancras.  The growth of Ashford has meant the town has spilled outside its old boundaries to swallow up several surrounding villages, and Beaver ward (named after Beaver Lane), which was originally the south-west corner of the town, is now just part of the urban sprawl.

Beaver ward is a fairly working-class area and was safe Labour in 2003. Unusually it swung towards the Conservatives at the next two ordinary elections.  In May 2011 the two Labour candidates were just 29 and 27 votes ahead of the Conservatives; the Ashford Independents, a well-organised localist group with five Ashford councillors, finished in a strong third place.  One of the Labour councillors died shortly afterwards; the resulting by-election, in November 2011, saw Labour increase their majority over the Conservatives in a much more crowded field, and there was more bad news to come for the local Tories as their candidate in that by-election, landlord Cengizhan Cerit, was subsequently sent to prison for forging nine of the ten signatures on his nomination papers.  A further by-election in February 2013, caused by the resignation of the first by-election winner, saw the Labour majority greatly improve.  However, in 2015 Labour finally did lose a seat in the ward: not to the Tories, but to UKIP in a close three-way result: shares of the vote that year were 31% for the Labour slate, 30% for the single UKIP candidate and 27% for the Tory slate.  The ward's working-class UKIP credentials are borne out by Beaver being in the top 100 wards in England and Wales for lower supervisory or technical jobs (12% of the workforce) while unemployment and social renting are high.

So, this is a difficult defence for Labour who are under pressure on two fronts.  Their candidate is Caroline Harris, who represents South Ashford on various NHS local health groups.  The UKIP candidate is Ryan Macpherson, a security consultant and former special constable.  The Tory candidate Jo Gideon has a lot of local government experience: she was a Thanet councillor from 2003 to 2015 and fought Scunthorpe in the 2015 general election.  Completing the ballot paper is Green Party candidate Elizabeth Wright.

EAST BRIGHTON, Brighton and Hove council, East Sussex; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Maggie Barradell, who had served since 2015.

We finish this week's previews as we started: by the seaside.  The seafront of East Brighton ward consists of part of the Kemptown area around the Royal Sussex County Hospital, a traditionally bohemian area of Regency-style architecture.  Above it is the redeveloped and rather isolated council estate of Whitehawk, in a dry chalk valley with Brighton racecourse looping around it.  Much of the eastern half of the ward is open countryside, part of which is within the South Downs National Park.

Brighton and Hove was famously run by the Green Party from 2011 to 2015, but the Green administration quickly became unpopular and crashed and burned in the 2015 election, putting Labour back in minority control.  The Green surge never got anywhere near taking East Brighton ward, with Whitehawk making this one of the strongest Labour wards in the city: in May last year the Labour slate polled 46% to 22% for the Conservatives (whose vote presumably comes from the Kemptown waterfront) and 20% for the Greens in third place.  Going back a few years, the Tory slate here in 2007 included a celebrity candidate, the former Dollar singer David Van Day, to little discernible effect.

So the Labour candidate Lloyd Russell-Moyle should have little trouble defending this seat: he fought Lewes at the last general election and is a consultant for the United Nations on children and young people.  The Tory candidate is David Plant, the commercial director of a building services company and former captain of the non-league side Whitehawk FC.  The Greens have selected Mitch Alexander; she is setting up an organisation running drama workshops on the Whitehawk estate.  Also standing are Leigh Farrow (a former Tory city councillor) for UKIP, Andrew England (head of chemistry at Roedean School) for the Lib Dems and independent candidate Ramon Sammut.
