There are eight council by-elections on 29th September 2016.  There is a Lib Dem defence in rural Norfolk, and Labour defences in Blackpool and the Welsh valleys; but the Tories have most to lose this week with five seats up for election: a fascinating marginal ward in Hemel Hempstead, an unpredictable rural ward in Lincolnshire, a Northamptonshire village and a true-blue part of the Cotswolds are on the bill, but we start this week in Derby with what, on paper, should be the easiest Tory defence of the week...

ALLESTREE, Derby council; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Richard Smalley.

For our first, and definitely most controversial, poll of the week we are in the city of Derby.  Allestree is a northern suburb of Derby, lying on the edge of the city on the far side of the A38 bypass and nearly all developed since the Second World War (mostly in the late 1950s and early 1960s).  This is a solidly middle-class ward with very high rates of owner-occupation and - despite the presence within the ward of the main campus of the University of Derby - a relatively old age profile.  Famous people associated with the ward include the actor Sir Alan Bates and the football managers Brian and Nigel Clough, while for Derby residents Allestree is probably best known for the Markeaton and Allestree parks and the large Park Farm shopping centre.

This by-election is controversial because of the reason it came about.  Richard Smalley, who for many years has been director of a scrap metal company, was elected to Derby city council in 2002 representing Oakwood ward, and stood down from the council in 2008.  He returned to Derby city council for Allestree ward only in May, and was quickly elected as deputy leader of the Conservative group, but resigned just ten days after his election.  It soon became clear that Smalley had provided a false home address on his nomination papers for the election, and he is now serving a two-month prison sentence after pleading guilty to electoral fraud.

Bad news for the Derby Conservatives, who must now be looking at their large majority in this safe ward - Smalley beat Labour 59-16 in May - with rather more concern than usual.  Their candidate is Ged Potter.  Labour have reselected their candidate from May, Oleg Sotnicenko, and the ballot paper is completed by Deena Smith for the Lib Dems, Gaurav Pandey for UKIP and Marten Kats for the Green Party, whose ballot paper description "The Green Party - Say No To Racism" has been accepted despite going over the six-word limit.

CHERRY WILLINGHAM, West Lindsey council, Lincolnshire; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Alexander Bridgwood who is joining the armed forces.  He had served since 2015.

Staying in the East Midlands we come to a rural ward immediately to the east of Lincoln.  With a population of around 3,600, Cherry Willingham is by far the largest settlement in this ward and its population is growing fast through the recent construction of new estates, which have effectively filled in the space between Cherry Willingham and the neighbouring village of Reepham.

West Lindsey got new ward boundaries in 2015 which effectively merged the former two-member Cherry Willingham ward with most of the deeply rural Fiskerton ward.  The new three-seat ward resulted in no change to the party strengths in the area, with the previous independent councillor for Fiskerton being re-elected for the Lincolnshire Independents group and the Tories holding their two seats from the old Cherry Willingham ward: shares of the vote were 39% for the Tory slate, 35% for the Lincolnshire Independents and 26% for Labour.  The Bardney and Cherry Willingham county seat, which covers almost all of the ward, was also a Tory-Lincolnshire Independent marginal in the 2013 election but was safe Tory before that.

Defending for the Conservatives is Maureen Palmer, who has served in the Women's Royal Army Corps.  Labour have selected Wendy Beckett - not the nun and art critic but the lead Labour candidate here in the 2015 election.  Interestingly there will still be a Bridgwood on the ballot paper as UKIP have nominated Alexander's dad Trevor, an Army Cadet instructor, motorcycle enthusiast and British Legion figure.

GLAVEN VALLEY, North Norfolk council; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Andrew Wells, who has a new job in London with the law firm Allen and Overy.  He had served since 2015.

"We seek him here, we seek him there,
Those Frenchies seek him everywhere.
Is he in heaven?—Is he in hell?
That damned, elusive Pimpernel."

Now here's a rarity: a by-election in a Lib Dem-held seat.  Like Cherry Willingham above, here we have a case of a young councillor in his twenties leaving a rural area to take up a better-paid job elsewhere - a reminder that council work doesn't pay all that well.  In this deeply rural ward the largest centre of population, with 625 electors, is Blakeney, once a harbour on the north coast of Norfolk but now a major centre for birdwatching: the saltmarshes, sand dunes, shingle and mudflats north of Blakeney form an important centre for migrating birds and seals, and the Blakeney Point area has been the subject of ecological studies for more than a century.  This isn't all good news, because the Blakeney Point coastline is constantly changing and the path of the River Glaven can become blocked, causing flooding.  From Blakeney the ward travels south along the picturesque Glaven as far as the village of Stody.  Glaven Valley has an old age profile - 66% of the population are aged 45 or over, and the ward is in the top 200 in England and Wales for both retired people and self-employed people, reflecting its isolation.

Glaven Valley was a safe Conservative ward in the Noughties, but the Lib Dems suddenly broke through in the 2015 election to gain the ward with 47% of the vote, to 32% for the Conservatives and 11% for UKIP.  That gain meant that the Lib Dems now represent Glaven Valley at all three levels of government, having gained the North Norfolk constituency in 2001 and the local county council seat (Wells) in 2009.

With this ward being in the constituency of the Lib Dems' deputy leader a loss might be rather embarrassing.  Hoping that won't happen is Karen Ward, a business adviser from Sheringham.  The Tories have selected Andrew Livsey, a property developer from just outside the ward in Cley-next-the-Sea; he has put out a truly bizarre leaflet advertising himself as a "man of the people who loves a challenge" and demonstrating this by (inter alia) stating that he "won a Porsche 911 in a beer competition" and pointing to his appearances on TV game shows including Blind Date and The Crystal Maze.  Come back when you've reached the semi-finals of Mastermind, son, we'll talk then.  The UKIP candidate is John Dymond, who is the only candidate to give an address in the ward (in Stody), and the ballot paper is completed by Stephen Burke (a former Hammersmith and Fulham councillor) for Labour and Alicia Hull for the Green Party.

FINEDON, Wellingborough council, Northamptonshire; caused by the death of Conservative councillor John Bailey.  One of the UK's longest-serving councillors, Bailey was first elected in 1967 to the pre-reform Wellingborough urban district council, and had served continuously on the present Wellingborough borough council since its first election in 1973.  He was also a Northamptonshire county councillor from 1970 to 2013 and had served on Finedon parish council since its establishment in 1983.  Bailey's council career peaked in 2005-2011 when he was leader of Wellingborough council; he was twice Mayor of Wellingborough (1976-77 and 2004-05) and chairman of the county council in 2012-13, was chairman of Wellingborough's audit committee at the time of his death and chaired the borough's housing committee for 27 years.  In his working life, after studying at Selwyn College, Cambridge (where he was captain of the University Challenge team), he had been an economist-statistician with Shell-Mex and BP, an IBM programmer and an analyst and database administrator with British Timken.  In honour of his services to the community in Wellingborough, Bailey was appointed MBE in the 2016 New Year honours list.

Among his many achievements, John Bailey literally wrote the book on Finedon - in fact he wrote several which are cited on Finedon's Wikipedia page.  If we consult the oldest source in the National Archives, the Domesday book of 1086, Finedon (then known as Thingdon, from Old English words meaning "assembly valley" - a good omen for democracy) was one of four Northamptonshire towns with a population greater than fifty, but never achieved greatness.  In the eighteenth century Finedon was the home of the Dolben baronets, some of whom sat in Parliament including the lawyer Sir Gilbert Dolben (for Ripon, Peterborough and Yarmouth, Isle of Wight) and the anti-slavery campaigner Sir William Dolben (for Northamptonshire and Oxford University); they lived at Finedon Hall as did their descendant, the early Victorian poet Digby Mackworth Dolben who died from drowning aged 19.  The Dolben baronets would probably be rather surprised to hear that the present incumbent of Finedon's mid-fourteenth-century parish church is the former Communards singer and Radio 4 broadcaster Revd Richard Coles.  Coles' flock consists of 3,278 electors at the junction of the A6 Kettering-Bedford road and the A510 Wellingborough-Thrapston road, 4 miles north-east of Wellingborough.

Finedon has been a safe Conservative ward in the twenty-first century in which the party are not seriously challenged - in the 2007 and 2011 elections the Tory slate was guaranteed one seat due to their only opposition being a single Labour candidate.  Last year the Conservatives won with 47% to 27% for Labour and 26% for UKIP.  The Tories also hold the local county council seat - which includes the eastern part of Wellingborough town - but the last county result in 2013 was a three-way marginal with Labour second and UKIP third.

There will still be a Bailey on the ballot as John's widow Barbara, a Finedon parish councillor, defends the seat for the Conservatives.  The Labour candidate is Steve Ayland, who gives an address in Finedon.  UKIP have selected Allan Shipham, chairman of the party's Wellingborough branch, and the ballot paper is completed by Lib Dem candidate John Wheaver.

ADEYFIELD WEST, Dacorum council, Hertfordshire; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Sharon Adshead at the age of 63.  A former RAF air traffic controller and civil servant, Adshead had served since 2015.

For the week's only by-election in the Home Counties we are in Hemel Hempstead.  An old agricultural market town on the main transport arteries betwen London and the Midlands - the West Coast main line and the Grand Union canal - Hemel changed forever on 8th February 1950 when its first New Town residents moved into their new homes on Longlands, in the Adeyfield area.  Adeyfield is now big enough to support two wards in a large urban area, and the Adeyfield West ward essentially covers the area of Hemel immediately east of the town centre.  The ward's economic profile tends towards the working-class end and in 2011 more than a third of the households were still rented from what is now Hertfordshire's largest district by population, Dacorum council.

Adeyfield West is a fascinating marginal ward with a high councillor attrition rate - this is the third by-election here in the 2010s.  On its current boundaries the ward dates from 2007 but is not much changed from the pre-2007 Adeyfield West which was safe Labour.  The modern Adeyfield West is anything but.  In 2007 its two seats split between Labour and Conservative, and a by-election in March 2010 saw the Tories hold their seat with just 33% of the vote in a poll which saw a good Lib Dem third place and 14% for the BNP.  2011 was a return to the status quo ante, but a by-election in March 2013 saw Labour lose their seat - not to the Tories, but to the Lib Dems who despite polling just 15% in 2011 held, and fielded, the ward's county councillor.  The Tories and Lib Dems held their seats in 2015 in one of the closest four-way splits you will ever see: the re-elected Lib Dem councillor, who ran a long way ahead of his running-mate, had majorities of 11 votes over the second Conservative candidate, 19 votes over Labour and 43 votes over UKIP.  Shares of the vote in 2015 were 27% for the Conservatives, 25% for the Lib Dems and 24% each for Labour and UKIP, so there really is everything to play for here.

Defending for the Tories is Tony Gallagher, the runner-up in the 2015 election.  The Lib Dems have selected Adrian England.  The Labour candidate is Gary Cook, a former district councillor (until 2007) and county councillor (until 2009) seeking to return to elected office.  Rachel Biggs, chairman of the party's Hemel Hempstead branch, stands for UKIP.  Completing the ballot paper is Angela Lynch of the Green Party.

STOW, Cotswold council, Gloucestershire; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Barry Dare at the age of 79.  Dare first held elected office in his twenties on the pre-reform Twickenham borough council in the late 1950s or early 1960s; he was Conservative candidate for Leyton in the two 1974 elections, but it was in 1993 that his political career really took off when he was elected to Gloucestershire county council.  He became leader of the Conservative group in 2002, served as leader of the county council from 2005 to 2010 and co-ordinated the response to the devastating Severn floods of 2007.  Dare's business career was just as stellar; he ran his own accountancy business for over fifty years and served as chief executive of Unwins Seeds and the Cambridge chamber of commerce.  Dare had served on Cotswold council since 2003, initially for Blockley ward before transferring to Stow ward (his former county seat) in 2015; he had stood down from the county council in 2013.

Having travelled south to Hemel, we now move west to the Cotswolds.  Despite its hilltop location and high altitude, the town of Stow-on-the-Wold benefits from its location at the junction of several roads through the Cotswolds, including the A429 Fosse Way, and was given a market charter in 1107 by Henry I.  The town was the site of a battle in March 1646 in which the Royalists were defeated in the last major battle of the First Civil War.  The market is still going strong today, with the Stow Fairs in May and October being a popular venue for horse trading - literally, trading in horses.

The present Stow ward was created in 2015 by dividing the former Beacon-Stow ward in half, and adds to the town the small parishes of Maugersbury and Swell.  This means that there aren't many previous results to go on, but the northern Cotswolds is a true blue part of the country anyway.  That said, the only previous result on these boundaries was relatively close, the Tories beating the Lib Dems 56-44 in a straight fight.

Another straight fight is in prospect.  Defending in the blue corner is David Penman, who represented Beacon-Stow ward from January 2006 (gaining a by-election from an independent) to 2015 when he stood down.  Challenging in the yellow corner is Dilys Neill, a retired doctor from Moreton-in-Marsh.

BRYNMAWR, Blaenau Gwent council; caused by the death of Independent councillor John Hopkins at the age of 77.  A former teacher, Hopkins had served on Blaenau Gwent council since 1991 initially as Labour: he was leader of the council until 2007 and Labour candidate in the Blaenau Gwent by-election to the Welsh Assembly in 2006.  Hopkins left Labour in 2009 and had led the council's independent group until 2014.

"Crawshay Bailey had an Engine
It was always needin' mendin'
And dependin' on its power
It could do four miles an hour
Did you ever saw
Did you ever saw
Did you ever saw
Such a funny thing before?"

The combination of John Hopkins and Brynmawr might bring to mind a pair of American universities, but this is Wales, not the USA.  As befits its name (from the Welsh for "big hill"), Brynmawr is one of the highest towns in Wales, located at the head of the Valleys not less than 1,250 feet above sea level.  The town is so high up the Valleys that it was part of Breconshire until the 1974 local government reform; it was called into being by the Industrial Revolution thanks to the development of the Welsh coal industry and Crawshay Bailey's huge Nantyglo ironworks just down the valley.  Brynmawr was hit hard by the General Strike and the Great Depression, leading to the Quaker-led "Brynmawr Experiment" which tried to diversify the town into light industry such as boot and furniture manufacturing.  Another industry tried in the town was rubber manufacture in the modernist Dunlop Semtex factory (Semtex here being not the IRA's favourite explosive, but a brand of vinyl flooring) which despite being the first post-war UK building to be listed was demolished in 2001.  One local landmark which is thriving is the Market Hall cinema, which claims to the oldest cinema in Wales.  Brynmawr continues to suffer from high unemployment, with most of the jobs that exist being low-paid.

As an electoral unit Brynmawr ward dates back on its current boundaries to at least 1987 in the days when Blaenau Gwent was a district under Gwent county council; while the town used to have a Conservative councillor who served until 1999, Brynmawr's three seats have been fought over at each election this century between Labour and independents.  Blaenau Gwent is perfectly capable of electing independents under the right circumstances, as can be attested by Labour's two 2006 by-election losers Hopkins and Owen Smith (whatever happened to him?); in Brynmawr the independents led 57-43 at the most recent election in 2012, with Hopkins being re-elected under his new colours to make the seat split 2-1 in the independents' favour.  Labour only narrowly held off Plaid across Blaenau Gwent in May's Senedd election, suggesting that their machine here is in only slightly better working order than Crawshay Bailey's engine.

This by-election is a straight fight.  Defending for the independents is Wayne Hodgins, who finished fifth here in the 2012 election; he is a businessman and Brynmawr town councillor.  Challenging for Labour is Julian Gardner, another town councillor and singer-songwriter who is running an arts project at the Market Hall cinema.

TYLDESLEY, Blackpool council, Lancashire; caused by the death of Labour councillor Eddie Collett at the age of 58.  A college lecturer, Collett had served on Blackpool council since 1991(when it was still a district under Lancashire county council), except for the period 2007-11, and was mayor of Blackpool in 2013-14.  In tribute to one of the prime movers behind Blackpool's regeneration, the council arranged for a pair of bulldozers to greet well-wishers at Collett's wake in the town hall.

We finish this week in Blackpool, the archetypal English seaside resort.  The name of Tyldesley ward commemorates Edward Tyldesley, squire of Myerscough, who built a house here called Foxhall which was the first settlement of substance in what's now Blackpool.  The ward itself lies south-east of the town centre along Park Road, a series of inter-war terraces running as far as the eye can see, and includes some of the desirable housing on the edge of Stanley Park.

Tyldesley ward is normally Labour-inclined but was won by the Tories at Labour's low point in 2007, and the 2015 result - 38% for Labour, 29% for the Tories and 22% for UKIP - suggests that this is not a ward Labour can take for granted.  The party has decided to keep a Collett on the ballot paper by selecting Eddie's son David, a pro-NHS campaigner.  The Conservatives have reselected Moira Graham, a hotelier who was runner-up here in the 2015 election.  The UKIP candidate is Kim Knight, who runs a caravan hire firm, and the ballot paper is completed by Paul Hindley of the Lib Dems.
