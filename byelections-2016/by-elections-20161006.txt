Nine by-elections on 6th October 2016:

HEADLAND AND HARBOUR, Hartlepool council, County Durham; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Peter Jackson.  An electrical engineer, he had served since 2002.

A very descriptive name for a part of the country which tends not to get much attention.  This is a shame, for Hartlepool is an old and interesting town - or, more accurately, two towns.  Old Hartlepool, as West Hartlepudlians still call it, is a compact town based on a headland in the North Sea: it originally grew up as a religious settlement around the short-lived Hartlepool Abbey, of which no trace remains today; however, there is a fine Norman church on the headland dedicated to the abbey's second abbess, St Hilda of Whitby.  At the time of its building the de Brus family, later kings of Scotland, were lords of the manor, and Hartlepool became an important port and market town, with some medicinal springs - the poet Thomas Gray came here in the eighteenth century for the water.  (Unlike most of the north of England, Hartlepool's water is hard and was a noticeable change when I used to visit my grandparents here as a child in the 1980s and 1990s.)  

The Pool's harbour proved unable to cope with the Industrial Revolution, and by 1830 the town was starting to face competition from rival ports at Seaham, Port Clarence and Middlesbrough.  In response to this the borough council established a new dock and railway company, but its chairman - a solicitor called Ralph Ward Jackson - fell out with the council to the extent that he bought an area of sand-dunes to the south west and built a modern port and a new town called West Hartlepool on it.  By 1870 the port was thriving, the population was booming and Ward Jackson had become the first MP for the two Hartlepools.  At the turn of the century the Hartlepools were the third busiest port in England, which made the docks an obvious target in the First World War: and shortly before Christmas 1914 the Hartlepools were bombarded by the imperial German Navy with the loss of 117 lives.

The town suffered badly from the post-industrial bust after the Second World War, with the end of shipbuilding and steelworking resulting in very high unemployment.  Despite this, the docks are an important employer in the town proper, with a large amount of regeneration work undertaken in the 1990s the most obvious effect of which is the Maritime Experience, a series of old dock buildings which houses the town's museum and the oldest Royal Navy warship still afloat, HMS Trincomalee.  The maritime sector is still important to Hartlepool: the Tall Ships were here in 2010; the port, despite much of it having been turned into a marina, can still handle large vessels; and there are still manufacturing jobs in the town supporting the oil and offshore wind industries.

With all this dock history it's no surprise that Hartlepool is a Labour town - not coincidentally, the only Tory MP for the town since the Second World War was Commander John "Yangtse Incident" Kerans.  My grandmother used to say that a monkey could win Hartlepool if it had a red rosette.  Turns out the red rosette wasn't actually required: in the town's inaugural mayoral election in 2002 the winning candidate was a 28-year-old independent called Stuart Drummond, who was only standing as a publicity stunt: at the time he was spending every other Saturday parading up and down Victoria Park in a monkey costume as the mascot for Hartlepool United football club.  While Drummond's election made headlines around the world, Labour had it coming in the town at the time - then MP Peter Mandelson was scandal-prone and locally unpopular, and an electoral pact between the Tories and Lib Dems had led to Labour losing control of the council in 2000.  Despite his previous reputation, in office Drummond's governing style was sober and professional; even though he never did implement his only election pledge - free bananas for Hartlepool's schoolchildren - he was twice re-elected and it took a referendum on abolition of the mayoral system for Labour to get rid of him.  (He had the same number of wins at the ballot box as the Pools have had on the pitch so far this season.)

One of Drummond's last acts in office was a boundary review which drastically reduced the size of the council to take into account its then mayoral structure.  That brought into being the modern Headland and Harbour ward, which is essentially a merger of the former St Hilda and Stranton wards.  At the 2011 census Stranton ward - which covered the docks and the housing south of Hartlepool railway station - had the seventh highest unemployment rate in the whole of England and Wales (12.8% of the workforce) and also made the top 100 for long-term sickness or disability (11.1%).  St Hilda wasn't much better, just outside the top 100 for unemployment.  Qualification rates and owner-occupation are low across the ward.

Obvious territory for UKIP, who scored 10% across the town in the by-election after Peter Mandelson left for Brussels - unremarkable now, but noteworthy in 2004.  UKIP followed up by gaining the independent-inclined St Hilda ward in the 2006 borough elections, but lost their seat to Labour in 2010.  Stranton ward was strongly Labour before its abolition in 2012, and in the first election to the new Headland and Harbour ward in 2012 Labour won all three seats fairly comfortably with a strong second place for the localist slate "Putting Hartlepool First" - which included the former UKIP councillor.  Since then this ward has been marginal for Labour who reportedly have been suffering from infighting in Hartlepool; Putting Hartlepool First reduced the Labour lead to 46-38 in the 2014 election, UKIP took over second place in 2015 with 31%, to 38% for Labour and 13% for Putting Hartlepool First, and in May's election with no Putting Hartlepool First candidate on the ballot UKIP broke through to gain the ward from Labour by 619 votes to 617, both parties polling 46%.

With Hartlepool voting strongly for Leave in the referendum, this is an opportunity for UKIP to gain.  The defending Labour candidate is Trevor Rogan, a dockworker and former borough councillor (Brus ward, 2004-12) who hit the headlines in 2007 and 2008 after being cleared of a wife-beating conviction on appeal.  UKIP's candidate is Tim Fleming, a dentist.  Also standing are official Conservative candidate Benjamin Marshall, independent Chris Broadbent (who was the Tory candidate here in May), Steve Latimer of Putting Hartlepool First (who was runner-up here in 2014) and John Price for National Health Action.

RUMWORTH, Bolton council, Greater Manchester; caused by the death of Labour councillor Rosa Kay at the age of 79.  A former magistrate, who was first elected in 1999 after previously being the council's Unison rep, Kay had held a number of key positions in the Bolton cabinet.  In recent years she had suffered from poor health and was a wheelchair user; last year her carer was sent to prison for stealing £8,000 from her bank account.

From Hartlepool to the Greatest Town in the Known Universe.  Or perhaps not, if you look at what has happened to Bolton town centre this summer.  British Home Stores, the flagship store on Victoria Square opposite the town hall - gone.  Prestons of Bolton, which has sold wedding rings to the fiancés of the North West for 150 years - gone.  Whitakers (now Beales) department store - closing down.  The Albert Halls, Bolton's premier event space in the town hall - closed for refurbishment for two years now and no guarantee that it will reopen in the same form, given that the council has laid off all the front-of-house staff.  The Victoria Halls, Bolton's premier concert hall run by the Methodists - living from week to week.  (To keep it open, I recommend going there on Friday night for a concert by your columnist's friends in the Greater Manchester Police band and the superlative pipers of the Royal Scots Manchester branch.)  Your columnist could name several further prominent front teeth which have been knocked out of the town centre recently, with the prospect of more to come, and what are the council doing about it?  Refurbishing the town hall and building a new bus station so that people can come to a town centre that's not worth visiting on buses they can't afford to pay the fare for.  Great.  The contrast with Bury, which had the foresight to open a thriving new town centre extension at the low point of the recession, is striking.

To redress the balance slightly, there are some nice buildings going up at the bottom end of Deane Road, but that has more to do with the University who are on a growth spurt at the moment.  Some of the University site spills over into Rumworth ward, which covers the Willows area south-west of the town centre along Deane Road and St Helens Road - redbrick terraces as far as the eye can see on high ground overlooking the town centre.  Like Stranton in Hartlepool, this makes the top 100 wards in England and Wales for people who have never worked or are long-term unemployed, but not for the same reason.  Rumworth is a majority-Asian ward: 55% of the population are of Asian heritage, overwhelmingly from Pakistan, and 52% are Muslim.  That Pakistani heritage shows itself in other census stats: as well as the large population who have never worked, 27% of the population are under 16.  Social housing rates and unemployment are high and those jobs which exist are low-paid working-class ones.

There's not much chance of this by-election resulting in any change to the council composition or direction, as Rumworth is one of the strongest Labour wards in the country.  In May's election Rosa Kay had a relatively low 72% of the vote, with 10% for the Tories best of the rest.  This should therefore be an easy hold for Labour candidate Shamim Abdullah; she is opposed by Mohammed Waqas of the Conservatives, UKIP's Joseph Baxendale, Alan Johnson of the Green Party and Becky Forrest of the Lib Dems.

ST ANN'S, Haringey council, North London; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Peter Morton who is starting a new non-political job.  He had served since 2014.

This week's London by-election takes place in that area where Harringay ends and Tottenham begins.  The main features of the ward are Chestnuts Park and St Ann's Hospital, mainly a mental health unit, while the St Ann's Road links the ward together.  At the south-west corner is Harringay Green Lanes station on the Gospel Oak-Barking line (closed for rebuilding), while Seven Sisters station lies just off the ward's eastern end.

Like much of Haringey, St Ann's ward has been a major focus for immigration in recent years - at the time of the last census 15% of the population were born in the new EU states and 31% were from the "White Other" ethnic group.  The ward's economic profile is just as mixed, although unemployment is relatively high.  This results in a safe Labour ward which has seen some unusual second place scores - Respect were runners up in the 2006 election, the Lib Dems did well in 2010 but at the most recent borough election in 2014 Labour led 51-21 over the Green Party.  The Greens were also second at the Mayor and Assembly elections in May, with Sadiq Khan winning 66-12 and Labour winning the London Members ballot 59-17.

Labour's choice of candidate has raised some eyebrows: Noah Tucker is a Momentum figure who has become caught up in the Labour anti-Semitism scandal.  The Green candidate is Ronald Stewart who stood for the London Assembly in May; also standing are Ellis Turrell for the Conservatives, Josh Dixon for the Lib Dems and Janus Polenceusz for UKIP.

BASING, Basingstoke and Deane council, Hampshire; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Clive Pinder, who had served since 2015.

"There was an Old Person of Basing,
Whose presence of mind was amazing;
He purchased a steed,
Which he rode at full speed,
And escaped from the people of Basing."
- Edward Lear

Located immediately to the east of Basingstoke, Basing ward has a history of conflict.  In January 871 the Vikings defeated the West Saxons, under King Ethelred I, in battle here, and during the Civil War Basing House, the home of the Marquesses of Winchester, was destroyed in a 24-week siege.  Old Basing, as the village is now known, was on the old road from London to Winchester and the south west, but now functions as a dormitory village for Basingstoke: the ward also includes Lychpit, a 1980s housing development which is effectively a part of Basingstoke that has spilled over the parish boundary.  

Recent conflicts in Basing ward have generally seen the Tories victorious.  On its current boundaries the ward dates from at least 1992, having survived boundary changes in 2002 and 2008 unscathed; it was a Lib Dem hotspot from 1995 to 2005, but the Tories are now in control of the ward's elections, if not entirely in control of their own councillors - the 2014 election re-elected as an independent a councillor who had had a falling out with the Conservatives.  In May the Tories had 64% with the Lib Dems, UKIP and Labour all on 12%.  The Tories also hold the local county seat (Basing is within Loddon division, named after the river it stands on).

Defending for the Tories is Paul Gaskell, a chartered engineer and parish councillor within the ward.  He is opposed by Richard Lilleker for the Lib Dems and Andrew Toal for Labour.

EXMOUTH BRIXINGTON, East Devon council; caused by the death of Conservative councillor David Chapman at the age of 71.  A former Merchant Navy officer and bank manager (retiring as South West area manager of Lloyds Bank), Chapman had served on the district council and Exmouth town council since 2007, chairing the town council's finance committee for three years.

After a previous visit in July, this column returns to Exmouth.  A tourist centre in season and a commuter town for Exeter, Exmouth's main function is as a retirement centre: although Brixington ward, located away from the seafront in the north-east corner of Exmouth, isn't the oldest ward in the town, 53.5% of the population are over 45 and 21% of the workforce are retired.  The ward has high rates of owner-occupation and part-time working (18% of the workforce).

Brixington ward safely returned three Lib Dems in 2003, but the Conservatives took two of the three seats in the 2007 election.  The remaining Lib Dem councillor sought and won re-election as an independent in 2011, and upon his retirement the Tories returned their full slate in the 2015 election; shares of the vote were 36% for the Tories, 28% for the Independent East Devon Alliance and 19% for the Lib Dems.  However, at county level this ward is combined with a stronger Lib Dem area to produce the Exmouth Brixington and Withycombe seat which in 2013 voted - UKIP, coming through the middle of an even Lib Dem/Tory split to win with just 33% of the vote.

Defending for the Tories is Darryl Nicholas, a former councillor for this ward (2007-2011) seeking to make a comeback.  The Independent East Devon Alliance, a well-organised localist slate, have selected Robin Humphreys who has retired to Exmouth after a career in management training.  Completing the ballot paper is Alex Sadiq; she is secretary of a vehicle repair company with the puntastic name of Exepress Autos.

GILFACH and RISCA EAST, Caerphilly council, Gwent; caused by the resignations of Labour councillors Harry Andrews and Rhianon Passmore respectively.  Andrews, who served as leader of Caerphilly council from 2004 to 2008 and from 2012 to 2014, is retiring after 49 years' service in local government, while Passmore has been elected to the Senedd as Labour AM for Islwyn.

After Brynmawr last week, we have two more by-elections in the Welsh valleys to examine.  The ex-mining village of Gilfach lies on the Glamorgan side of the Rhymney valley, south of Bargoed (whose town council it is part of) and north of Pengam.  It is connected to the outside world by the tiny railway station of Gilfach Fargoed on the Rhymney Valley line.  Risca lies in the south-east corner of Caerphilly district in the Sirhowy valley; again, it is traditionally a mining town, but the East ward is based on Ty-Sign, a housing estate built in the 1960s for workers at Llanwern steelworks.  Today Risca is effectively a Newport suburb, but trains from the Risca and Pontymister railway station (opened in 2008 on the Ebbw Vale branch) only go to Cardiff.

Risca East has had a full slate of three Labour councillors since 2004 when Labour gained the last seat in the ward from Plaid Cymru.  In the 2012 election the Labour slate beat an independent candidate 57-24, while a previous by-election in May 2013 gave Labour 44% to 25% and 18% for two independent candidates.  Andrews had turned Gilfach into his personal fiefdom and he had a large personal vote there: in 2012 he polled 86% in a straight fight with Plaid.

The voters of Gilfach will have a wider choice this time round.  Defending for Labour is Lindsey Harding, a Bargoed town councillor for the ward; he is opposed by Ken Houston of Plaid, Andrew Creak for the Green Party and Glenys Griffiths for UKIP.

There will still be a Passmore on the ballot paper in Risca as Labour have selected Rhianon's daughter Arianna Passmore, a music and film teacher and Risca town councillor for Trenewydd ward (part of the East division).  With no independent candidates this time round, she is opposed by Matthew Farrell of Plaid, Matthew Kidner of the Lib Dems and Joe Smyth of UKIP.

GARSCADDEN/SCOTSTOUNHILL, Glasgow city council, caused by the death of Labour councillor John Kelly.  He had served since 2012 after being a longstanding CWU activist.

For the first of the week's two Scottish by-elections we are in north-west Glasgow.  The Garscadden area was annexed by Glasgow in 1926 for new housing, and the Low Knightswood area was quickly filled with new houses along the Great Western Road, built on garden-city principles.  Further down towards the river lies the Victorian enclave of Scotstounhill, Garscadden itself and Yoker.  Much of the ward's riverfront is taken up with shipbuilding, with BAE Systems building new craft for the Royal Navy at the Scotstoun and Yarrows shipyards; a ferry links Yoker with Renfrew on the far bank of the Clyde, while the Argyle Line stations of Garscadden and Scotstounhill link the ward with Glasgow city centre.

While the local MP and MSP are both SNP members, Glasgow city council was last up for election in 2012 which was before the independence referendum and consequent SNP surge in Scotland.  In 2012 Labour led the SNP 62-27 which represented no swing at all since 2007, and Labour comfortably won three seats to the SNP's one.  A mountain to climb for the SNP, but in present political conditions certainly achievable.

Defending for Labour is Ian Cruikshank, who is described as a local man.  The SNP have selected Chris Cunningham, younger brother of Scottish environment secretary Roseanna Cunningham and director of the Shettleston housing association.  Also standing are Gillian Macdonald for the Scottish Green Party, Ary Jaff for the Conservatives, Liberal Democrat James Speirs and UKIP candidate Donald Mackay (who gives an address over 25 miles away in Lanark).

CULLODEN AND ARDERSIER, Highland council; caused by the death of Labour councillor John Ford at the age of 85.  The oldest Highland councillor, Ford had served since 2003 after a career in the electricity supply industry; he died suddenly while on holiday in Jersey.

For our final by-election this week we are at the location where the Young Pretender's luck finally ran out in the 1745 rebellion.  The battle itself was all over in less than an hour after a failed charge by the Highlanders, but its effects resonated for many years to come: one effect within this ward was the construction of Fort George on a promontory east of Inverness to guard the narrowest point of the Moray Firth, in defence against a third Jacobite invasion which never came.  The Army are still at Fort George which is home to the Black Watch, but the fort is almost unaltered since the eighteenth century and now mostly open to the public as a museum.  The construction of Fort George led to the resettlement of the nearby fishing village of Blacktown into a new village called Ardersier.

While Ardersier is in a rural area, this ward is essentially Inverness suburbia.  At its first election in 2007 it elected Robert Wynd of the SNP (previously councillor for the suburban Balloch ward), independent Roddy Balfour (whose former ward was the rural Ardersier, Croy and Petty), Labour's John Ford (who had been elected for the suburban Culloden ward in 2003) and Lib Dem Glynis Sinclair.  In the 2007-2012 term Sinclair defected to the SNP and stood for re-election under her new colours in 2012; as it turned out there weren't enough votes for two SNP seats and it was Bob Wynd who lost out while Labour held their seat.  The shares of the vote in 2012 show how fragmented the result was: 30% for Roddy Balfour, who topped the poll, 27% for the SNP and 14% each for Labour and the Lib Dems.

With a starting point of only 14% Labour have it all to do to hold this by-election; remember, the Alternative Vote is being used so it will be important to attract transfers as well as poll a good first preference score.  The defending Labour candidate is Andrew Mackintosh, a storyteller and researcher for a Labour MSP.  Four independent candidates have come forward: Thomas Lamont (who runs a taxi firm), Duncan Macpherson (chairman of Cradlehall and Westhill community council), David McGrath (who finished sixth here in 2012) and John Ross (a B&B owner in Ardersier).  The SNP candidate is Pauline Munro, former councillor for Inverness West ward who lost her seat in 2012.  The Lib Dems have nominated Trish Robertson, chair of Ardersier and Petty community council.  Completing the ballot paper are Isla Macleod-O'Reilly for the Scottish Greens and the Tories' Andrew Jarvie.
