One Monday by-election on 5th December 2016:

<h2>CARNOUSTIE AND DISTRICT</h2>

Angus council; caused by the death of Scottish National Party councillor Helen Oswald at the age of 69.  The Provost of Angus since 2012, Oswald was first elected in 1999, serving for Sidlaw East ward until 2007.  Before moving into politics she had worked in insurance, as an estate agent and for the council.  Her daughter Kirsten has served since 2015 as MP for East Renfrewshire.

Last Monday we were in Arbroath; for our second Monday by-election in as many weeks we travel a few miles west along the coast to Carnoustie.  Known worldwide for its golf course, which is on the Open Championship rota, Carnoustie developed in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries as a centre for linen weaving and tourism - it was promoted as the Brighton of the North.  While the town does still attract tourists - although these days for the golf rather than the bathing - the economy is now based on commuting to Dundee along the A92 and the railway line, although two of the three stations within this ward - Barry Links and Golf Street - only get two trains a day and usually finish near the top of the annual list of the UK's least-used railway stations.  The ward also includes a rural hinterland running inland as far as the Monikie reservoir.  Although golf isn't the only sport in town - the Barry Buddon rifle range hosted the shooting events at the 1986 and 2014 Commonwealth Games - the difficulty of the course in the 1999 Open, memorable for the French golfer Jean van de Velde blowing a huge lead on the final hole, inspired the term "Carnoustie effect" for the shock created when false assumptions meet reality.

The Scottish National Party - for whom Carnoustie is a traditionally strong area - have been suffering a little from the Carnoustie effect of late.  They dominated the 2007 election here, polling 47% and winning two of the three seats, the other seat going to Labour; but at the end of 2010 one of the SNP councillors resigned on health grounds and the Nationalists lost the by-election in February 2011 to independent candidate Brian Boyd, who started 37 votes behind the SNP but pulled ahead on transfers from the other parties to win by 28 votes.  The SNP's woes continued in the 2012 election: they failed to knock out Boyd, who topped the poll, and failed to gain the Labour seat which went to a second independent candidate, Bill Bowles, who got strong transfers from Boyd, the Conservatives and Labour; first preferences were 40% for Boyd, 36% for the SNP and 11% for Bowles.  The SNP hold the local parliamentary seat (Dundee East) and Holyrood seat (Angus South), and following their by-election gain in Arbroath last week a hold in this by-election will give them overall control of Angus council.

So, high stakes for the defending SNP candidate Mark McDonald, from Monifieth.  His toughest challenge may well come from independent candidate David Cheape, an accountant who is the only candidate to give an address in Carnoustie.  Also standing are Ray Strachan for Labour, Derek Shaw for the Conservatives and Beth Morrison for the Liberal Democrats.  Don't wait up all night for the result, as the count will start on Tuesday morning at 10am.

By-elections on 8th December 2016:

<hr>

<h2>SLEAFORD AND NORTH HYKEHAM</h2>

House of Commons; caused by the resignation of Conservative MP Stephen Phillips, who is dissatisfied with the Government's strategy for leaving the European Union.  He had served since 2010.

For the first time since 1990 we have two parliamentary by-elections taking place in successive weeks.  After last week's sensational poll in Richmond, Surrey, today we are in a rather different part of the UK.

The Sleaford and North Hykeham constituency covers a large swathe of rural Lincolnshire to the south of Lincoln.  It is named after its only two towns.  Sleaford, the larger of the two, was once the home of the county council for the Parts of Kesteven, the south-western of Lincolnshire's three Parts, and now houses the National Centre for Craft and Design, an arts centre on a disused wharf on the River Slea.  Sleaford grew up in the 19th century as an agricultural centre, with seeds and maltings as important industries.  Rather different is North Hykeham, which is a Lincoln suburb that has never been incorporated into the city.  Also here are a couple of tiny corners of Grantham where recent development has spilled over the town limits.  But the political tone of the constituency is set by the many villages within the seat, while the presence of RAF Cranwell, at which the Royal Air Force trains its officers and flying instructors, provides a military tone to the area.  The Lincoln Cliff runs through the seat from north to south, with higher ground to the east overlooking the low-lying Trent Valley to the west and Holland to the east - the Parts of Holland, not the country on the other side of the North Sea.

The general pattern of parliamentary constituencies in what was Kesteven, with a northern and a southern seat, has survived basically unchanged since 1885 but has had varying names: from 1885 to 1918 it was called Sleaford, from 1918 to 1997 Grantham, only taking on its current name in 1997 when Grantham was moved out of the seat.  If the proposed boundary changes go through as they are, then the Sleaford name will be revived for the 2020 election with North Hykeham moving into the Lincoln constituency.

Sleaford's first MP in 1885 was already a political veteran.  Henry Chaplin had been in the Commons since 1868 as MP for Mid Lincolnshire; a major landowner in the county, Chaplin was also a prominent racehorse owner whose horse, Hermit, had won the Derby in 1867.  Going into the 1885 election he had joined government for the first time as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster; although he held his seat, defeating the Liberal candidate Charles Sharpe 58-42, the Tories lost that election and it took Chaplin until 1889 to join Cabinet, as the first President of the Board of Agriculture in Salisbury's administration; in order to take up that appointment Chaplin had to seek re-election in his constituency, that being the rule until the First World War; he had to seek re-election again upon his re-appointment to the Cabinet in 1895 as President of the Local Government Board, his Agriculture appointment having ended in 1892.

Chaplin wasn't included in Salisbury's cabinet after the 1900 election, and went to the backbenches where he campaigned in favour of tariff reform.  After 38 years as MP for Sleaford he was swept away in the Liberal landslide of 1906, but returned to the Commons a year later by winning a by-election in Wimbledon, and was later translated to the Lords as the first Viscount Chaplin.  In an interesting link with last week's by-election, Henry Chaplin was Zac Goldsmith's great-great-grandfather: his daughter Edith married the 7th Marquess of Londonderry, whose granddaughter Lady Annabel Vane-Tempest-Stewart married James Goldsmith.

The new Liberal MP for Sleaford was Arnold Lupton, a professor of mining at Leeds University and colliery director.  A free trade supporter, Lupton was at odds with Herbert Asquith on several issues and never got anywhere near government; Lupton was later sent to prison for pacifist activity during the Great War.  He was rather soundly defeated in the first 1910 election by Edmund Royds.
