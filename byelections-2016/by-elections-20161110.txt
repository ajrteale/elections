Four by-elections on Thursday 10th November, all in London and the South East:

<h2>ELTHAM NORTH</h2>
Greenwich council, South London; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Wynn Davies.

London by-election watchers have had to exist on a diet of predominantly safe Labour wards for much of this year, so it's refreshing to be able to talk about a marginal ward for once.  We're in Eltham (the H is silent), a district of London with royal connections since mediaeval times: the Plantagenet kings had a palace here.  However, this ward is based on the garden-city Progress Estate, built entirely in 1915 by Woolwich Borough Council along the Well Hall Road; the reason for its construction at the height of the First World War was to provide accommodation for workers at the Woolwich Arsenal munitions factory, to which it was connected by a busy tram line along Well Hall Road.  Unfortunately, Well Hall Road is notable these days not for the estate, but as the scene of the notorious Stephen Lawrence murder in 1993.  The estate is still close to its original condition despite the construction through it of the A2 Rochester Way Relief Road, built next to the Bexleyheath railway line and necessetating the construction of a new Eltham railway station to serve the ward.  Also within the ward are the two halves of Eltham Park (bisected by the relief road) and the northern half of Eltham High Street.  This is one of the parts of London least affected by its transformation into a world city, and its census statistics are unremarkable.

As stated, Eltham North is a marginal ward under current conditions; it returned a full slate of Tories throughout the Noughties (very comfortably in 2006) but although the Tories still topped the poll at the last borough elections in 2014 (32% Conservative, 31% Labour, 20% UKIP) thanks to a personal vote for long-serving councillor Spencer Drury, the seat count actually went 2-1 to Labour who were slightly better at getting their voters to follow the whole ticket.  The Conservatives led here in May's London Assembly elections, with Zac Goldsmith beating Sadiq Khan 43-34 and the Tories carrying the London Members ballot with 34%, to 31% for Labour and 13% for UKIP.

So, this could be a rather difficult defence for Labour.  Their candidate is Simon Peirce, who was on the Labour slate in 2014 but ran a long way behind his running-mates.  The Tories' Charlie Davis must fancy his chances of a gain after contesting the hopeless Eltham West ward in 2014; just 22 years old, he works in financial services and a keen rugby player.  The UKIP candidate is Barbara Ray, who fought Kidbrooke with Hornfair ward in 2014.  Also standing are Matt Browne, who was the Tory candidate in the last Greenwich by-election (in Glyndon ward in May) but now has the Green nomination, and Sam Macaulay for the Lib Dems.
