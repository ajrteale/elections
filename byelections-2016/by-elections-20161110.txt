<h2>ELTHAM NORTH</h2>
Greenwich council, South London; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Wynn Davies.

http://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/greenwich-eltham-n.png

London by-election watchers have had to exist on a diet of predominantly safe Labour wards for much of this year, so it's refreshing to be able to talk about a marginal ward for once.  We're in Eltham (the H is silent), a district of London with royal connections since mediaeval times: the Plantagenet kings had a palace here.  However, this ward is based on the garden-city Progress Estate, built entirely in 1915 by Woolwich Borough Council along the Well Hall Road; the reason for its construction at the height of the First World War was to provide accommodation for workers at the Woolwich Arsenal munitions factory, to which it was connected by a busy tram line along Well Hall Road.  Unfortunately, Well Hall Road is notable these days not for the estate, but as the scene of the notorious Stephen Lawrence murder in 1993.  The estate is still close to its original condition despite the construction through it of the A2 Rochester Way Relief Road, built next to the Bexleyheath railway line and necessitating the construction of a new Eltham railway station to serve the ward.  Also within the ward are the two halves of Eltham Park (bisected by the relief road) and the northern half of Eltham High Street.  This is one of the parts of London least affected by its transformation into a world city, and its census statistics are unremarkable.

As stated, Eltham North is a marginal ward under current conditions; it returned a full slate of Tories throughout the Noughties (very comfortably in 2006) but although the Tories still topped the poll at the last borough elections in 2014 (32% Conservative, 31% Labour, 20% UKIP) thanks to a personal vote for long-serving councillor Spencer Drury, the seat count actually went 2-1 to Labour who were slightly better at getting their voters to follow the whole ticket.  The Conservatives led here in May's London Assembly elections, with Zac Goldsmith beating Sadiq Khan 43-34 and the Tories carrying the London Members ballot with 34%, to 31% for Labour and 13% for UKIP.

So, this could be a rather difficult defence for Labour.  Their candidate is Simon Peirce, who was on the Labour slate in 2014 but ran a long way behind his running-mates.  The Tories' Charlie Davis must fancy his chances of a gain after contesting the hopeless Eltham West ward in 2014; just 22 years old, he works in financial services and a keen rugby player.  The UKIP candidate is Barbara Ray, who fought Kidbrooke with Hornfair ward in 2014.  Also standing are Matt Browne, who was the Tory candidate in the last Greenwich by-election (in Glyndon ward in May) but now has the Green nomination, and Sam Macaulay for the Lib Dems.

<h2>QUEENSTOWN</h2>
Wandsworth council, South London; caused by the death of Labour councillor Sally-Ann Ephson at the age of 49.  A board member of the Sickle Cell Society, the disease from which she died, and described as a "wonderful councillor" and a "positive force for good", she had served since 2014.

Writing this column is usually a good way of doing quiz revision, but it doesn't always work that way.  Last week I wrote on the subject of Silicon Roundabout and the cluster of technology companies which has sprung up in the area; over the last weekend I was in Athens at the Quiz Olympiad and the question came up "which major multinational company is consolidating all its London offices into the redeveloped Battersea Power Station?"  Well, given what I wrote last week obviously it can't be Apple, I thought, at which point an inflatable pink pig flew past the window with my chances of winning the quiz attached to it.  Oh dear.

The redevelopment of Battersea Power Station is only the latest phase of the gentrification that has transformed Queenstown ward out of all recognition.  The ward runs along the south bank of the Thames from Battersea Park in the west to the New Covent Garden Market, the UK's largest market for wholesale fruit, vegetables and flowers, in the east.  In between is Battersea Dogs and Cats Home, supplier of Chief Mousers to Whitehall, and the ward's population in between a tangle of railway viaducts along which a million people travel every day in and out of Victoria and Waterloo stations; transport is important to the local economy with a large bus garage and the Gatwick Express maintenance depot located in the ward, although the locomotive works at Nine Elms - once the terminus of the railway line to Southampton - are long gone, replaced by the market.  Despite this, the only railway stations within the ward are the rather run down Battersea Park and Queenstown Road (Battersea), although the Power Station redevelopers are paying for a new Tube line to serve the area which should start construction in the new year.

Queenstown ward now has a middle-class demographic with over half the workforce educated to degree level, nearly half in management positions, high employment levels and low rates of owner-occupation - both social and private renting are high.  The ward makes the top 100 for population born in the EU-14 states (8.7%).  It's a world away from how Battersea was a hundred years ago, when it was a working-class area noted for heavy industry - the Power Station is just the most notable survivor of the many major factories and waterworks which once lined the Thames here.  The heavy industry led to unusually strong unionisation by London standards and radical politics to match: Battersea was the first borough to elect a black mayor (John Archer in 1913) and the inter-war Battersea North constituency, around half of which is now this ward, was one of very few constituencies to return a Communist to Parliament (the Indian Parsee Shapurji Saklatvala, who served from 1922 to 23 and again from 1924 to 29.  After the Second World War the Clean Air Act did for most of the heavy industry in Battersea, and new council estates - notably the Patmore Estate - were built to replace some particularly delapidated slums.  The Power Station itself was the last survivor, as can be seen in the above 1972 painting by Robert Lowry.  Queenstown ward, which goes back to 1964 with the creation of the modern Wandsworth borough, became depopulated as a result and took in some more Tory-voting areas.  John O'Farrell described the Tory gain of Queenstown in 1990 in his book Things Can Only Get Better, and by the end of 1990s, even though the Blair landslide had given Wandsworth a full slate of Labour MPs, Wandsworth council had a large Tory majority thanks to its adminstration's unbelievably-low-council-tax policies.

Some favourable boundary changes in 2002 have enabled Labour to keep this ward marginal, but it took until 2014 for them to regain a seat in Queenstown ward; in that year the Tory slate topped the poll 40-39.  Labour will take encouragement from the GLA results in May, in which Khan beat Goldsmith here 44-36 and Labour carried the London Members ballot with 39%, to 32% for the Tories and 9% for the Greens.  However, as explained above, the Tory administration tends to outperform in Wandsworth council elections compared to other levels.

Defending this difficult ward for Labour is Aydin Osborne Dikerdem, who despite his Turkish name was born and bred in Battersea; despite his age (26) he already has the distinction of having been attacked by the Daily Telegraph for getting a motion passed earlier this year to limit voting rights at Oxford University Labour Club.  The Tories want their seat back, and have selected Rhodri Morgan who is not to be confused with the former First Minister of Wales of that name.  Completing the ballot paper are Stella Baker for the Greens and Richard Davis for the Lib Dems.

<h2>SOUTHWATER</h2>
Horsham council, West Sussex; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Ian Howard.  A former cabinet member on Horsham council, he had served since 2007.

http://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/horsham-southwater.png

Moving out of London we come to Southwater, a large village just south of Horsham which has been almost entirely developed since 1970 and is still growing strongly.  Although the village's traditional industry was brickmaking, the brickworks are now housing and the area now has a commuter demographic.  However, Southwater's census stats are a little difficult to interpret because the ward also includes the large boarding school of Christ's Hospital, which apparently is important enough to merit its own railway station on the Arun Valley line; the presence of the boarders mean that Southwater is in the top 100 wards in England and Wales for 16- and 17-year-olds (5.1%) and those educated to GCSE level (21% of the workforce, which for this purpose includes everybody aged 16 or over).

Like many fast-growing village-based wards, this ward is trending Conservative; it voted Lib Dem in 2003 but the Tory slate gained in 2007, and by 2015 the Conservatives were well ahead with 36%, to 17% for the Lib Dems, 15% for UKIP and 11% for an independent candidate.  The local county division (Southwater and Nuthurst) is also Tory, although UKIP came close at the most recent county elections in 2013.

Defending for the Tories is Billy Greening, a Southwater parish councillor and (judging from his Twitter) diehard Brighton and Hove Albion fan; he works for a private prison company.  The Lib Dem candidate is Richard Greenwood, a charity worker presently working for the Jesuits.  UKIP have selected Uri Baran, who works for a large IT company.  The independent candidate from 2015 is not standing again, so Labour's Kevin O'Sullivan completes the ballot paper.

<h2>HITCHIN OUGHTON</h2>
North Hertfordshire council; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Simon Watson after less than five months in office.  He had served since May.

http://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/n-herts-hitchin-oughton.png

We finish this week north of London in Hitchin.  The Oughton ward, named after the river which forms its north-western boundary, is Hitchin's north-western ward and is essentially a small council estate off the Bedford road with few points of interest.  It is the safest Labour ward in Hitchin, the party beating the Tories 49-32 in May, and also forms part of the Labour-held Hitchin North county council division.

Labour are taking no chances in defending this by-election by selecting Martin Stears-Handscomb, who represented this ward on North Hertfordshire council from 1979 to 1988 and again from 1998 to 2000, transferring in 2000 to Hitchin Bearton ward which he represented until losing his seat in 2010; he retires as an accountant this month and has previously worked as a teacher, an IT researcher and a bus driver.  The Tory candidate is Serena Farrow, who according to her Twitter is a BBC journalist, author, business/social networker and fairground owner.  Completing the ballot paper are George Howe for the Green Party, Louise Peace for the Lib Dems and independent candidate Jackie McDonald.
