<h2>ABBEY</h2>
Bath and North East Somerset council; caused by the resignation of Green Party councillor Jonathan Carr who is moving away from the city.  He had served since 2015.

Not many wards in the UK can lay claim to two World Heritage Sites, but Bath's Abbey ward can.  This is the centre of the city of Bath, originally a city known as Aquae Sulis and founded by the Romans, who built a bath complex around a hot spring which is still well-preserved today.  With the withdrawal of the Romans from Britain a monastery was founded - by St David, according to legend, but by King Osric of Hwicce in 675 according to records.  The church was rebuilt in 781 by King Offa of Mercia, and was the location for the first modern English coronation - of King Edgar in 973; the modern church dates from the sixteenth century, survived the dissolution of the monasteries to become the city's parish church and was extensively restored in Victorian times by Sir George Gilbert Scott, who installed fan vaulting above the nave.

However, the true beauty of Bath's architecture comes not from the Abbey but from the Georgian period, in which the city as we know it was developed in the golden Bath stone as a spa town fashionable with the upper classes thanks to a lively social circle presided over by MC Richard "Beau" Nash.  Many of the features of the modern Abbey ward, such as the Pump Rooms, the Assembly Rooms, the Circus and the Pulteney Bridge, date from this period, as do literature set in the town such as Jane Austen's Northanger Abbey and Persuasion and Sheridan's The Rivals.  One recent and rather controversial addition to the town is the Thermae Bath Spa, a modern building in which people can "take the waters" in much the same way as the Romans and Georgians did.  At the south end of the ward lies Bath Spa railway station, home to the ward's other World Heritage Site - the Great Western Railway - while over the Pulteney Bridge can be found the Recreation Ground, home to Bath's successful rugby union team.

Abbey ward makes the top 100 wards in England and Wales for private renting (46.5% of households) and Buddhism (1.7% of the population).  It is a solidly middle-class ward dominated by students at the city's two universities; 51% of the workforce are educated to degree level and a further 17% are studying for one.  Since students tend not to vote in local elections this translated during the Blair and Brown years into a Tory-Lib Dem marginal; the Conservatives won both seats in 2003 but lost one to the Lib Dems in 2011.  The 2015 local elections being held at general election time brought the students out, and they gave a seat to the single Green Party candidate who gained the Lib Dem seat; vote shares were 31% for the Conservatives, 28% for the Greens, 21% for the Lib Dems and 17% for Labour, so with the Greens having a generally poor by-election record a number of parties will fancy their chances of making a gain here.

Defending for the Green Party is Vipul Patel, who is described as a local businessman.  The Tory candidate is Lizzie Gladwyn, who works on Bath Spa University's outreach programme and is described as a community activist and campaigner on mental health issues.  The Lib Dems have selected Gerry Curran, a long-serving former councillor who lost his seat in Twerton ward last year.  Vicky Drew, described as a single working mother and passionate campaigner, is the Labour candidate.  Also standing are independent candidate Jenny Knight, who came last here last year, and Marc Hooper for UKIP.

<h2>HALDENS</h2>
Welwyn Hatfield council, Hertfordshire; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Malcolm Spinks on health grounds.  He had served only since May.

http://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/welwyn-hatfield-haldens.png

From an icon of history we move to Welwyn Garden City.  Entirely built in the twentieth century, WGC was both a garden city (the second to be founded) and a New Town, and Haldens ward, located on the northern edge of town east of the railway line, is one of the New Town bits.  It still has fairly high levels of social renting, but WGC's strong economy means that employment is high; Haldens ward includes the head offices of Tesco and PayPoint and a major Roche Pharmaceuticals centre.  One major local controversy is the future of Panshanger Aerodrome, just outside this ward, which is slated for substantial amounts of new housing.

The Local Government Boundary Commission seems to have trouble getting its head around Welwyn Hatfield council, with new ward boundaries being introduced in May this year to replace a set which came in only in 2008.  This means that May's result isn't comparable to previous results for Haldens ward, although it's fair to say that former versions of the ward were Labour-inclined except for the period 2006-10 when the Conservatives won.  By 2014 Labour had recovered all three seats for Haldens ward, but they held on by only 16 votes in 2015 and favourable boundary changes (in which the ward gained territory from the safe Conservative Panshanger ward) this year meant that the Tories won two of the three seats for the new ward.  Despite this, a personal vote for Labour's Mike Larkins meant that the Labour slate topped the poll (with 37%, to 36% for the Conservatives and 15% for the Greens).  The Tories narrowly hold the Haldens county council seat, which is larger than this ward and includes more of Panshanger.

So, a key marginal ward for the Tories to defend.  They have chosen Nathaniel Chapman, who fought WGC's Peartree ward in May.  On the Labour side, former Welwyn Hatfield councillor Astrid Thorpe (Hollybush ward, 2014-16) is seeking to return to the council after losing her seat in May.  The Green Party have reselected their candidate from May Lynne Allison, and Lib Dem Anthony Dennis completes the ballot paper.

<h2>MISTERTON</h2>
Harborough council, Leicestershire; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor John Everett who is moving away from the area.  A retired teacher who had also run a computer business, he had served since winning a by-election in March 2006 and was chairman of Harborough council in 2012-13.

Having covered this week's two urban by-elections we now turn to the two rural by-elections.  Our English rural by-election this week is in Leicestershire, covering seven parishes to the north-east, east and south of Lutterworth.  Despite the ward name, the largest parish within the ward is Gilmorton, north-east of Lutterworth; Misterton isn't even the largest village in its own parish, dwarfed by the neighbouring Walcote.  The most notorious location within the ward is probably Catthorpe which gives its name to a major road junction - now in the final throes of reconstruction - at which the M1, M6 and A14 roads meet.  The good motorway links attract some commuters to Leicester and other Midlands cities, and give the ward a middle-class demographic.

Misterton ward's politics are true blue.  Everett was unopposed at his first re-election in 2007 and in 2015 he beat Labour 75-25 in a straight fight.  The local county division (Bruntingthorpe) is also safely Conservative.

Defending for the Tories is Jonathan Bateman, a Broughton Astley parish councillor.  Labour have reselected Liz Marsh, a teacher and vice-chair of Misterton with Walcote parish council.  Also standing are Bill Piper for UKIP and Martin Sarfas for the Lib Dems.

<h2>ANNANDALE NORTH</h2>
Dumfries and Galloway council; caused by the resignation of Graeme Tait who had been elected as a Conservative councillor but had defected to Labour.  He had served since winning a by-election in November 2012; his resignation came in order to concentrate on his career, but he had not attended a council meeting since April and was about to be disqualified under the six-month non-attendance rule.

For our second rural by-election of the week we are in Scotland.  The Annandale North ward covers a large chunk of the Scottish borderland, from Lockerbie in the south to Moffat in the north.  Lockerbie will forever be associated with the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 just before Christmas 1988, but it deserves to be remembered for more than that; essentially an eighteenth-century planned settlement on the road from Glasgow to London, the town was once the location of Scotland's largest lamb market and was home to the Marquesses of Queensbury, whose legacy is the standard rules for boxing.  Further up Annandale on the long climb towards Beattock Summit is Moffat, another former wooltrade centre which was also known as a spa town and for toffee, while other settlements within the ward include Beattock, Wamphray and Lochmaben.

Upper Annandale is dominated politically by the Mundell family, who live in the area.  David Mundell, a local lad and postgraduate student, was elected in 1984 as an SDP candidate to the former Annandale and Eskdale district council, defeating independent councillor Sir William Jardine in Dryfe ward, and was then elected in 1986 to Dumfries and Galloway regional council from Mid Annandale.  After standing down from both councils, he returned to politics in 1999 being elected as a Conservative member of the Scottish Parliament, transferring to Westminster in 2005 as MP for Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale.  Since 2005 Mundell has been the only Conservative MP in Scotland, from 2015 onwards he has sat in the Cabinet as Scottish secretary, and in 2016 he became the first Conservative cabinet minister to come out as gay.  Mundell has passed on his passion for politics to his son Oliver, who represents the ward as part of the Dumfriesshire constituency in the Scottish Parliament.

This is no mean feat in the face of the recent SNP surge in Scotland, and reflects the fact that upper Annandale is a very Tory area.  In the 2003 elections - under the old first-past-the-post system - the Tories carried both Lockerbie wards and Moffat with Lochmaben voting Lib Dem.  In 2007 under PR the Tories tried to defend their three seats but lost their third seat to Labour and were rather fortunate to hold on to two, the second Tory candidate finishing just 25 votes ahead of independent candidate Billy Lockhart who had got transfers from a second independent and the SNP, but not quite enough transfers to win.  There was another narrow result in May 2012 in which the Lib Dem vote collapsed and their seat went to the SNP, but the SNP finished only 41 votes ahead of the Green Party candidate Alis Ballance, with 34 Tory surplus votes still to transfer which meant the real margin was even closer; shares of the vote were 40% for the Conservatives, 20% for Labour, 17% for the SNP and 14% for the Greens.

The Labour councillor for Annandale North died shortly afterwards, after being suddenly taken ill during a council meeting, and a by-election was held in November 2012 which resulted in an easy Tory gain, the first preferences splitting 46% Conservative, 25% Labour and 12% Green Party and the Tories reaching 50% before the Greens were eliminated.  As stated, the by-election winner Graeme Tait has since defected to Labour as part of a general split in the Conservative group which has brought down the Tory-SNP coalition formed in 2012; the present administration is a coalition of Labour and independent councillors.

Defending for Labour is 20-year-old Adam Wilson, an Edinburgh University student from Lochmaben.  The Tories want their seat back and have selected Douglas Fairbairn.  The Green Party candidate is Chris Ballance, a former MSP (South of Scotland, 2003-07) and award-winning playwright.  Completing the ballot paper is Sylvia Moffat, of Moffat, a Moffat and District community councillor, standing for the SNP.
