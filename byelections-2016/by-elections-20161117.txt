Not many wards in the UK can lay claim to two World Heritage Sites, but Bath's Abbey ward can.  This is the centre of the city of Bath, originally a city known as Aquae Sulis and founded by the Romans, who built a bath complex around a hot spring which is still well-preserved today.  With the withdrawal of the Romans from Britain a monastery was founded - by St David, according to legend, but by King Osric of Hwicce in 675 according to records.  The church was rebuilt in 781 by King Offa of Mercia, and was the location for the first modern English coronation - of King Edgar in 973; the modern church dates from the sixteenth century, survived the dissolution of the monasteries to become the city's parish church and was extensively restored in Victorian times by Sir George Gilbert Scott, who installed fan vaulting above the nave.

However, the true beauty of Bath's architecture comes not from the Abbey but from the Georgian period, in which the city as we know it was developed in the golden Bath stone as a spa town fashionable with the upper classes thanks to a lively social circle presided over by MC Richard "Beau" Nash.  Many of the features of the modern Abbey ward, such as the Pump Rooms, the Assembly Rooms, the Circus and the Pulteney Bridge, date from this period, as do literature set in the town such as Jane Austen's Northanger Abbey and Persuasion and Sheridan's The Rivals.  One recent and rather controversial addition to the town is the Thermae Bath Spa, a modern building in which people can "take the waters" in much the same way as the Romans and Georgians did.  At the south end of the ward lies Bath Spa railway station, home to the ward's other World Heritage Site - the Great Western Railway - while over the Pulteney Bridge can be found the Recreation Ground, home to Bath's successful rugby union team.

Abbey ward makes the top 100 wards in England and Wales for private renting (46.5% of households) and Buddhism (1.7% of the population).  It is a solidly middle-class ward dominated by students at the city's two universities; 51% of the workforce are educated to degree level and a further 17% are studying for one.  Since students tend not to vote in local elections this translated during the Blair and Brown years in a Tory-Lib Dem marginal; the Conservatives won both seats in 2003 but lost one to the Lib Dems in 2011.  The 2015 local elections being held at general election time brought the students out, and they gave a seat to the single Green Party candidate who gained the Lib Dem seat; vote shares were 31% for the Conservatives, 28% for the Greens, 21% for the Lib Dems and 17% for Labour, so with the Greens have a generally poor by-election record a number of parties will fancy their chances of making a gain here.

Defending for the Green Party is Vipul Patel, who is described as a local businessman.  The Tory candidate is Lizzie Gladwyn, who works on Bath Spa University's outreach programme and is described as a community activist and campaigner on mental health issues.  The Lib Dems have selected Gerry Curran, a long-serving former councillor who lost his seat in Twerton ward last year.  Vicky Drew, described as a single working mother and passionate campaigner, is the Labour candidate.  Also standing are independent candidate Jenny Knight, who came last here last year, and Marc Hooper for UKIP.

<h2>HALDENS</h2>
Welwyn Hatfield council, Hertfordshire; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Malcolm Spinks on health grounds.  He had served only since May.

http://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/welwyn-hatfield-haldens.png

From an icon of history we move to Welwyn Garden City.  Entirely built in the twentieth century, WGC was both a garden city (the second to be founded) and a New Town, and Haldens ward, located on the northern edge of town east of the railway line, is one of the New Town bits.  It still has fairly high levels of social renting, but WGC's strong economy means that employment is high; Haldens ward includes the head offices of Tesco and PayPoint and a major Roche Pharmaceuticals centre.  One major local controversy is the future of Panshanger Aerodrome, just outside this ward, which is slated for substantial amounts of new housing.

The Local Government Boundary Commission seems to have trouble getting its head around Welwyn Hatfield council, with new ward boundaries being introduced in May this year to replace a set which came in only in 2008.  This means that May's result isn't comparable to previous results for Haldens ward, although it's fair to say that former versions of the ward were Labour-inclined except for the period 2006-10 when the Conservatives won.  By 2014 Labour had recovered all three seats for Haldens ward, but they held on by only 16 votes in 2015 and favourable boundary changes (in which the ward gained territory from the safe Conservative Panshanger ward) this year meant that the Tories won two of the three seats for the new ward.  Despite this, a personal vote for Labour's Mike Larkins meant that the Labour slate topped the poll (with 37%, to 36% for the Conservatives and 15% for the Greens).  The Tories narrowly hold the Haldens county council seat, which is larger than this ward and includes more of Panshanger.

So, a key marginal ward for the Tories to defend.  They have chosen Nathaniel Chapman, who fought WGC's Peartree ward in May.  On the Labour side, former Welwyn Hatfield councillor Astrid Thorpe (Hollybush ward, 2014-16) is seeking to return to the council after losing her seat in May.  The Green Party have reselected their candidate from May Lynne Allison, and Lib Dem Anthony Dennis completes the ballot paper.
