Fifty years ago today Harold Wilson won his landslide, his biggest majority of 96 coming in the 1966 general election.  These days Wilson's Labour successors aren't doing quite so well, and they have few prospects of a gain among this week's by-elections although they should hold a safe seat in the South Wales Valleys (covered on Welsh Elections).  Over on Scottish Elections the SNP should have little trouble holding a seat in one of the strongest pro-independence areas of Scotland, while in England the Tories and Lib Dems both have seats to defend in the Yorkshire Dales.  But we start this week with an open seat in UKIP's strongest area of the country...

Five by-elections on 31st March 2016:

CLACTON EAST, Essex county council; caused by the disqualification of Tendring First councillor Pierre Oxley, after he pleaded guilty to fraud by false representation and was sentenced to two years in prison, suspended for one year.  As the chairman of Clacton Sports Club, Oxley had forged invoices to persuade his own council, Sport England and the Big Lottery Fund to pay out grants of £95,000 for capital work which was never carried out, Oxley instead using the money to meet the club's running costs.  The court heard that Oxley, a former cabinet member on Tendring district council, had not personally profited from the fraud.

It's after Easter, the weather's foul, so it must be time for a trip to the seaside.  The Clacton East division covers the eastern end of the Clacton seafront, including the suburb of Holland-on-Sea, together with the Great Clacton area to the north of the town centre.  This is retirement ghettoland and economically depressed, and as such perfect conditions to elect a UKIP MP, which Clacton as a whole has done twice in the last two years.

But dig down into this corner of Carswell-land and it all starts to get a bit more confusing.  Pierre Oxley was first elected to Essex county council from this division in 2005, winning easily as a Conservative candidate.  By 2009 he had defected to Tendring First, one of several competing localist groups in this obscure corner of Essex, and stood for re-election under his new colours, losing 43-26 to the new Conservative candidate Linda Mead; a third-place 12% for the BNP that year was an early demonstration that there is a populist right-wing vote here.  In the 2013 county election Oxley improved his vote to 34%, and that was enough to regain his seat as the Tory vote was split by UKIP, the Tories taking second place 27-25.  That was of course, before the Clacton by-election which resulted in Britain's first UKIP MP elected as such.

A look at the district council results for 2015 only serves to confuse the issue: of the four Tendring wards within the division, two are dominated by the Holland-on-Sea Residents Association, St Marys ward (covering Great Clacton) voted UKIP, and St Pauls ward (the part of the seafront nearest the town centre) split UKIP/Tory in 2015, but the UKIP councillor for that ward has decided to emigrate and a by-election for that seat is pending.  Overall UKIP came in second to the Tories in the 2015 Tendring council elections; in an inspired move, the Tendring Tories offered UKIP a coalition deal and Tendring UKIP promptly split over whether to accept it. Those councillors who ended up in the administration were expelled from the UKIP group which has since suffered further defections and problems.

Although Tendring First still exist as an elected force (they have a district councillor) they are not defending this seat which is up for grabs.  The Tory candidate Richard Bleach, whose Twitter profile disclaims "All views my own, normally moronic", stood for the district council last year.  UKIP's candidate is Ben Smith, who gives an address some distance away in Brightlingsea.  Labour have selected Christopher Bird, the Lib Dems Rain Welham-Cobb and the Holland-on-Sea Residents Association have entered the fray, selecting Colin Sargeant.

EMBSAY-WITH-EASTBY, Craven district council, North Yorkshire; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Andy Quinn at the age of 65.  He had served as a councillor since 2002 and was chairman of Craven council in 2011/12.  Away from the council he had taught carpentry and joinery at the former Keighley College following a career in the military, and right up to his death was working as a lecturer and a health and safety consultant.

England's other two by-elections this week both take place in the Yorkshire Dales.  We start with Embsay, a village just to the north-east of Skipton best known for steam; it is the western terminus of the Embsay and Bolton Abbey Steam Railway, a preserved line linking the village with (surprisingly) Bolton Abbey.  The ward also includes the village of Eastby and part of the Yorkshire Dales National Park.

Embsay-with-Eastby ward goes all the way back to the founding electoral arrangements of Craven district council in 1973 and only minor changes have been made since then (consequential on changes to the parish boundary).  It has been held by the Conservatives continuously since 1979 and was regularly uncontested in the 1980s and 1990s.  Quinn's final re-election came in May last year when he beat Labour 59-22.  The Tories also hold the local county council seat (Mid Craven).

Defending for the Tories is Trevor Kent, a retired baker and electrician.  He is opposed by an independent candidate, the Embsay-wth-Eastby parish council chairman Brian Shuttleworth.

RICHMOND CENTRAL, Richmondshire district council, North Yorkshire; caused by the death of Liberal Democrat councillor John Robinson at the age of 63.  A fireman for 32 years, he had served on Richmond town council since 2003 and Richmondshire district council since 2007; he was Mayor of Richmond in 2007/8.

For our second Dales by-election of the week we move from Airedale to Swaledale and the town of Richmond.  Just outside the National Park, Richmond is a town whose greatest prosperity came before the Industrial Revolution as it was the marketplace for Swaledale wool and Arkengarthdale lead.  Today its economy is based on tourism and the military, and despite its relative isolation the town is still important enough to give its name to a parliamentary constituency.  The Richmond Central ward is rather misnamed; while it is the central of the three wards covering the town it only contains the eastern edge of the well-preserved town centre, which is mostly in Richmond West ward.

Richmond Central ward had elected two Liberal Democrats at every election this century but always with small majorities - John Robinson's majority was 15 votes in 2007 and 22 votes in 2011.  In that context the Lib Dem performance at the most recent election in 2015 - where they had 49% to 30% for the Tories and 22% for the Green Party - was impressive, although it remains to be seen how much of that was due to personalities in this tiny local government district.  Going up to county level only serves to confuse the issue, as the town's former Lib Dem county councillor was easily re-elected in 2013 under the label "Save the Friarage Hospital" and was not opposed by the Lib Dems that time.

Defending for the Liberal Democrats is Philip Knowles, a marketing consultant who last year fought his home ward (Newsham with Eppleby) and got nowhere.  The Tories have selected Nathalie Carter.  Anna Jackson stands for the Green Party, and Richmondshire Independents candidate Lorraine Hodgson completes the ballot paper.

MORIAH, Caerphilly county borough council; caused by the death of Labour councillor Gina Bevan, who had served since 2012.

The last two electoral tests in Wales before the Welsh Assembly elections in May are two local by-elections in the County Borough of Caerphilly.  We shall come back next week for the second one in Ynysddu division, but this week we are in Moriah, the south-eastern ward covering the town of Rhymney high up in the Valleys.  Moriah ward is on the east side of the valley covering much of Rhymney proper together with Abertysswg to the south, a turn-of-the-century village brought into existence by its pit, as with much of the Valleys.  With coalmining extinct in the Rhymney area all the usual problems exist, and Moriah is in the top 25 wards in the country for long-term sickness and disability (14% of the workforce).

The ward is as safe Labour as you might expect for an ex-coalmining area, and at the most recent local elections in 2012 Labour had 47% here to 28% for Plaid and 25% for an independent.

Defending for Labour is David Harse, the leader of Rhymney town council.  Despite their second place Plaid are not contesting this by-election; instead the opposition to Labour comes from independent candidates Peter Bailie and Mervyn Diggle, Nigel Godfrey who has somehow found ten people to nominate him as the Conservative candidate, and Ian Gorman of UKIP.

MARYFIELD, Dundee city council; caused by the resignation of SNP councillor Craig Melville as a result of a row over alleged racist and Islamophobic texts.  He had served since winning a by-election in March 2009.

This week's Scottish by-election comes from the centre of Dundee.  Maryfield ward contains Dundee city centre, the Abertay University campus, the end of the Tay Road Bridge and the city's docks, running north from the docks to take in the area around Baxter and Stobsmuir Parks as far as the Kingsway.

Before PR was introduced most of this area was in just two single-member wards: Baxter Park (which was safe SNP) and East Port (an SNP/Labour marginal).  With the introduction of PR in 2007 Maryfield became a three-seat ward with two safe seats for the SNP and one for Labour, the SNP winning the first preferences 51-36 at the most recent election in 2012.

With the general swing to the SNP since 2012 and the good Yes performance in Dundee in the referendum, it's hard to see beyond the SNP's Lynne Short for this by-election.  Labour's Alan Cowan, a Unison and GMB activist will be hoping for a gain which would cut the SNP majority on the city council to one.  Also standing are James Clancy for the Tories, Christopher McIntyre for the Lib Dems, Stuart Fairweather for the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition, Jacob Ellis for the Greens, independent candidate Brian McLeod and UKIP's Calum Walker.

Parliamentary constituencies: Dundee East (part formerly in Baxter Park and East Port wards); Dundee West (part formerly in Stobswell and Tay Bridges wards)
