One by-election on Tuesday 20th September 2016:

PLASNEWYDD, Cardiff council; caused by the death of Labour councillor Mohammad Javed at the age of 76.  Although he had only been a councillor since 2012, Javed was a pillar of the ward's Pakistani and Muslim community; he had run a shop on Albany Road and been a governor at a local primary school.

For an unusual Tuesday by-election we are just north-east of Cardiff city centre.  Plasnewydd ("New Manor") ward covers much of Roath, an area of Victorian terracing from Cardiff's first great expansion along City Road and Albany Road.  Many of these terraced houses are now in multiple occupation - not by immigrants in the normal sense, although the ward is unusually ethnically diverse by Welsh standards (15% Asian, 11% Muslim), but by students at Cardiff's universities.  The sheer number of student rents within the ward places Plasnewydd in the top 25 wards in England and Wales for privately rented households (55%), and the ward is also in the top 100 for full-time students (33% of the workforce) and people in the 18-29 age bracket (50% of the population).  Or, at least, that's the case during term time, and Cardiff University's new academic year doesn't start until next week.

The fact that most of the students are away could have an interesting effect on this ward.  Plasnewydd was a safe Lib Dem ward while the party were running Cardiff council in the Noughties and will have been one of the bedrocks for the party's majority in the Cardiff Central constituency during that period.  Although Labour gained all four seats in the 2012 election, their majority was not large (37% to 33% for the Lib Dem slate and 13% for a single Green candidate) and the Lib Dem vote in Cardiff Central held up relatively well in May's Assembly elections, suggesting that the party is still in rude health.

Both the Labour and Lib Dem candidates were major behind-the-scenes figures in that campaign.  The defending Labour candidate Peter Wong, a civil servant with the Valuation Office Agency, is the chairman of the party's Cardiff Central branch and also sits on the board of Chinese for Labour.  The Lib Dems have selected party staffer Robin Rea.  The Green candidate is Michael Cope, and the ballot paper - a much shorter one than in 2012, when there were seventeen candidates chasing four seats - is completed by Munawar Mughal for the Tories and Lawrence Gwynn for UKIP.

Nine by-elections on Thursday 22nd September 2016:

COATBRIDGE NORTH AND GLENBOIG, North Lanarkshire council; caused by the resignation of SNP councillor Fulton MacGregor, who is now the MSP for Coatbridge and Chryston.  He had served since 2012.

Welcome to the town which won the 2007 Carbuncle award for being the most dismal town in Scotland, and was once described by Frankie Boyle as "Blade Runner without the special effects".  Coatbridge did not exist before the nineteenth century, developing very quickly during the Industrial Revolution as a coalmining and ironworking centre.  In order to develop so fast Coatbridge attracted a huge number of immigrants from Ireland, many of whom lived in overcrowded housing as bad as anything put up during the Industrial Revolution.  Coatbridge's industrial bust came rather quicker than most other post-industrial places: by 1920 the coal was gone, only one of the ironworks survived the Great Depression, and the development of a huge new steelworks in Corby during the mid-1930s led to an exodus from what was still, once all the people who went to Corby had gone, the most overcrowded town in Scotland.  Since the 1930s the town's housing and economic base has been extensively redevloped; distribution is now the main game in town, thanks to its location at the centre of the Central Belt with excellent road and rail links, and particularly given that the town's other major employer - the Tannoy loudspeaker factory - is now closing down.  Today the only remaining vestiges of Coatbridge's heavy industrial past are the Museum of Scottish Industrial Life, located within this ward on the site of a former blast furnace, and a very large Catholic population of Irish descent.  This is one of three wards covering the town, and also includes a rural area to the north including the village of Glenboig and running up to the edge of Cumbernauld.

The local government reorganisation of 1975 grouped Coatbridge with the mainly Protestant town of Airdire under what was then Monklands district council.  That led to one of the more bizarre local government scandals of the 1990s, "Monklandsgate", in which allegations were made that council spending had sectarian discrepancies in favour of Coatbridge - as evidence for this it was pointed out that the council's entire ruling Labour group were Roman Catholic.  Although nothing came of this allegations of nepotism were upheld (a large number of council workers were related to Labour councillors).  The whole story gained added spice by the fact that Airdrie's MP was the party leader John Smith, while Coatbridge's MP was Tom Clarke, the shadow Scottish secretary; after Smith died the scandal led to Labour nearly losing the resulting by-election in Airdrie.  Coatbridge, however, continued to give Clarke large majorities.

PR was introduced for Scottish local elections in 2007, and the 2007 election to this ward returned two Labour councillors, one SNP councillor (John Wilson, who topped the poll) and a left-wing independent candidate called Martin McWilliams, who overtook the Tories on transfers from the Scottish Socialist Party and benefited from the SNP only running one candidate.  Wilson had simultaneously been elected to Holyood from the Central Scotland list, and stood down from North Lanarkshire council in 2009 to focus on his duties in Edinburgh; in the resulting by-election the SNP narrowly lost their seat to Labour.  A second by-election was held in 2011 after Labour councillor Tony Clarke (Tom Clarke MP's brother) died, and Labour held this more comfortably.  Coincidentally, in both by-elections Labour polled the same number of first-prefeence votes - 1,529.  The SNP made a comeback in the 2012 council election, recovering their by-election loss from Labour (who didn't defend it) and also narrowly knocking out independent councillor McWilliams to leave the ward with a 2-2 split; on first preferences Labour led 53-31.

2012 is a long time ago in Scottish politics, which is still reverberating from the 2014 independence referendum in which Coatbridge voted strongly Yes, a presage of the collapse of Labour's support among Catholics in the central belt.  One of the more surprising aspects of the defeat for independence was that John Wilson MSP left the SNP, having fallen out with the party over the issue of NATO membership for an independent Scotland.  Since 2014 the SNP have gained the Coatbridge constituency at both Westminster and Holyrood level, resulting in this by-election.

With the favourable tailwind for the SNP generally a hold in this by-election would be an easy prediction; but there are some straws in the wind which suggest that the Nationalists might find this heavy going.  Firstly, the SNP's Coatbridge branch has been suspended for several months for severe Monklandsgatestyle infighting; a peace meeting between the two factions earlier this month was reportedly patrolled by bouncers.  Perhaps because of this, the SNP candidate Stephen Kirley has resorted to Crowdfunder to raise money for his campaign.  The hot local issue of the moment appears to be a row over services being moved away from Monklands hospital; it must not be forgotten that health is a devolved issue and Labour's candidate Alex McVey is milking this for all it's worth.  Finally, the former MSP John Wilson is seeking a return to the council as a Scottish Green Party candidate; he sought re-election to Holyrood under that label in May and saved his deposit in Coatbridge and Chryston, giving him a higher profile than the only previous Green candidate for this ward (Kristofer Keane, who stood here in the 2009 by-election and later hosted this column for several years).  As this by-election is under the Alternative Vote, transfers from whoever finishes third could be very important in deciding the result.  Completing the ballot paper are Ben Callaghan for the Tories and Neil Wilson for UKIP.

CHOPWELL AND ROWLANDS GILL, Gateshead council, Tyne and Wear; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor John Hamilton who had served since 2000.

Moving into England but staying in the coalfield.  Despite the order of the names, Rowlands Gill is the larger of the two villages in this ward, perhaps being most notable for having no licensed premises (an effect of the previous landowner, the Church of England, putting a covenant on the land when the village was developed) and for being the birthplace of former SAS soldier Chris Ryan.  One of the electors in this surprisingly rural ward, given its presence in the Tyne and Wear metropolitan county, is the hairy biker Si King.

If, as expected, Jeremy Corbyn is re-elected as Labour leader on Saturday then the people of Chopwell might well be pleased by that.  Chopwell was so left-wing during the inter-war years that it became known as "Little Moscow": the Soviet flag flew from the village's council offices during the General Strike, and there are still street names in Chopwell commemorating Marx and Lenin.  That left-wing nature has carried through into this ward's modern elections, which are safe Labour with little of interest.  In May Labour led UKIP here 63-14.

Defending for Labour is Dave Bradford, who is opposed by Ray Tolley for UKIP, John Lathan for the Tories, Green candidate Dave Castleton and Lib Dem Amelia Ord.

ARLEY AND WHITACRE, North Warwickshire council; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Andrew Watkins.  He had served since 2015.

For our final ex-coalfield by-election of the week we travel to an ex-coalfield of very recent vintage.  Daw Mill colliery, located in the Warwickshire parish of Arley north of Coventry, was the last deep coal mine in the Midlands, breaking the UK record for annual coal output by extracting 3.25 million tons in 2008.  Production was stopped in February 2013 due to a large underground fire, and never restarted.  650 jobs were lost.  Shortly afterwards the colliery site was bought from UK Coal's liquidators by a property development firm which wants to transform it into a business park and HGV depot.  There are obvious problems in siting an HGV depot at Daw Mill, most of whose coal left the site by rail; while the road running past the colliery once had the important number A51 (and there are still road signs in Coventry describing it as such) it was downgraded to a B-road decades ago and that's a decision which anyone who has visited the area will find it hard to argue with.  North Warwickshire council's planning committee threw out the business park plan last year, but the issue clearly hasn't gone away because Arley parish council is combining this by-eletcion with a referendum on the council's neighbourhood planning framework.

Arley and Whitacre does not vote how you would expect an ex-coalfield (or even an active coalfield) ward to vote, being instead a key marginal between Labour and the Conservatives - rather like the parliamentary seat in which it is presently sited, Nuneaton.  Like the Nuneaton seat, it is trending towards the Tories who returned a full slate in the 2015 election, narrowly gaining a seat from Labour; shares of the vote in May were 39% for the Tories, 26% for Labour and 23% for UKIP but the Tory share may well be inflated by a personal vote for Colin Hayfield, who is the ward's county councillor (and a relative of Harry Hayfield, who writes the by-election previews for Politicalbetting.com in rather less detail than you'd find here).

With UKIP withdrawing from the fray this by-election is a straight fight.  Defending in the blue corner is Karen Barber, a Tory councillor for this ward from 2011 to 2015.  Challenging in the red corner is Jodie Gosling, who is campaigning against council cuts to Arley sports centre.  Seconds out!

CHRISTCHURCH, Allerdale council, Cumbria; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Margaret Jackson who is moving to Lancashire.  First elected to Allerdale council in 1995, Jackson was a former deputy leader of the council and twice Mayor of Cockermouth.

After three coalfield wards, we now turn to a series of three wards which cover old but small market towns.  Christchurch ward covers the centre and western side of Cockermouth, a location which was important to the Romans as the lowest crossing point of the River Derwent; while it was traditionally a weaving and spinning town Cockermouth became a very early tourist destination thanks to the poetry of William Wordsworth, who was born here.  Tourism, along with farming and the superlative Jennings beer, keeps Cockermouth afloat today - and with the town having suffered three devastating floods in the last eleven years it needs as much tourist investment as it can get.

This is Cockermouth's Tory ward and is quite reliable for them, the party leading Labour 45-35 last year.  Interesting the largest Tory vote here in recent times came during the coalition years - the Tories won a by-election in August 2010 with 67% partly thanks to Labour failing to nominate a candidate.

Defending for the Tories is Simon Nicholson, a haulier and Cockermouth town councillor.  Labour have reselected Joan Ellis, who was runner-up here last year.  Also standing are Debbie Taylor for the Lib Dems and Eric Atkinson for UKIP.
