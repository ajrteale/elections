One by-election on Tuesday 26th July 2016:

THE HANGERS AND FOREST, East Hampshire council; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Judy Onslow at the age of 70.  First elected in 1999 for the former Hangers ward, Onslow was chairman of the council in 2010-11 and had also served as cabinet member for the environment.

It's a long-standing practice for elections in the UK to be held on Thursdays.  By law, ordinary local elections are on Thursdays unless otherwise provided for; the devolved institutions have electoral timetables based around Thursdays; and the recent Fixed Term Parliaments Act set the dates for ordinary general elections as Thursdays.  In fact, the only ordinary electoral event not tied to a Thursday is the European Parliament elections, although that might not be much of a problem for the UK in the near future.  By-elections, on the other hand, are not subject to the normal rules; any ordinary working day will do.  So it is that two of this week's seven by-elections are not on a Thursday, starting with this Tuesday poll in Hampshire.

The Hangers and Forest is one of the more rural wards of one of Hampshire's more rural districts.  The Hangers themselves are a range of low but steep hills which mark the eastern end of the Hampshire Downs, while the Forest is Liss Forest, a hamlet surrounded by forest land used as a military training site.  Apart from Liss Forest, the main centres of population are Greatham (pronounced Grettm) on the old Farnham-Petersfield road, and Hawkley.  The entire ward lies within the South Downs national park, and its location on the A3 London-Portsmouth road gives it a commuter economic profile.

Onslow held a safe Conservative seat; she was unopposed in 2003 and at her last re-election in 2015 had 69% of the vote, with an independent candidate coming second on 18%.  The Tories also have little trouble in the local county division (Petersfield Hangers).

The defending Tory candidate is Keith Budden, chairman of Liss parish council which covers Liss Forest.  The independent candidate from 2015 is not standing again, but the Labour candidate from 2015 (Neil Owsnett) is.  Don Jerrard, who was Onslow's only opposition in 2007 and 2011, stands for his own Justice and Anti-Corruption Party, and the Lib Dems' Roger Mullenger completes the ballot paper.

One by-election on Wednesday 27th July 2016:

TOTNES, South Hams council, Devon; caused by the resignation of David Horsburgh who was the only Labour member of the council.  A Totnes town councillor for 24 years, and twice Mayor of Totnes, but a district councillor only since May last year, Horsburgh's resignation came due to work and family commitments.

The town of Totnes has a large amount of myth and legend around it - going back to Brutus of Troy and Uther Pendragon - but its attested history begins in 907 when King Edward the Elder fortified it.  The town quickly became an important market town thanks to its location at the lowest bridging point of the navigable River Dart, and being on one of the major ancient roads through the West Country, and by 1523 was assessed by the Exchequer as the sixteenth richest town in England - ahead of major cities such as Worcester, Gloucester and Lincoln.  Although Totnes is no longer on the main road through the South West, it is a stop on the Great Western main line from London to Plymouth. Today Totnes is probably better known for its bohemian lifestyle, being declared by Time magazine in 2007 to be the capital of New Age chic; a large number of artists and musicians live here.

South Hams was re-warded last year, and the current Totnes ward is a straight merger of the former Totnes Bridgetown and Totnes Town wards; Bridgetown returned an independent and a Lib Dem councillor from 2003 to 2011, while Town split Lib Dem/Labour in 2003, returned two Lib Dems in 2007 and two Green councillors narrowly in 2011; one of the Green councillors had been elected as a Lib Dem in 2007.  At the last ordinary election in 2015 the ward was safe Green with the Green Party slate polling 34%; however, they stood only two candidates for the three available seats, and Labour (19%) narrowly beat the Lib Dems (17%) and Tories (14%) for the final seat.  One of the two Green councillors resigned shortly after his election on health grounds, and the Greens held the by-election last October but by just 12 votes over the Lib Dems; shares of the vote in a fragmented election were 30% each for the Greens and Lib Dems, 23% for Labour and 14% for the Conservatives.

Two things have happened during this by-election campaign to suggest a very different result this time.  Firstly, Labour are not defending this by-election and the seat is up for grabs.  Secondly, the town's Green Party county councillor Robert Vint (the Greens have held the county seat here since 2009), who is also a district councillor for the ward, defected to the Lib Dems during the by-election campaign.  With local MP Sarah Wollaston having prominently defected from Leave to Remain during the referendum campaign, and this poll being combined with no fewer than four by-elections to Totnes town council following a rash of resignations, clearly political instability is the order of the day here.  Perhaps a series of poor omens for the new Green candidate Alan White, a potter working at Dartington Pottery.  The Lib Dems' John Birch, a solicitor and travel blogger, hopes to make it third time lucky after being runner-up in both 2015 elections.  The Tories have selected party staffer and Vote Leave campaigner Andrew Barrand, who gives an address in Paignton; he will be hoping that nobody remembers the 2013 Surrey County Council election in which he was the election agent responsible for losing the Tories a safe seat by missing the nomination deadline.  Completing the ballot paper is 18-year-old Alex Mockridge; she is standing as an independent.

Five by-elections on Thursday 28th July 2016, four in England (two of which are in London) and one in Wales.  In contrast to last week's procession of mostly safe seats (although there was an unexpected Lib Dem gain in Northampton), today's crop has something for everyone.  There is a Labour defence in London where the party will be looking to see off the Lib Dem threat, and Labour also have clear opportunities to make gains in Newport, where the Lib Dems are defending their last seat on the council and a majority of one vote, and in Worcestershire where the Tories are defending a key marginal ward.  The Conservatives are also in some trouble in their other defence in Cornwall, where they are under pressure from the Cornish nationalists.  But first up today is a Lib Dem defence in South London which might not be as safe as it looks on paper...

CARSHALTON CENTRAL, Sutton council, South London; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Alan Salter, who had served since 2010.  An accountant, his resignation came amid allegations of financial irregularities; Salter has since been arrested on suspicion of fraud by false representation, and police investigations are ongoing.

Now here's a rare sight - a by-election in a Liberal Democrat-held parliamentary seat.  We're in Carshalton, a picturesque Surrey village built around two ponds which has been swallowed up by the growth of London.  Carshalton's economy was traditionally based on lavender, but with no land left for lavender fields the area now has a commuter profile, with Carshalton station (on the Victoria-Mitcham-Sutton and Wimbledon Loop lines) and Carshalton Beeches station (on the Victoria-West Croydon-Sutton line) linking the ward to central London; since Southern Railway run most of the constituency's trains transport is probably a major political issue at the moment.

The Lib Dems have had a lock on Sutton council since 1990, with the biggest recent Tory challenge coming in the 2006 election when they gained two of the three seats in Carshalton Central, but the Lib Dems recovered those gains in 2010.  At the most recent London borough elections in 2014 the Lib Dem slate won with 38%, to 25% for the Tories, 16% for a single UKIP candidate and 9% for the Labour slate; in the London mayoral election in May Zac Goldsmith had 43% to 29% for Sadiq Khan and 14% for the Lib Dems' Caroline Pidgeon, while the Lib Dems were a rare second in the London Members ballot with 22%, to 32% for the Tories, 20% for Labour and 11% for UKIP.

By-elections where the previous councillor resigned under a cloud are often tricky defences.  Chris Williams, a recently-retired teacher, has the task of defending this seat for the Lib Dems.  His main opposition will probably come from the Tory candidate Melissa Pearce, a civil engineering manager.  The UKIP candidate is Bill Main-Ian, a former royal protection police officer and wheelchair user who chairs the party's Sutton branch and stood here in last year's general election.  Labour have selected Sarah Gwynn, who gives an address in Croydon but is described as an active campaigner.  Also standing are Ross Hemingway for the Green Party and Ashley Dickenson for the Christian Peoples Alliance.

HARRINGAY, Haringey council, North London; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor James Ryan who is taking up a new job in Sadiq Khan's administration at City Hall.  He had served only since 2014.

Our other London by-election of the week is a very different area to Carshalton.  Harringay ward is a long, thin ward bounded on the west side by the East Coast Main Line and on the east side by the high street of Green Lanes; since every other road within the ward runs west-east between the two the ward's street layout is known as the Harringay Ladder, a series of uniformly Victorian terraces.  The ward also includes Finsbury Park, one of London's great Victorian parks and home to the London Mets baseball team.  A quick look at the cosmppolitan Green Lanes will tell you that this area has been a major focus for immigration: Harringay ward is in the top 100 in England and Wales both for population born in the old EU states (8%) and in the new EU states (13%); not surprisingly therefore it is also in the top 100 for the White Other ethnic group (32%), for population aged between 30 and 44 (32%) and for private renting (46% of households); there is a large student population, employment is high and the employment profile is mixed.  When London-based politicians talk about immigration being positive for the economy, perhaps this is the sort of area they are thinking of.  The Ladder is served by no fewer than four stations, Harringay and Hornsey on the East Coast Main Line, Harringay Green Lanes on the Gospel Oak-Barking line (closed for electrification) and Turnpike Lane on the Piccadilly line of the Underground, while the park is served by Manor House station on the Piccadilly line and by the major transport interchange of Finsbury Park itself.

A safe Labour ward in 2002 with evenly-split opposition, Harringay was aggressively targeted by the Lib Dems in their 2006 assault on Haringey council which saw them top the poll across the borough but win fewer seats than Labour, who continued in office on the council.  The Lib Dems did gain two of the three seats in Harringay ward that year, held on to them in 2010 and weren't all that far off keeping hold of a seat in the 2014 election where Labour got their full slate back; shares of the vote that year were 43% for the Labour slate, 30% for the Lib Dems and 17% for the Greens.  However, the London Assembly poll in May provides Labour with grounds for optimism, with Sadiq Khan polling 61% here to 13% for the second-placed Green candidate Siân Berry, and Labour winning the London Members ballot with 50% to 19% for the Greens and 10% for the Conservatives, the Lib Dems actually finishing fifth behind the Women's Equality Party.

Defending for Labour is Zena Brabazon, a former Haringey councillor (for St Ann's ward in Tottenham) who was deselected for the 2014 election.  The Lib Dems have also selected a former Haringey councillor, Karen Alexander who represented this ward from 2006 to 2014.  The Green candidate is Jarelle Francis, a businesman in the fashion industry.  Also standing are Cansoy Elmaz for the Conservatives and Neville Watson for UKIP.

DROITWICH WEST, Wychavon council, Worcestershire; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Catherine Powell, who had served since 2015, due to work commitments.

Out of London, and we come to Worcestershire.  The Droitwich West ward consists of a series of entirely post-war council estates along the A38 Droitwich bypass, close to a large industrial estate at Berry Hill which provides employment for the area.  As a result the local employment base is working-class and geared towards manufacturing, and much of the housing is still socially rented.  However, the ward's good road connections to Worcester and Birmingham means there is a commuting element to the ward.  The ward has a relatively high population from the new EU states (just under 4% at the time of the last census).

This social profile makes the ward a key Labour/Tory marginal.  Labour did well here in the 2003 election, but the Tories narrowly gained both seats in 2007 (by majorities of 47 and 15 votes).  Labour got one seat back in 2011, but the 2015 result was another Tory sweep; shares of the vote were 45% for the Conservatives, 38% for Labour and 17% for a single Green Party candidate.  If Labour can get their act together under Corbyn, surely this should be a gain?

The Tories have gone for youth in defending this by-election; their candidate George Duffy is a 19-year-old farmworker.  The Labour candidate is Droitwich Spa town councillor Alan Humphries.  The Greens have not nominated a candidate, so the ballot paper is completed by Adrian Key of the Lib Dems and Andy Morgan of UKIP.

NEWLYN AND GOONHAVERN, Cornwall council; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Lisa Gorman, who had served since 2013.

It's worth saying a word about the number of Cornish by-elections.  This is the sixth so far this year with a seventh to come in September, which seems like a lot; but it must be remembered that Cornwall council is the fourth-largest elected body in the UK with 123 members - only Durham council, the Scottish Parliament and the House of Commons have a larger membership.  Cornwall council is twice the size of a small metropolitan borough and perhaps three times the size of the average English district council, so in that context seven by-elections in a year, while still quite a lot, is not excessive.

It's also worth saying a word about the name of Newlyn and Goonhavern division.  This is not the Newlyn which is a small fishing village outside Penzance known for its Ordnance Datum, from which all altitudes in the UK are measured.  Rather, this Newlyn refers to St Newlyn East, an inland village which forms the centre of a rural ward covering the countryside immediately to the south of Newquay, and the hills to the south of it on the A30 road called the Newlyn Downs.  This was traditionally a mining district, and in Victorian times the major employer was the East Wheal Rose lead mine - despite a disaster in 1846 when the mine was flooded by a thunderstorm.  St Newlyn East vies for the title of the ward's largest village with Cubert; also within the ward are Goonhavern and Crantock.  In summer the ward is filled with tourists, with attractions including the Lappa Valley steam railway and the Elizabethan manor Trerice House.  The electors of Mitchell, a small village on the A30, will no doubt be pleased to see that their polling station is a pub - the Plume of Feathers.

Before local government in Cornwall was reorganised in 2009 the Lib Dems had most of the county and district councillors for this area, so the Conservatives did well in 2009 to win here with a big majority over the Lib Dems.  There was a change of Conservative candidate for the 2013 election, and Lisa Shuttleworth (as she was then) held the seat only narrowly, beating the Cornish nationalist party Mebyon Kernow 46-44.

This by-election has a large field.  Defending for the Conservatives is Paul Charlesworth, finance officer and fundraiser for the charity Hearing Loss Cornwall.  Mebyon Kernow's Rod Toms stands again; he is a retired scientist and St Newlyn East parish councillor.  Also standing are Vicky Crowther for Labour, former Lib Dem councillor for much of the area Kenneth Yeo as an independent, two other independent candidates - Rob Thomas and James Tucker - and official Lib Dem candidate Maggie Vale.

ST JULIANS, Newport council, South Wales; caused by the death of councillor Ed Townsend, who was the only Liberal Democrat member of the council, at the age of 64.  A former journalist with the Birkenhead Post and the Daily Mail, Townsend came to Wales as head of corporate relations for BT.  He was first elected to Newport council in 2004, and was the council's cabinet member for economic regeneration from 2008 to 2012 and deputy leader of the council from 2008 to 2011.  He is survived by his wife Carmel, six children and two grandchildren.

You're not from Newport.  You've probably never been there either.  I'll bet you a fiver.  Well, if you'd made that wager with your columnist you'd now be five pounds lighter; although I haven't been to Liswerry I have heard of Pillgwenlly (it was the subject of a column three years ago) and I have passed through St Julians division.  Running north-east along the Caerleon Road from the end of the Newport Bridge over the Usk, St Julians is centred on junction 25 of the congested M4 motorway; the name commemorates St Julius of Caerleon, a local Christian who was martyred during the reign of the Roman emperor Diocletian.  In modern times the major local controversy was the construction of a new primary school on a former landfill site next to the Usk containing hazardous materials.  The major demographic feature of the division is a large student population.  Gun crime doesn't appear to be a major local concern, with a total of two weapons offences recorded in the division so far this year; on the other hand, gun-crime statistics are sometimes misleading.  Ask any politician and they'll tell you it's true.

Ed Townsend had been possibly the most important Lib Dem campaigner in Newport: he fought Newport East in every Westminster and Senedd election from 2003 to 2011, his best result coming in the 2010 Westminster poll when he had 32% of the vote, although he was actually closer to Labour in the 2007 Senedd election.  In the 2011 Senedd poll Townsend fell to 19% and third place as the Coalition in London burst the Lib Dem bubble; a year later eight of the party's nine city councillors went straight outta Newport, with Townsend as the last man standing.  In what had previously been a Lib Dem ward safe as, er, houses, the Labour slate in St Julians surged from third place to beat the Lib Dems 45-42, with Townsend saving his own seat by a single vote over the third Labour candidate.  To add insult to injury, one of the two victorious Labour candidates was Rhys Hutchings, variously also known as Rhys, Dwain Xain Zedong, P Xain and Zardoz of the hiphop group Goldie Lookin Chain - probably best known for the No 3 hit "Guns Don't Kill People, Rappers Do" and with a back catalogue which is far too filthy to enumerate before the 9 o'clock watershed.

There will still be a Townsend on the ballot paper as the Lib Dems attempt to keep their toehold on Newport council - Ed's widow Carmel Townsend, herself a former councillor for the ward from 2008 to 2012.  Labour have made the slightly more conventional choice (compared to Hutchings) of Phil Hourahine, a governor at St Julians primary school. Also on the ballot paper (perhaps "standing" isn't the best choice of phrase given the rest of this sentence) are Carol Bader for the Conservatives, Andrew Byers for UKIP, Plaid Cymru's Chris Priest and Mirka Virtanen of the Green Party.
