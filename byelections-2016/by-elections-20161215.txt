"All the right votes, but not necessarily in the right order"

Before we start this week, you may note that this column has had a name change.  Although the denizens of Dave Leip's US Election Atlas forum, where this column took its first faltering steps over five years ago, still refer to these scribblings as the "Holy Word", in the whole of that time it has had no official name other than "By-election previews".  It was clearly time for a rebrand, and I am indebted to Robert Waller, the veteran psephologist and co-author of the Almanac of British Politics, for inspiring the alternative title "Andrew's Previews".  If you've been led here under false pretences expecting to see Yehudi Menuhin, then, sorry, but hopefully this write-up of the seven local by-elections taking place on 15th December 2016 will form some sort of acceptable substitute.  I'll go get my baton - it's in Devon...

<h2>BOVEY<br/>
CHUDLEIGH</h2>

Teignbridge council, Devon; caused respectively by the deaths of Conservative councillors Anna Klinkenberg and Patricia Johnson-King.  Klinkenberg was first elected for Bovey ward in a by-election in November 1996; she was chairman of the council in 2007 and a founder member of a local home care company.  Johnson-King had lived in Chudleigh for close to 50 years but was in her first term on Teignbridge council, having been elected in 2015 after nearly six years on the town council.

Three of this week's seven polls are in the West Country, so it seems wise to start there.  Two of them are in adjoining wards on the eastern slopes of Dartmoor.  Bovey Tracey, the centre of Bovey ward, is the quintessential Dartmoor market town whose road signs - which bear the slogan "Gateway to the Moor" betray its importance as a tourist centre off the A38 Exeter-Plymouth road.  The Bovey name comes from the river here, while the Tracey refers to the Norman de Tracy family who, despite one of their members being involved in the notorious Becket murder of 1170, turned Bovey into a successful market town.  The town also came to notice during the English Civil War, with a victory at Bovey Heath for Cromwell in January 1646 preceded by an evening in which Cromwell caught a number of Royalist officers off-guard playing cards in a local pub.  Bovey's traditional industries were pottery and opencast clay mining, while some employment is now provided by the Dartmoor National Park Authority, which is located here.  While the town itself and its satellite village of Heathfield lie outside the park boundary much of the nothern part of the ward, including the small parish of Lustleigh, is within the NPA's remit.

The National Park boundaries also take in part of Hennock parish, which is within the Chudleigh ward.  Chudleigh itself functions as a commuter town, bypassed by the A38 and close to the A380 Exeter-Newton Abbot road; the importance of its bypass to the local road network is demonstrated by the fact that before the bypass was built, the road closures for the Chudleigh carnival each summer could lead to 25-mile tailbacks.  Although the Chudley Cannons have been playing Quidditch in the village since 1753 (according to JK Rowling, and I'm not going to contradict that), there is no word on how the team was affected by a major fire in 1807 which essentially destroyed Chudleigh, leaving only the church and seven houses standing.

Both these wards have unchanged boundaries since at least 1979; however, Teignbridge's next boundary review is in progress at the moment, and the Local Government Boundary Commission's draft proposals cut both Bovey and Chudleigh wards down to size.  Hennock village is to move out of Chudleigh ward into Teign Valley ward, with Lustleigh parish transferred from Bovey to a new ward called Tedburn and Moretonhampstead.  Consultation on those recommendations closed at the end of October and the LGBCE's final plan is due out in the new year for implementation at the 2019 election.

Since the creation of Teignbridge council in 1973 Bovey ward's politics had been dominated by long-serving councillor Fernley Holmes, who was elected here as a Labour candidate in 1973, lost her seat in 1976, got it back as an independent candidate in 1979 and finally retired in 2013; her final two re-elections were with the Conservative nomination.  (I must apologise to Holmes for describing her as a man in the 24th October 2013 edition of this column.)  Bovey ward's other two seats have been generally Conservative although the ward did elect an Alliance councillor in 1983 and a Lib Dem in 1995, and the Lib Dem slate polled the most votes in the 2007 election but won only one of the three seats.  Since 2011 Bovey ward has returned a full slate of Conservative councillors, one of whom also sits on Devon county council for the local county division; in 2015 the ward gave 37% to the Tory slate against 24% for the Lib Dems, 16% for the Green Party and 13% for Labour.  In a multi-member first-past-the-post election candidates with exotic names or near the end of the alphabet can often underperform, and the Lib Dem slate in 2015 demonstrated this with Phil Page (yes, really) and Paul van Goor den Oosterlingh trailing a long way behind lead candidate Sally Morgan.

Chudleigh council has traditionally returned independent candidates to Teignbridge council, with the first party candidate to break that pattern being Labour in their zenith year of 1995; the Labour seat was lost back to the independents in a November 1996 by-election.  It took until 2003 for party candidates to get in on the act with the election of a Lib Dem to one of the two seats in 2003; the Tories gained the Lib Dem seat in 2007 and the remaining independent seat in the 2015 election to hold both seats in the ward for the first time.  As in Bovey, the Tories also hold the local county council division; also as in Bovey, there was a rather fragmented vote here in 2015 with 33% for the Tory slate, 25% for outgoing independent councillor Richard Keeling and 15% each for Labour and the Greens.

With this sort of rural area selecting a good candidate is crucial.  The Bovey Tories are hoping that Martyn "Taff" Evans will defend this by-election for them; he is a former Bovey town councillor and also seeking to return to the town council in a simultaneous by-election.  The Lib Dems' Sally Morgan is seeking to return to Teignbridge council after five years away; she sat for this ward from 2007 but lost her seat in 2011.  Labour have selected Christopher Robillard, a town councillor who stood here in 2011.  There is no Green Party candidate this time, so the ballot paper is completed by independent candidates Eoghan Kelly (a Bovey town councillor) and Charlie West (who was the Lib Dem candidate here in the 2013 by-election) and UKIP's Anne Bracher.

In Chudleigh the defending Tory candidate is Chris Webb, a town councillor and former police officer.  Richard Keeling, independent councillor for the ward from 2011 to 2015, is seeking to return to the council and this time has the Lib Dem nomination.  Labour have reselected their regular candidate Janette Parker; with no Green candidate this time the ballot paper is completed by UKIP's Steven Harvey.
