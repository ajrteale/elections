"All the right votes, but not necessarily in the right order"

Before we start this week, you may note that this column has had a name change.  Although the denizens of Dave Leip's US Election Atlas forum, where this column took its first faltering steps over five years ago, still refer to these scribblings as the "Holy Word", in the whole of that time it has had no official name other than "By-election previews".  It was clearly time for a rebrand, and I am indebted to Robert Waller, the veteran psephologist and co-author of the Almanac of British Politics, for inspiring the alternative title "Andrew's Previews".  If you've been led here under false pretences expecting to see Yehudi Menuhin, then, sorry, but hopefully this write-up of the seven local by-elections taking place on 15th December 2016 will form some sort of acceptable substitute.  I'll go get my baton - it's in Devon...

<h2>BOVEY<br/>
CHUDLEIGH</h2>

Teignbridge council, Devon; caused respectively by the deaths of Conservative councillors Anna Klinkenberg and Patricia Johnson-King.  Klinkenberg was first elected for Bovey ward in a by-election in November 1996; she was chairman of the council in 2007 and a founder member of a local home care company.  Johnson-King had lived in Chudleigh for close to 50 years but was in her first term on Teignbridge council, having been elected in 2015 after nearly six years on the town council.

Three of this week's seven polls are in the West Country, so it seems wise to start there.  Two of them are in adjoining wards on the eastern slopes of Dartmoor.  Bovey Tracey, the centre of Bovey ward, is the quintessential Dartmoor market town whose road signs - which bear the slogan "Gateway to the Moor" betray its importance as a tourist centre off the A38 Exeter-Plymouth road.  The Bovey name comes from the river here, while the Tracey refers to the Norman de Tracy family who, despite one of their members being involved in the notorious Becket murder of 1170, turned Bovey into a successful market town.  The town also came to notice during the English Civil War, with a victory at Bovey Heath for Cromwell in January 1646 preceded by an evening in which Cromwell caught a number of Royalist officers off-guard playing cards in a local pub.  Bovey's traditional industries were pottery and opencast clay mining, while some employment is now provided by the Dartmoor National Park Authority, which is located here.  While the town itself and its satellite village of Heathfield lie outside the park boundary much of the nothern part of the ward, including the small parish of Lustleigh, is within the NPA's remit.

The National Park boundaries also take in part of Hennock parish, which is within the Chudleigh ward.  In contrast to Bovey, which has a large retired population, Chudleigh functions as a commuter town for Exeter, bypassed by the A38 and close to the A380 Exeter-Newton Abbot road; the importance of its bypass to the local road network is demonstrated by the fact that before the bypass was built, the road closures for the Chudleigh carnival each summer could lead to 25-mile tailbacks.  Although the Chudley Cannons have been playing Quidditch in the village since 1753 (according to JK Rowling, and I'm not going to contradict that), there is no word on how the team was affected by a major fire in 1807 which essentially destroyed Chudleigh, leaving only the church and seven houses standing.

Both these wards have unchanged boundaries since at least 1979; however, Teignbridge's next boundary review is in progress at the moment, and the Local Government Boundary Commission's draft proposals cut both Bovey and Chudleigh wards down to size.  Hennock village is to move out of Chudleigh ward into Teign Valley ward, with Lustleigh parish transferred from Bovey to a new ward called Tedburn and Moretonhampstead.  Consultation on those recommendations closed at the end of October and the LGBCE's final plan is due out in the new year for implementation at the 2019 election.

Since the creation of Teignbridge council in 1973 Bovey ward's politics had been dominated by long-serving councillor Fernley Holmes, who was elected here as a Labour candidate in 1973, lost her seat in 1976, got it back as an independent candidate in 1979 and finally retired in 2013; her final two re-elections were with the Conservative nomination.  (I must apologise to Holmes for describing her as a man in the 24th October 2013 edition of this column.)  Bovey ward's other two seats have been generally Conservative although the ward did elect an Alliance councillor in 1983 and a Lib Dem in 1995, and the Lib Dem slate polled the most votes in the 2007 election but won only one of the three seats.  Since 2011 Bovey ward has returned a full slate of Conservative councillors, one of whom also sits on Devon county council for the local county division; in 2015 the ward gave 37% to the Tory slate against 24% for the Lib Dems, 16% for the Green Party and 13% for Labour.  In a multi-member first-past-the-post election candidates with surnames which are exotic or near the end of the alphabet can often underperform, and the Lib Dem slate in 2015 demonstrated this with Phil Page (yes, really) and Paul van Goor den Oosterlingh trailing a long way behind lead candidate Sally Morgan.

Chudleigh council has traditionally returned independent candidates to Teignbridge council, with the first party candidate to break that pattern being Labour in their zenith year of 1995; the Labour seat was lost back to the independents in a November 1996 by-election.  It took until 2003 for party candidates to get in on the act with the election of a Lib Dem to one of the two seats in 2003; the Tories gained the Lib Dem seat in 2007 and the remaining independent seat in the 2015 election to hold both seats in the ward for the first time.  As in Bovey, the Tories also hold the local county council division; also as in Bovey, there was a rather fragmented vote here in 2015 with 33% for the Tory slate, 25% for outgoing independent councillor Richard Keeling and 15% each for Labour and the Greens.

With this sort of rural area selecting a good candidate is crucial.  The Bovey Tories are hoping that Martyn "Taff" Evans will defend this by-election for them; he is a former Bovey town councillor and also seeking to return to the town council in a simultaneous by-election.  The Lib Dems' Sally Morgan is seeking to return to Teignbridge council after five years away; she sat for this ward from 2007 but lost her seat in 2011, and also represented the town on Devon county council until 2009.  Labour have selected Christopher Robillard, a town councillor who stood here in 2011.  There is no Green Party candidate this time, so the ballot paper is completed by independent candidates Eoghan Kelly (a Bovey town councillor) and Charlie West (who was the Lib Dem candidate here in the 2013 by-election) and UKIP's Anne Bracher.

In Chudleigh the defending Tory candidate is Chris Webb, a town councillor and former police officer.  Richard Keeling, independent councillor for the ward from 2011 to 2015, is seeking to return to the council and this time has the Lib Dem nomination.  Labour have reselected their regular candidate Janette Parker; with no Green candidate this time the ballot paper is completed by UKIP's Steven Harvey.

<h2>BLACKDOWN</h2>
Taunton Deane council, Somerset; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Charlotte Edwards who had served since 2015.  She had found it difficult to balance work and family commitments with her role as a councillor.

Staying in the West Country, we move over the border into Somerset.  Somerset has two wards with the name Blackdown; this is the Taunton Deane one, a ward of tiny villages to the south of the M5 motorway covering the parishes of Churchstanton, Otterford and Pitminster.  The ward has a relatively old age profile, being in the top 40 in England and Wales for people in the 45-64 age bracket (37% of the population).

On its present boundaries Blackdown ward was created in 1987 and has safely returned Conservatives at every opportunity: in 2015 the Tories had 53% to 21% for the Lib Dems and 15% for an independent candidate.  On the other hand, no councillor for this ward has sought re-election since 1995 which suggests that there is some instability under the surface.  Looking up to county level reinforces that impression as the Lib Dems narrowly hold the local county seat (Blackdown and Neroche).

So this by-election - which may the last to this ward in its present form, as Taunton Deane council is in merger talks with the tiny West Somerset district - might be more interesting than previous district elections would suggest.  There aren't many by-election candidates with an IMDB profile, but one of them is the defending Tory candidate Giuseppe Fraschini, an actor and voiceover artist who was born in Switzerland but has lived in the UK since infancy.  The Lib Dems have selected their local county councillor Ross Henley, a former leader of Taunton Deane council who is seeking a quick return to the district council after losing his seat in Wellington East ward last year by just four votes.  Completing the ballot paper is independent candidate Carl Benneyworth, a farmer and the only candidate to give an address within the ward (in Churchinford).

<h2>MORETON HALL</h2>
St Edmundsbury council, Suffolk; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Terry Buckle.  He had served since 2003.

For our East Anglian by-election this week we have come to the city of Bury St Edmunds.  Moreton Hall itself is an 18th-century country house designed by Robert Adam which now functions as a preparatory school.  The ward named after Moreton Hall is a post-war housing development which is responsible for much of Bury's population growth over the last twenty years and is still growing; the ward is cut off from the city by the A14 and connected to the outside world by junction 44 of that road.  This is essentially a middle-class commuter area with high employment - the ward is only just outside the top 100 in England and Wales for full-time employment.

Moreton Hall ward was created in 2003 taking three-quarters of the electorate of the former Eastgate ward, which had become grossly oversized because of all the new development.  The old Eastgate ward had split its two seats between Labour and the Tories in 1999; at the first election to Moreton Hall ward the Tories beat Labour 58-42 in votes, but Labour had been guaranteed a seat because the Tories didn't have a full slate.  The Labour councillor, Trevor Beckwith, then turned independent and topped the poll in the 2007 and 2011 elections, but lost his seat to the Conservatives in 2015 after twenty years' service; shares of the vote were 44% for the Conservatives - who were guaranteed a seat due to insufficient opposition candidates - to 34% for Beckwith and 23% for Labour.  Beckwith still holds the local county council seat (Eastgate and Moreton Hall), having gained it from the Conservatives in 2009.

Defending for the Tories is Sue Bill.  Trevor Beckwith is back as an independent candidate, seeking to make a quick return to the borough council.  The Labour candidate is Alex Griffin, and the ballot paper is completed by UKIP's Julian Flood and the Lib Dems' Chris Lale.
