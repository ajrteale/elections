There are eight by-elections on 24th November 2016.  Nine were scheduled, but a by-election to St Edmundsbury council in Suffolk has returned a Conservative unopposed.  Here are the other eight:

<h2>WARSOP CARRS</h2>

Mansfield council, Nottinghamshire; caused by the death of Labour councillor Peter Crawford at the age of 71.  He was first elected in 2007 for the former Birklands ward and transferred to this ward following boundary changes in 2011.

For the week's Midlands by-election we are in the Nottinghamshire coalfield.  Warsop Carrs is the north-western of the four wards covering the parish of Warsop, an old mining area on the A60 Mansfield-Worksop road: Carrs ward includes the western part of Market Warsop and the villages of Church Warsop and Warsop Vale.  Warsop Vale was the location of a major colliery, Warsop Main; although the church in Church Warsop is Norman, the village is of very recent vintage, having been built in the 1930s by the Staveley Coal and Iron Company as accommodation for colliery workers.  The coalmining legacy has left a very white British population with low qualification levels and high rates of long-term sickness.  Unemployment rates are not particularly high, although this may partly be due to the largest local employer being the notorious Sports Direct warehouse in Shirebrook, just over the Derbyshire boundary, it's no surprise to find that the ward's economic profile is determinedly working-class.

Warsop is the part of Mansfield least affected by the district's takeover by the pro-mayoral slate Mansfield Independent Forum; before 2011 the area was part of Meden ward which had a full slate of Labour councillors, and Warsop Carrs ward has followed suit since its creation.  In the 2015 election Labour beat the Forum 73-27 in a straight fight.

Defending for Labour is Andrew Burgin.  The Mansfield Independent Forum have not nominated a candidate this time, but there is an independent candidate on the ballot paper, Debra Barlow who received a double lung transplant last year and now campaigns for organ donation.  Also standing are Raymond Forster for UKIP and Daniel Redfern for the Conservatives.

<h2>VALLEY</h2>

Tandridge council, Surrey; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Jill Caudle, who is moving away from the area to be closer to her family.  She had served since 2000.

Tandridge council has had a rash of by-elections recently - this is the third poll since July.  The Valley referred to here is Caterham Valley, a dry valley in the North Downs.  Caterham boomed in Victorian times as a result of the railway arriving in 1859; the present Valley ward runs from the railway station northwards along the valley to the Croydon Road Roundabout, at which the A22 Caterham Bypass ends.  The ward has a commuter demographic with high full-time employment levels.

Despite this, Valley ward is far from being a lock for the Conservatives.  The ward's boundaries are unchanged since 1976, so we can trace its election results over an unusually long time.  During the Thatcher years Valley was a close Tory versus Labour battle, but Labour only won it twice, in 1984 (by one vote) and 1988 - both years when there was no Alliance candidate.  The collapse of the Tory vote during the latter Major years turned the ward into a Labour-inclined three-way marginal, the Lib Dems' Jill Caudle finally breaking through in 2000 when both seats were up.  Caudle quickly developed a personal vote which led to some yo-yoing in the ward's election results through the Noughties.  The remaining Labour councillor was re-elected in 2004 but after that their vote in the ward collapsed and it was a very easy Tory gain in 2008.  The Tories, however, lost their seat in May to the Lib Dems who now held both seats in the ward for the first time: shares of the vote were 39% for the Lib Dems, 24% for the Conservatives, 15% for UKIP and 13% for Labour.  The Tories are in better shape at county level, in which this ward is part of the safe Conservative Caterham Valley division.

Defending for the Lib Dems is Dorinda Cooper, described as a young and energetic community campaigner.  The Conservatives have selected Paul Shipway.  Regular UKIP candidate Jeffrey Bolter returns to the fray: a former Metropolitan Police officer and Police Federation rep, he fought Wells in the 2015 general election and Croydon South in 2010.  Completing the ballot paper is Labour's Mark Wood.

<h2>TADLEY SOUTH</h2>

Basingstoke and Deane council, Hampshire; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Rob Musson at the age of 63.  A successful businessman and well-respected community figure, he had served since 2007.

Located just south of the Hampshire/Berkshire boundary, Tadley is one of those villages that has grown into the size of a town without anybody particularly noticing.  The spur for this was the development after the Second World War of the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment at Aldermaston, just over the county boundary in Berkshire, and Tadley boomed in the 1950s and 1960s to provide accomodation for the AWRE's workers and their families.  Facilities have been slower to arrive and transport links to the nearest large towns - Basingstoke, Reading and Newbury - are relatively poor.  

Tadley South is a safe Conservative ward with few points of interest - in May the Tories beat the Lib Dems here 63-21.  However, the Tories did lose the local county council seat (Tadley and Baughurst) to the Lib Dems in the 2013 and will be looking for a good performance here to set down a marker ahead of next May's county council elections.

Defending for the Conservatives is Kerri Carruthers.  The Lib Dem candidate is Jo Slimin; she is a former Basingstoke and Deane councillor (Tadley North ward, 2002-3) and has served on Tadley town council since 1983.  Completing the ballot paper are Claire Ballard for Labour and Phil Heath for UKIP.

<h2>SOVEREIGN</h2>

Eastbourne council, East Sussex; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Ray Blakebrough due to work commitments.  He had served since 2015.

Having started in Carlisle and gradually worked our way south, we have finally reached the south coast.  Sovereign is Eastbourne's easternmost ward but is probably not what you expected Eastbourne to be.  The ward is based on a very new and very large marina development around Sovereign Harbour, which claims to be the largest composite marina complex in northern Europe; much of the ward's housing has been built since 2000 and its population is still growing strongly.  Despite this, Sovereign ward does share some of the typical economic indicators of Eastbourne including a relatively old age profile and high levels of private renting.

While at local level Eastbourne is a Tory versus Lib Dem battle Sovereign is one of the Tory-inclined wards (the Lib Dems have won it only once, in 2007) and its growing population is trending it more towards the Conservatives over time.  In 2015 the Tory slate here won with 41% to 25% for the Lib Dems and 21% for UKIP.  The ward has the same boundaries as the Sovereign division of East Sussex county council, which in 2013 the Tories narrowly held with 39%, to 34% for UKIP and 19% for the Lib Dems.  There are no implications for control of the borough council, which despite the loss of the parliamentary seat in 2015 has a large Lib Dem majority.

Defending for the Tories in this maritime-inclined ward is Paul Metcalfe, who has recently retired as manager of the Eastbourne lifeboat station which is in this ward.  The Lib Dem candidate is Roger Metcalfe, who works for Age Concern and is treasurer of Eastbourne Lib Dems.  Surprisingly there is no UKIP candidate, so the ballot paper is completed by Labour's Louis Thorburn.

<h2>TURN HILL</h2>

South Somerset council; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Shane Pledger.  A builder and stonemason, he had served since 2011.

Saving the best till last, we are in Somerset for the most crucial by-election of the week.  The Turn Hill ward is a rural area covering four-and-a-half parishes to the west of Somerton, none of which are called Turn Hill.  The largest parish within the ward is High Ham, known as the location of England's only remaining thatched windmill (Stembridge Tower Mill) and as the birthplace of the broadcaster and former Counterpoint host Ned Sherrin; however, the ward's largest village is Long Sutton which has given the world Huntley and Palmer biscuits (George Palmer was from Long Sutton) and in latter years was the home of one of the victims of the Great Celebrity Purge of 2016, Yes Minister co-writer Sir Antony Jay.

Turn Hill was a fight between independent candidates in the 2000s, but party politics broke out in the 2011 election upon the retirement of independent councillor Rupert Cox: Pledger won 59-41 in a straight fight with the Lib Dems and increased his majority to 58-34 in the 2015 election.  The ward is split between two county council divisions (Curry Rivel and Langport, and Somerton) both of which were safely Conservative in the 2013 county elections.  This might suggest that the Conservatives are favoured to hold this seat, but the Lib Dems will definitely have their eye on it: they held the local parliamentary seat until 2015 and are still the largest party on South Somerset council with 30 out of 60 seats.  As can be seen, a Lib Dem gain in this by-election will give the party an overall majority on the council.

As John Humphreys says on Mastermind, there's everything to play for so let's get on with it.  Defending for the Conservatives is Gerard Tucker, president of the Langport and Somerton Rotary club and the only candidate to give an address within the ward (in Aller).  The Lib Dem candidate is Julia Gadd, a Langport town councillor who stood here in 2011.  Completing the ballot paper is Sean Dromgoole for Labour.
