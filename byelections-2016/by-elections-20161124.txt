<h2>TURN HILL</h2>

South Somerset council; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Shane Pledger.  A builder and stonemason, he had served since 2011.

Saving the best till last, we are in Somerset for the most crucial by-election of the week.  The Turn Hill ward is a rural area covering four-and-a-half parishes to the west of Somerton, none of which are called Turn Hill.  The largest parish within the ward is High Ham, known as the location of England's only remaining thatched windmill (Stembridge Tower Mill) and as the birthplace of the broadcaster and former Counterpoint host Ned Sherrin; however, the ward's largest village is Long Sutton which has given the world Huntley and Palmer biscuits (George Palmer was from Long Sutton) and in latter years was the home of one of the victims of the Great Celebrity Purge of 2016, Yes Minister co-writer Sir Antony Jay.

Turn Hill was a fight between independent candidates in the 2000s, but party politics broke out in the 2011 election upon the retirement of independent councillor Rupert Cox: Pledger won 59-41 in a straight fight with the Lib Dems and increased his majority to 58-34 in the 2015 election.  The ward is split between two county council divisions (Curry Rivel and Langport, and Somerton) both of which were safely Conservative in the 2013 county elections.  This might suggest that the Conservatives are favoured to hold this seat, but the Lib Dems will definitely have their eye on it: they held the local parliamentary seat until 2015 and are still the largest party on South Somerset council with 30 out of 60 seats.  As can be seen, a Lib Dem gain in this by-election will give the party an overall majority on the council.

As John Humphreys says on Mastermind, there's everything to play for so let's get on with it.  Defending for the Conservatives is Gerard Tucker, president of the Langport and Somerton Rotary club and the only candidate to give an address within the ward (in Aller).  The Lib Dem candidate is Julia Gadd, a Langport town councillor who stood here in 2011.  Completing the ballot paper is Sean Dromgoole for Labour.
