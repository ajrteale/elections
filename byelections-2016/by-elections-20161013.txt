LIMPSFIELD, Tandridge council, Surrey; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor John Pannett.  He had served since 2010.

After four by-elections in Kent past and present, we hop just over the county boundary into Surrey.  The village of Limpsfield, located on the slopes of the North Downs just north-east of Oxted and essentially an extension of it, is an old village notable for two mediaeval buildings: the twelfth-century timber-framed Old Court Cottage, once the home of Battle Abbey's manorial court; and St Peter's church which dates from the same era.  Buried in St Peter's churchyard are two of the towering figures in English classical music, the composer Frederick Delius and the conductor Sir Thomas Beecham; while more recent famous figures associated with the village include the England cricket captain Lord Cowdrey of Tonbridge and the TV host Davina McCall.  The census betrays that this is a middle-class commuter ward, with 53% of the workforce in management-level positions and 47% holding degree-level qualifications.

This is a true-blue area.  Limpsfield ward's boundaries are unchanged since the founding electoral arrangements for Tandridge district in 1973, and in all the years since then it has only twice failed to return a Conservative: in 1973 when the ward's two seats split between the Tories and Liberals, and in 1991 when the Tories stood down in favour of an independent candidate (who was later re-elected several times as a Conservative).  At the most recent poll in 2015 the Tories beat the Lib Dems here 70-12, and the local county council seat (Oxted) is also safely Conservative.  However, the previous results list doesn't take account of a new kid on the block, the localist Oxted and Limpsfield Residents Group; Limpsfield ward wasn't up in May, but the Residents contested and won the neighbouring ward of Oxted North and Tandridge.

Establishment candidates don't get much more establishment than the Tories' Neil O'Brien OBE; one of the few council by-election candidates to merit his own Wikipedia page, O'Brien was a former director of Policy Exchange, a centre-right think tank, before joining the Government as a special advisor to George Osborne; he has been kept on as a SPAD by the May administration.  His opponents are Sheelagh Crampton of the Lib Dems, who fought the ward in 2014 and 2015; Simon Charles of Labour; and Phil Davies of the Residents Group.

BROADSTONE, Poole council, Dorset; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Joanne Tomlin on health grounds.  She had served since 2015.

We finish the week in Broadstone, a northern suburb of Poole which is still sufficiently semi-detached to be recognised as a separate town by the Post Office.  Broadstone's census statistics reveal a rather old, middle-class demographic: it is in the top 50 wards in England and Wales for owner-occupation (93% of households) and 21% of the workforce are retired.  Broadstone's traditional industry was lavender oil, but it's now an integral part of the Bournemouth-Poole conurbation and generally residential.  The town's most notable resident was the evolutionary naturalist Alfred Russell Wallace, whose tomb in Broadstone cemetery is topped not by a traditional headstone but by a 7-foot-high fossilised treetrunk.

Broadstone's local elections are most certainly not fossilised, being closely fought between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats.  On its present boundaries the ward only dates from 2015 but is little changed from the 2003-15 Broadstone ward, which returned two Lib Dem councillors and one Conservative in 2003 but had a full Lib Dem slate in the 2007 and 2011 elections.  The Conservatives did well across Poole in the 2015 election and gained two seats in this ward, but couldn't knock out popular Lib Dem councillor Mike Brooke who topped the poll a long way ahead of his running-mates; Brooke's personal vote meant that the Lib Dems carried the ward 45-36.

So, an interesting contest is in prospect.  Defending for the Tories is Marc Ujvari, the losing Conservative candidate in 2015; he works in finance for Barclays.  The Lib Dems have selected Vikki Slade, who failed to hold the local parliamentary seat (Mid Dorset and North Poole) in the 2015 general election; she was a Poole councillor for this ward from 2011 to 2015 and is hoping to return to the council.  Also standing are Alan Gerring for UKIP, Mark Chivers for the Green Party and Jason Sanderson for Labour.
