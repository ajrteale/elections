BROADSTONE, Poole council, Dorset; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Joanne Tomlin on health grounds.  She had served since 2015.

We finish the week in Broadstone, a northern suburb of Poole which is still sufficiently semi-detached to be recognised as a separate town by the Post Office.  Broadstone's census statistics reveal a rather old, middle-class demographic: it is in the top 50 wards in England and Wales for owner-occupation (93% of households) and 21% of the workforce are retired.  Broadstone's traditional industry was lavender oil, but it's now an integral part of the Bournemouth-Poole conurbation and generally residential.  The town's most notable resident was the evolutionary naturalist Alfred Russell Wallace, whose tomb in Broadstone cemetery is topped not by a traditional headstone but by a 7-foot-high fossilised treetrunk.

Broadstone's local elections are most certainly not fossilised, being closely fought between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats.  On its present boundaries the ward only dates from 2015 but is little changed from the 2003-15 Broadstone ward, which returned two Lib Dem councillors and one Conservative in 2003 but had a full Lib Dem slate in the 2007 and 2011 elections.  The Conservatives did well across Poole in the 2015 election and gained two seats in this ward, but couldn't knock out popular Lib Dem councillor Mike Brooke who topped the poll a long way ahead of his running-mates; Brooke's personal vote meant that the Lib Dems carried the ward 45-36.

So, an interesting contest is in prospect.  Defending for the Tories is Marc Ujvari, the losing Conservative candidate in 2015; he works in finance for Barclays.  The Lib Dems have selected Vikki Slade, who failed to hold the local parliamentary seat (Mid Dorset and North Poole) in the 2015 general election; she was a Poole councillor for this ward from 2011 to 2015 and is hoping to return to the council.  Also standing are Alan Gerring for UKIP, Mark Chivers for the Green Party and Jason Sanderson for Labour.
