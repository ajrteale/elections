WESTGATE, Lancaster council; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor David Smith.  He had served since 2011.

Moving into Lancashire and we're in the town of Morecambe.  Westgate is Morecambe's inland ward, an area of low-lying housing on the far side of the old Green Ayre and Heysham railway lines almost all of which has gone up since the Second World War.  Included within the ward is the large White Lund industrial estate straddling the link road to Heysham; not shown on the map is the new Lancaster Northern Bypass, scheduled to open later this month to provide Wesgate ward with a fast link to the M6 motorway without having to negotiate the notorious traffic bottleneck which is Lancaster city centre.  The ward is only just outside the top 100 in England and Wales for jobs classified by the census as "semi-routine"; reflecting this, qualification rates are low and part-time working is high.

Morecambe's local elections were dominated for most of the last two decades by a localist slate called the Morecambe Bay Independents, who were briefly powerful enough to be the largest party on Lancaster city council (which covers Morecambe and a large rural hinterland, so it's perenially hung).  The MBI had a lock on Wesgate ward's elections before 2010, but Labour gained two seats in 2011 and got a full slate in the 2015 election (the first one on the current ward boundaries); despite this, the election was rather fragmented with 33% for the Labour slate, 25% each for the Tories and UKIP and 18% for the MBI.  Most of the ward is within the Morecambe South county division which Labour gained from the Tories in 2013 in a three-way marginal result (UKIP being the third party).

Defending for Labour is Ian Clift, a Morecambe town councillor seeking to make a comeback on the city council - he was a city councillor for Torrisholme ward from 2003 to 2007, then representing the Liberal Democrats.  The Tory candidate is Daniel Gibbins, who fought Halton-with-Aughton ward in 2015.  UKIP have reselected their 2015 candidate for the ward Michelle Ogden, a Morecambe town councillor.  A third Morecambe town councillor on the ballot is Roger Dennison, former leader of the Morecambe Bay Independents.  Completing the ballot paper are Richard Moriarty for the Green Party and Louise Stansfield for the Lib Dems.

CLIFF VILLAGES, North Kesteven council, Lincolnshire; caused by the resignation of councillor Laura Conway, who represented the Lincolnshire Independents, due to work commitments.  She had served since 2011.

For this week's only rural by-election we are in a Lincolnshire ward covering a series of villages atop the Lincoln Cliff, a 50-mile-long limestone escarpment which runs in an almost straight line from Grantham to the Humber, breached only by two rivers at Lincoln and Ancaster.  The top of the Cliff has been an important transport artery since prehistoric times, with the ancient track now called the Jurassic Way superseded by the Roman Ermine Street and the modern A607 Lincoln-Grantham road.  The Cliff Villages in this ward are seven parishes running from Harmston in the north to Leadenham in the south; all of these parishes have long, thin shapes running from the plateau in the east to the River Brent in the west, betraying that these are spring-line villages.  The largest centre of population is Navenby, a former market town which is now a fast-growing Lincoln dormitory village; the smallest parish within the ward is Boothby Graffoe, which formerly gave its name to an ancient wapentake of Lincolnshire and is now the stage name for a stand-up comedian.

Cliff Villages ward was formed in 1999 by merging the former Navenby and Wellingore wards, and at district council level is the personal fiefdom of long-serving independent councillor Marianne Overton who since 2011 has run under the Lincolnshire Independents label.  Conway was elected in 2011 on Overton's coat-tails, gaining her seat from the Conservatives, and in 2015 the Lincolnshire Independent slate was opposed only by a single Conservative candidate, who lost 64-36.  Overton is also the county councillor for Branston and Navenby division, although part of the ward is within the Conservative county division of Bassingham Rural.

Defending for the Lincolnshire Independents is Cat Mills, a parish councillor in Wellingore and the only candidate to live within the ward.  The Conservative candidate is Daniel Gray, from Cranwell, and the ballot paper is completed by the ward's first Liberal Democrat candidate, Aarron Smith.

BROCKLEY and EVELYN, Lewisham council, South London; caused respectively by the resignation of Baroness Kennedy of Cradley and the death of Crada Onuegbu.  Onuegbu had served since 1998 and had served on the Lewisham cabinet; Kennedy had served since 2014 after many years in the central organisation of the Labour party, including as deputy general secretary and special advisor to Ed Miliband.  Both were Labour councillors.

"Was the first Anniversary our Society for the Choice of new Officers, according to the Tenor of our Patent, & Institution; it being St. Andrews day, who was our Patron, each fellow wearing a St. Andrews Crosse of ribbon on the crowne of his hatt, after the Election was over, we all dined together, his Majestie sending us Venison:"
-John Evelyn, Diary, 30 November 1663

The old Metropolitan Borough of Deptford had a practice of naming its wards not after geography but after famous historical people associated with the borough.  Before 2002 Lewisham had five such wards covering the old Deptford borough: Drake, Evelyn, Grinling Gibbons, Marlowe and Pepys; however, the last boundary review abolished Grinling Gibbons ward and renamed the other three after geography.  Marlowe ward transformed into New Cross, Pepys was succeeded by Telegraph Hill, and Drake ward's successor is the modern Brockley; leaving as the successor to that policy only Evelyn ward, named after the diarist John Evelyn (1620-1706), one of the founders of the Royal Society.

Evelyn lived in the modern ward named after him at his Sayes Court house, next to a royal dockyard developed by King Henry VIII in the Deptford Strand parish, at the point where the Kent/Surrey boundary met the Thames.  Peter the Great learned how to build ships at Deptford, renting Sayes Court from John Evelyn at the time (and apparently trashing the place).  Much has, of course, changed since Evelyn's day; Sayes Court has long gone; most of its gardens, a Victorian pleasure spot, have disappeared; the industrial units on the old dockyard are now being redeveloped and railways criss-cross the area.  The ward is linked to central London by Deptford railway station, opened in 1836 on the original London and Greenwich railway and said to be the oldest suburban railway station in the world, with six trains per hour to London Bridge and Cannon Street.  Postally the area is almost entirely within the SE8 (Deptford) postal district, with small parts around the fringes in SE14 (New Cross) and SE16 (Rotherhithe).

Away from the riverside lies Brockley ward, served by the Overground stations of Brockley, New Cross and New Cross Gate, with St Johns railway station lying inside the ward and Deptford Bridge DLR station just outside its boundary.  The area took its name from a pub, the Brockley Jack on Brockley Road, which now serves as a theatre as well as a pub.  It is the home of Goldsmith's College, part of the University of London specialising in the arts and social sciences, and this arts focus together with its large Victorian housing has given Brockley a bohemian demographic.  Brockley makes the top 100 wards in England and Wales for black population (24%) and mixed-race population (7.4%) and its demographic is rather more middle-class than Evelyn.

Evelyn ward's social makeup has become even more caught up in London's transformation into a world city; 61% of the population is non-white according to the most recent census.  The ward features in several top 20 England and Wales lists for unusual population features: 18th-highest black population (35.9%), 11th-highest Black African population (22.2%); 8th-highest Buddhist population (3.9%).  The ward's Chinese population is also noticeably high (6.5%), perhaps a side effect of several University of London colleges in the general area; census figures tend to show a strong positive correlation between Chinese and student populations.  There is a large council estate in the ward (the Pepys estate) and more than half of the ward's housing is socially rented, 38% from Lewisham council.

Evelyn ward seems to have a high councillor attrition rate: in the last four years two of its councillors have died and a third resigned to set up an orphanage in his native Togo.  Politically, there's not much to see in Evelyn: it's a very safe Labour ward and the interest for the other parties usually lies in who comes a distant second.  In the 2014 elections, and in the last by-election in March 2013, that second place was filled by a local left-wing slate called Lewisham People Before Profit, who also managed second in Evelyn when they stood a candidate in the Greenwich and Lewisham constituency at the 2012 London Assembly election.  The 2014 borough elections gave Labour 53% to 18% for People Before Profit and 15% for the Green Party, while in May's Assembly elections Sadiq Khan beat Zac Goldsmith 63-15 and Labour led the Tories on the list ballot 60-11.

Bohemian Brockley, on the other hand, is one of London's longest-standing Green hotspots and in the 2014 London borough elections was one of only four wards in the city to return a Green councillor (the others were Highgate ward in Camden, Highbury East ward in Islington and St Leonard's ward in Lambeth).  This is mainly down to Darren Johnson, a long-standing Green activist who was their London mayoral candidate in 2000 and 2004; he was elected to Lewisham council in 2002 and got the entire Green slate elected in 2006, but Labour took two seats back in the 2010 election.  Johnson retired from the council in 2014, but the Green Party held their seat in Brockley with new councillor John Coughlin - the only opposition member of Lewisham council.  The shares at the 2014 borough elections were 38% for Labour, 28% for the Greens and 13% for People Before Profit; the Green performance in May was less impressive with Sadiq Khan beating their candidate Siân Berry 63-14 and Labour carrying the London Members ballot with 51%, to 22% for the Greens and 9% for the Conservatives.  With the Greens generally having a poor record, the omens for them gaining this seat - which would give them group status on Lewisham council - are not promising.

Defending for Labour in Brockley is Sophie McGeevor, a charity communications manager with a PhD in history from Cambridge; she is the vice-chair of the Deptford branch of the Labour party, and according to her Twitter she loves gardening, Björk, and jumpsuits.  The Greens have selected a candidate right from the top of the party: the national party chairman Clare Phipps, who hit the headlines before the last general election for trying to stand for parliament in Basingstoke on a job-share basis - there's no provision for this so her joint nomination was rejected.  People Before Profit are not standing in Brockley, so completing the ballot paper are Andrew Hughes for the Conservatives, Bobby Dean for the Lib Dems, Hugh Waine for UKIP and Rebecca Manson Jones of the Women's Equality Party.

The defending Labour candidate in the Evelyn by-election is Joyce Jacca, a long-standing community worker.  People Before Profit's candidate is Ray Barron-Woolford, whose candidacy in the 2014 borough elections in New Cross ward was profiled by Vice <http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/ray-woolford-election-candidate-ray-woolford>; his Twitter describes himself as an activist, radio commentator and food bank founder.  Standing for the Green Party is Andrea Carey-Fuller, a community care lawyer, and the ballot paper is completed by Lucy Salek for the Lib Dems, independent candidate Scott Barkwith and Conservative James Clark.

SWANLEY, Kent county council; and SWANLEY CHRISTCHURCH AND SWANLEY VILLAGE, Sevenoaks council, Kent; both caused by the death of Conservative councillor Robert Brookbank.  He had served since 2007 on Sevenoaks council and since 2009 on Kent county council.

Moving out of London into Kent proper, but only just outside the Greater London boundary and still within the M25.  Before 1861 Swanley consisted of three houses; then the Chatham and Dover railway came here, building a junction for its Medway and Maidstone routes, and a new settlement (originally "Swanley Junction") grew up around the station.  Horticulture quickly became the town's major industry thanks to the opening of the Swanley horticultural college in 1887 (it has since became part of Wye college near Canterbury), and there are still apple and pear trees in people's gardens left over from the original orchards; while there was also a thriving health sector with three hospitals at which Londoners could convalesce following major surgery, away from the Smoke.  Although these industries are no longer significant to Swanley, it has grown strongly thanks to its good transport links (on the Chatham line, the M25 and the A20) to become a mini-New Town, becoming a parish of its own in 1955.  If you're in London and fancy a trip there after reading this preview, you may be thrilled to know that Swanley station joined the Oyster network this year.

Despite Swanley's strong links with London it was never incorporated into Greater London, leaving it politically rather out on a limb as a working-class part of the safe Conservative district and constituency based on Sevenoaks, some distance to the south.  Swanley St Mary's ward makes the top 100 in England and Wales for population with between 1 and 4 GCSEs or equivalent (19% of the workforce); both Hextable, and Swanley Christchurch and Swanley Village wards have a very high level of occupations classed by the census as "intermediate" (19% of the workforce in both cases); while Swanley St Mary's and Swanley White Oak wards have high levels of social housing.  Those two wards (essentially, Swanley north of the railway line) plus almost all of Hextable ward make up the Swanley division of Kent county council, which voted Labour in 2005 but was gained by the Tories in 2009; Brookbank was re-elected in 2013 with 41% of the vote, to 32% for Labour and 20% for UKIP.  This might look like a winnable marginal for Labour, but a look at last year's district council elections serves to pour cold water on that idea: the Tories won five of the district council seats within the division (to one for Labour and one for an independent).  Runner-up here in the 2009 election with 23% of the vote (falling to fifth and 2.4% in 2013) was Steve Uncles, leader of the south-east branch of the English Democrats, who appeared before Dartford magistrates in 2014 accused of falsifying nomination papers for the 2013 Kent county council elections, but is still awaiting trial having successfully managed to put off his most recent date in court by standing for election as Kent police and crime commissioner.

The excitement in Swanley Christchurch and Swanley Village (essentially, Swanley south of the railway line) is confined to the ballot box; Labour carried the ward in 2003 but the Tories gained in 2007, and the ward now appears safe for the Conservatives after they beat Labour 59-28 in the 2015 district elections.  At county level this ward is part of the safe Conservative Darent Valley division.  Some of the electors in this ward will be thrilled to know that their polling station is a pub (the Lamb in Swanley Village).

In the Sevenoaks district by-election Clare Barnes, a Swanley town councillor, defends for the Conservatives.  Labour have selected Jacqueline Griffiths, a retired nursing lecturer.  Also standing are candidates from two parties contesting the ward for the first time: Medina Hall for UKIP and Krish Shanmuganathan for the Lib Dems.

The Kent county by-election is defended for the Conservatives by Michael Horwood, district councillor for Eynsford ward.  The Labour candidate is Angela George, a former district councillor for Swanley White Oak ward who lost her seat in the 2015 election to Tory candidate James Halford; Halford has since defected to UKIP and is standing in the county by-election under his new colours.  Completing the ballot paper is Lib Dem Robert Woodbridge, who stood in the 2015 district elections as a Green candidate.

LIMPSFIELD, Tandridge council, Surrey; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor John Pannett.  He had served since 2010.

After four by-elections in Kent past and present, we hop just over the county boundary into Surrey.  The village of Limpsfield, located on the slopes of the North Downs just north-east of Oxted and essentially an extension of it, is an old village notable for two mediaeval buildings: the twelfth-century timber-framed Old Court Cottage, once the home of Battle Abbey's manorial court; and St Peter's church which dates from the same era.  Buried in St Peter's churchyard are two of the towering figures in English classical music, the composer Frederick Delius and the conductor Sir Thomas Beecham; while more recent famous figures associated with the village include the England cricket captain Lord Cowdrey of Tonbridge and the TV host Davina McCall.  The census betrays that this is a middle-class commuter ward, with 53% of the workforce in management-level positions and 47% holding degree-level qualifications.

This is a true-blue area.  Limpsfield ward's boundaries are unchanged since the founding electoral arrangements for Tandridge district in 1973, and in all the years since then it has only twice failed to return a Conservative: in 1973 when the ward's two seats split between the Tories and Liberals, and in 1991 when the Tories stood down in favour of an independent candidate (who was later re-elected several times as a Conservative).  At the most recent poll in 2015 the Tories beat the Lib Dems here 70-12, and the local county council seat (Oxted) is also safely Conservative.  However, the previous results list doesn't take account of a new kid on the block, the localist Oxted and Limpsfield Residents Group; Limpsfield ward wasn't up in May, but the Residents contested and won the neighbouring ward of Oxted North and Tandridge.

Establishment candidates don't get much more establishment than the Tories' Neil O'Brien OBE; one of the few council by-election candidates to merit his own Wikipedia page, O'Brien was a former director of Policy Exchange, a centre-right think tank, before joining the Government in 2012 as a special advisor to George Osborne; he has been kept on as a SPAD by the May administration.  His opponents are Sheelagh Crampton of the Lib Dems, who fought the ward in 2014 and 2015; Simon Charles of Labour; and Phil Davies of the Residents Group.

BROADSTONE, Poole council, Dorset; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Joanne Tomlin on health grounds.  She had served since 2015.

We finish the week in Broadstone, a northern suburb of Poole which is still sufficiently semi-detached to be recognised as a separate town by the Post Office.  Broadstone's census statistics reveal a rather old, middle-class demographic: it is in the top 50 wards in England and Wales for owner-occupation (93% of households) and 21% of the workforce are retired.  Broadstone's traditional industry was lavender oil, but it's now an integral part of the Bournemouth-Poole conurbation and generally residential, with almost all of its housing being post-war.  The town's most notable resident was the evolutionary naturalist Alfred Russell Wallace, whose tomb in Broadstone cemetery is topped not by a traditional headstone but by a 7-foot-high fossilised treetrunk.

Broadstone's local elections are most certainly not fossilised, being closely fought between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats.  On its present boundaries the ward only dates from 2015 but is little changed from the 2003-15 Broadstone ward, which returned two Lib Dem councillors and one Conservative in 2003 but had a full Lib Dem slate in the 2007 and 2011 elections.  The Conservatives did well across Poole in the 2015 election and gained two seats in this ward, but couldn't knock out popular Lib Dem councillor Mike Brooke who topped the poll a long way ahead of his running-mates; Brooke's personal vote meant that the Lib Dems carried the ward 45-36.

So, an interesting contest is in prospect.  Defending for the Tories is Marc Ujvari, the losing Conservative candidate in 2015; he works in finance for Barclays.  The Lib Dems have selected Vikki Slade, who failed to hold the local parliamentary seat (Mid Dorset and North Poole) in the 2015 general election; she was a Poole councillor for this ward from 2011 to 2015 and is hoping to return to the council.  Also standing are Alan Gerring for UKIP, Mark Chivers for the Green Party and Jason Sanderson for Labour.
