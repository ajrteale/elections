There are again ten by-elections on 21st July 2016, nine in England and one in Wales.  The Lib Dems were the clear winner of last week's by-elections with four seat gains, but that's unlikely to be repeated this week as they are not in contention in any of the wards polling this week.  The Conservatives are defending six seats, two in Devon and one each in Lancashire, Northampton, Nottinghamshire and Surrey; Labour are defending two seats in London and one in Reading; and Plaid Cymru have a defence in Gwynedd.  We shouldn't expect much change this week: the three Labour defences and five of the six Tory seats are in safe wards and the Plaid defence shouldn't be too difficult unless local factors come into play, which leaves one standout marginal by-election...

CHORLEY RURAL NORTH, Lancashire county council; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Mike Devaney at the age of 78.  A former senior manager at British Gas, Devaney had served on Lancashire county council since 2009 and was chairman of the council in 2013-14.  He was also a former Chorley councillor, representing Clayton-le-Woods North ward from 2007 to 2011.

Last week this column went from south to north, so this week it's time to reverse the direction and go back south; the north is a particularly good place to start this week as possibly the most interesting by-election of the week is to Lancashire county council.  The Chorley Rural North county division is based on Clayton-le-Woods, a large affluent commuter village which occupies much of the space between Chorley and Bamber Bridge.  Smaller settlements in the division include Cuerden, Brindle and Hoghton; the division is also known for the fortified Elizabeth manor house of Hoghton Tower (pronounciation guide: HORton), still owned by the de Hoghton family, and the eighteenth-century Cuerden Hall, now a care home.

The three Chorley council wards in the division are an interesting bunch.  The rural Brindle and Hoghton is in the top 50 wards in England and Wales for Christianity (in a Lancashire context that usually means a large Catholic population), and has high levels of owner-occupation and a commuter economic profile.  Clayton-le-Woods North ward, which accounts for half the electorate, is more working-class, with high levels of social renting and long-term sickness.  Clayton-le-Woods West and Cuerden ward falls somewhere in between, with a high level of apprenticeships in its workforce.  

The political preferences of the three wards reflect their social composition: Clayton-le-Woods North, despite returning a full slate of Lib Dems in 2002 in a three-way marginal result, is a Labour-inclined marginal which the Tories did well to win at every election from 2004 to 2010; since the Tories got into government it has trended to Labour and in May Labour beat the Conservatives here 62-38 in a straight fight.  Clayton-le-Woods West and Cuerden is a key marginal which the Conservatives held 51-49 in 2014 and gained from Labour 52-48 at its most recent election in 2015.  Brindle and Hoghton ward is safe Conservative, although the Tories were run close by an independent in May's election.  The presence of Brindle and Hoghton makes the county division as a whole a Tory-inclined marginal, in which Labour are competitive but can't quite get over the line: at the last county election in 2013 the Conservatives had 41% to 38% for Labour and 17% for UKIP.

Defending for the Conservatives is Alan Cullens, Chorley councillor for Clayton-le-Woods West and Cuerden since 2015 and previously for Clayton-le-Woods North from 2008 to 2012; he fought Chorley in the 2010 general election.  Labour have reselected their 2013 candidate Yvonne Hargreaves, who fought Brindle and Hoghton in May.  The UKIP candidate is Christopher Suart, and the Lib Dems' Stephen Fenn completes the ballot paper.

BALDERTON SOUTH, Newark and Sherwood council, Nottinghamshire; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Gordon Brooks at the age of 72.  A former apprentice engineer at the Worthington Simpson pump works in Balderton, he rose by the time of his retirement in 2006 to be chief inspector of Ministry of Defence contracts.  His local government career started in 1987 on Balderton parish council; he was first elected to Newark and Sherwood council in a 1990 by-election, had continuous service from 2003 and was chairman of the council in 2008-09.  He leaves behind his wife Betty, also a Newark and Sherwood councillor, two children and four grandchildren.

One of the largest villages in Nottinghamshire, Balderton is a Newark suburb, just outside the town on the Great North Road towards London.  The major employer is Flowserve (originally Worthington Simpson), a company which manufactures pumps for the chemical, water and pharmaceutical industries, and that gives the area a slightly more working-class profile than might be expected from a suburb.

Not that that stops the Conservatives, who have a lock on all Balderton's council seats.  It helps that the opposition are disorganised here: since 2007 the Tories have been guaranteed one of the two seats in Balderton South (and its predecessor ward, Balderton West) because only one opposition candidate stood.  In 2015 (the only previous result on the current boundaries) that was a Labour candidate, whom the Tory slate beat 57-43.  The Conservatives also hold the wider Balderton seat on Nottinghamshire county council.

This by-election is also a straight fight.  In the blue corner is Lydia Hurst, a Balderton parish councillor for the ward.  In the yellow corner is Marylyn Rayner, chair of the Lib Dems' Newark branch.

WESTONE, Northampton council; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Matthew Lynch, who has moved away from the town.  He had served on Northampton council since 2011, and before then on Kettering council from 2003 to 2011.

For the first proper urban preview of the week, we move south to Northampton.  An old town with a manufacturing base (particularly boots and shoes), Northampton has greatly expanded since the Second World War as a result of being designated a New Town, and its population is still growing strongly.  The Westone area is mostly New Town development in the east of the town around Northampton College, one of the largest FE colleges in the Midlands; it's generally one of the better-off parts of town and scores well on the deprivation indices.

Westone ward was created for the 2011 election from part of the old Headlands ward, which was safe Lib Dem; however, the disastrous Lib Dem administration in Northampton in 2007-11 helped the Tories to win Westone in 2011, and they increased their majority in 2015 to 56-31 over Labour.  The remaining Headlands ward (now safe Labour) anchors a county division which covers much of Westone ward and was a three-way Labour/UKIP/Conservative marginal in the 2013 county elections; the rest of Westone is covered by the safe Tory county division of Boothville and Parklands.

Defending for the Conservatives is Greg Lunn, a fitness instructor who fought the town-centre Castle ward in 2015.  The Labour candidate is Toby Birch, chairman of the local charity Community Space Northampton.  Hoping to make a comeback is Brian Markham, former district councillor for the area and the Lib Dem candidate here in 2011 and 2015; he completes the ballot paper.

EXMOUTH LITTLEHAM, and HONITON ST MICHAEL'S, East Devon council; caused respectively by the death of Alison Greenhalgh and the resignation of David Foster, both of whom were Conservative councillors.  Greenhalgh, a former headteacher and OFSTED inspector, had served since 2011.  Foster, who in 2012 became the youngest ever mayor of Honiton at 35, had also served since 2011; he cites work and family commitments for his resignation.

For the week's two West Country by-elections we are in small towns in eastern Devon.  Exmouth, Devon's fifth largest town, is a tourist centre at this time of year and a commuter town for Exeter, but its major function out of season is as a retirement centre: Exmouth Littleham ward is in the top 100 in England and Wales for population aged 65 and over (37%) and 27% of the workforce are retired.  Littleham, named after one of the former parishes covering the town, is Exmouth's southern ward covering the town's coastline, most of the beach and the beauty spot of Orcombe Point, which marks the western end of the Jurassic Coast.

Further inland is Honiton St Michael's, the western of the two wards covering Honiton.  Honiton is an old market town on the Fosse Way and the A30 London-Exeter road, known for its Georgian architecture (largely a product of the town having been mostly destroyed by fire in the mid-eighteenth century) and its traditional lace-making industry; one strange custom which took place this week is the annual Hot Pennies ceremony, dating from the Anarchy, in which warm pennies are thrown from balconies in the High Street to crowds of local people.  The ward also includes a small part of the town which has spilled over the town boundary into Gittisham parish.  No doubt some electors will be delighted to know that their polling station is a pub - the Heathfield Inn.

East Devon is a very strong Tory district and much of the opposition to them comes from independents: an independent slate, the Independent East Devon Alliance, came from nowhere to become the official opposition on the council after the 2015 council election, and on the same day in the general election independent county councillor Claire Wright finished second in the East Devon constituency with 24% of the vote.  Exmouth Littleham returned two Lib Dems and one Conservative in the 2003 election but has had a full slate of Tories since 2007.  In 2015 the Tory slate polled 43% and were opposed by single candidates from four parties who were all closely bunched together: the Independent East Devon Alliance were runners-up on 31%, with the Greens last on 28% and the Lib Dems and UKIP in between.  Honiton St Michael's has been Tory at every ordinary election this century but a by-election in February 2009 narrowly elected a Lib Dem; last year the Tory slate led with 43% to 23% for the UKIP slate, 22% for the Independent East Devon Alliance candidate and 21% for independent candidate John Taylor.

At county council level Exmouth Littleham is combined with the Lib Dem ward of Exmouth Town to create a very marginal Lib Dem county division - the Lib Dem majority was cut to 10 votes in 2009 before increasing to 75 votes in the 2013 election.  The Honiton St Michael's county division takes in the rural Coly Valley ward, and is a Tory-held marginal: in 2009 the Tory lead was 6 points over the Lib Dems, in 2013 they were eight points ahead of UKIP. 

The Exmouth Littleham by-election is a three-way fight with the Independent East Devon Alliance, UKIP and the Greens withdrawing from the fray.  The defending Tory candidate Bruce de Saram is fighting his second by-election campaign in three months after being elected to Exmouth town council from this ward in April.  The Lib Dems have selected Alex Sadiq; she is secretary of a vehicle repair company with the puntastic name of Exepress Autos.  Completing the ballot paper is Labour's Keith Edwards.

To hold Honiton St Michael's the Tories have turned to Jenny Brown, a hotelier who fought Seaton ward last year.  UKIP have reselected Ashley Alder who was top of their slate here last year; she is the Deputy Mayor of Honiton for 2016-17 and represents this ward on the town council.  Another town councillor for this ward is Jeff Taylor, the independent candidate fom 2015 who now has the Independent East Devon Alliance nomination.  Completing the ballot paper is town councillor Henry Brown, standing for Labour.

SOUTHCOTE, Reading council, Berkshire; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Matt Lawrence due to pressure of work.  He had served since a July 2014 by-election and was elected to a full term in 2015.

The Southcote ward of Reading can be found on the south-western edge of the town along the A4 Bath Road.  It is named after the former Southcote Manor, much of whose land was developed into the ward's housing during the twentieth century.  The lords of Southcote Manor supplied several MPs for Reading over the centuries, including the regicide MP Daniel Blagrave who inherited the manor from the Tudor mathematician John Blagrave.  The ward includes another mansion whose land has been preserved as Prospect Park.

Southcote has returned Labour councillors consistently since the current ward boundaries were drawn up, and under current political conditions is a safe ward.  The Tories run a rather distant second here; in May Labour's lead over the Conservatives was 64-25.

Defending for Labour is Dr Jason Brock, a teaching fellow in Modern British and Intellectual History at Royal Holloway, University of London, and chairman of the party's Reading branch.  The Tories have reselected their regular candidate for the ward Russell Martin; also standing are Mark Cole for the Lib Dems (who stood here in May) and Alan Lockey for the Green Party.

WARLINGHAM WEST, Tandridge council, Surrey; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Glynis Whittle, who had served since 2000; she was chairman of the council in 2008-09 and chairman of the Conservatives' East Surrey branch.

Welcome to commuterland.  This is not just commuterland, this is Southern Railway commuterland, although somehow the lines serving Warlingham (the Caterham and Oxted branches) have escaped unscathed in the mayhem caused by Southern's current emergency timetable.  Warlingham itself, on the escarpment of the North Downs, has all the demographic indicators you'd expect for a commuter area: owner-occupation rates are high (89%) and 46% of the workforce are in some sort of management or professional occupation.

The ward is as Conservative as you might expect and the party is not seriously challenged.  In May's ordinary election the Lib Dems regained second place after losing it to UKIP in 2014, but still trailed the Tories 57-21.

Defending for the Conservatives is Keith Prew, who represents the ward on Warlingham parish council.  The Lib Dems have reselected their May candidate Celia Caulcott, an academic and vice-provost at UCL, and UKIP's Martin Haley completes the ballot paper.

BELLINGHAM, Lewisham council, South London; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Ami Ibitson who is taking up a new role in Sadiq Khan's administration at City Hall as, according to her Twitter, an "aspiring professional transport geek".  She had served on Lewisham council since 2006.

Moving over the Greater London boundary, we are now in South London in Bellingham, one of the "cottage estates" built by the London County Council in the immediate aftermath of the First World War.  While the Bellingham estate dominates the ward named after it, also within the ward are Lower Sydenham and Bell Green; the Bell Green area is being regenerated, with a high-end retail park opening recently on the site of a former gasworks.  The Bellingham and Beckenham Hill railway stations, on Thameslink's Blackfriars-Sevenoaks line, are on the eastern boundary of the ward, while the non-estate parts of the ward are served by Lower Sydenham station on the Hayes (Kent) branch.

Bellingham's census indicators bear the hallmarks of a former council estate, with 44% of the households still being socially rented.  The estate has seen significant immigration from Nigeria, and the ward is in the top 50 in England and Wales for black population (34%) and mixed-race population (7.5%).  Unemployment and associated indicators are high.  The result of this is a Labour ward which is not under serious threat from anybody else; in the 2014 election the Labour slate had 54%, with second place taken by a local left-wing group called People Before Profit who had 13%, just ahead of the Tory slate which had the same score.  In May's mayoral election Sadiq Khan beat Zac Goldsmith here 56-19, while in the London Members ballot Labour had 55% to 14% for the Tories and 9% for UKIP.

Defending for Labour is Sue Hordijenko, a former Director of Programmes at the British Science Association.  The People Before Profit candidate is David Hamilton, a piano teacher and lecturer.  The Tories have selected Ross Archer, who works for a not-for-profit organisation helping companies and consumers from falling victim to financial crime.  Also standing are Ed Veasey for the Lib Dems and Edwin Smith for UKIP.

HACKNEY CENTRAL, Hackney council, North London; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Sophie Linden who is taking up a new role in Sadiq Khan's administration at City Hall as Deputy Mayor for policing and crime.  She had served on Hackney council since 2006, initially for Dalston ward before moving to Hackney Central ward in 2014.

This is, as stated, Hackney's central ward.  Hackney was an important village in Tudor times, and St Augustine's Tower survives from that period as the only vestige of mediaeval Hackney.  The growth of London caught up with Hackney in Victorian times and much of the ward's housing stock is still from that era, although Hackney Town Hall is a good example of 1930s municipal architecture; on the same square as the Town Hall is the Hackney Empire, a theatre on whose stage Charlie Chaplin and Marie Lloyd (who lived around the corner in Graham Road) performed.  The ward is served by two railway stations, Hackney Central on the North London line and Hackney Downs on the West Anglia main line.

Hackney is deprived, inner-city London with high levels of unemployment and a fair number of students; the ward is in the top 100 in England and Wales for black population (30%), mixed-race population (7.1%), social renting (51% of households) and Buddhism (1.8%).  The present ward boundaries only date from 2014 when the Labour slate beat the Greens 64-23, although the Hackney Central ward which existed from 2002 to 2014 was very similar both in boundary and political profile.  In May Sadiq Khan beat the Green Party mayoral candidate Sian Berry 71-11; the Labour/Green margin was closer in the London Members ballot at 65-16, with third place in that vote going to the Women's Equality Party who polled 5%.

Defending for Labour is another Sophie, Sophie Conway, who is a youth advocate for a children's charity.  The Green candidate is Siobhan MacMahon, a former co-chair of the Green Party's youth wing.  Also standing are Russell French for the Lib Dems, former Hackney councillor Christopher Sills for the Conservatives, and independent Mustafa Korel.

WAUNFAWR, Gwynedd council; caused by the resignation of Plaid Cymru councillor Eurig Wyn.  One of Plaid's most prominent politicians, Wyn started his political career on the old Gwynedd county council in 1989, and was one of the two Plaid Cymru members of the European Parliament from 1999 to 2004.  He returned to Gwynedd council in 2012, and has resigned for personal reasons.

For the fourth and final North Wales by-election of the month, we move away from the coast and inland.  One of the two highest electoral units in England and Wales, the Waunfawr division is a large mountainous area, most of which (including Waunfawr village itself) is within the Snowdonia National Park.  Waunfawr and Caeathro, a village just outside Caernarfon, are the main centres of population; the Caernarfon-Beddgelert road and the recently reopened Welsh Highland Railway link the division together, and there are no fewer than four narrow-gauge railway stations within the division boundary, three on the Welsh Highland and one - the summit station - on the Snowdon Mountain Railway.  The summit of Snowdon itself lies on the division boundary.

It took until 2012 for there to be a contested election in Waunfawr this century, with Wyn challenging the sitting independent councillor Gwilym Williams and winning 57-43.  So, not much previous form to go on.  This by-election is again a straight fight, betwen Plaid's Edgar Wyn Owen, who runs a social enterprise for people with learning difficulties, and Labour's Paul Scott, a journalist and NUJ executive member.

--- LATE NOTICE ---

GREAT WYRLEY TOWN, South Staffordshire council; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Brian Bates.  He had served since winning a by-election in November 2005.

There's no central register of local by-elections; while the political parties' crowdsourcing efforts are usually good sometimes one slips through the net.  Such was the case with this poll in Great Wyrley Town, which only reached your columnist's notice on the weekend before polling day.

Great Wyrley itself is a post-industrial village lying just outside the West Midlands metropolitan boundary; it runs immediately south from the M6 Toll junction T7 along the Walsall-Cannock road.  Historically the village was known for coalmining - the collieries being connected to the outside world by the now-derelict Wyrley and Essington Canal - and for the Great Wyrley Outrages, a series of livestock killings in the early 20th century. George Edalji, the son of the local vicar (who was originally a Parsee from Bombay, and may have been the first south Asian to be an English vicar) was convicted of one of the killings, but later exonerated thanks to detective work by Arthur Conan Doyle.  Served by Landywood station on the Cannock Chase line, the ward is in the top 50 in England and Wales for population born in the UK (98.5%); economically it's mixed but mostly in the better half of the deprivation indices.

That gives the Tories the edge in what has become a safe ward for them.  In last year's ordinary election the Tory slate polled 67%, to 37% for the Labour slate and 31% for a single UKIP candidate.  The Tories also hold the the two Staffordshire county council seats for the local division (Cheslyn Hay, Essington and Great Wyrley) which was a Tory-UKIP marginal in 2013.

Defending for the Tories is one of those county councillors, Mike Lawrence.  He is opposed by two reselected candidates from 2015, Ken Bullock for Labour and Malcolm McKenzie for UKIP.
