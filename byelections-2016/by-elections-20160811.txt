IRVINE WEST, North Ayrshire council; caused by the resignation of SNP councillor Ruth Maguire, who was elected to Holyood in May as the MSP for Cunninghame South.

For the first of the week's two Scottish by-elections we are in Ayrshire in a town both old and New.  Irvine was one of Scotland's most important towns in the Middle Ages as one of the major ports on the west coast; although the port declined during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries it remained strategically important as a base for the ICI-Nobel explosives factory in nearby Stevenston.  Famous people associated with the old town include Edgar Allen Poe, who attended the local grammar school for a short time, and Robert Burns who worked for some months at a local heckling shop - not the council chamber but a location for preparing flax for spinning.

Irvine was changed out of all recognition in the 1960s by being designated as a New Town, and now has a population of around 34,000, with construction and retail being the major sectors of the local economy.  In its New Town guise Irvine has given Scotland not one but two First Ministers - Jack McConnell, who was brought up on Arran but born here, and a then 21-year-old law student who appeared on the ballot paper in 1992 for Irvine North ward in the last elections to Cunninghame district council, shortly after being the SNP candidate in Glasgow Shettleston in the previous month's general election - Nicola Sturgeon, the present First Minister of Scotland.  

Sturgeon's old stomping ground has voted Nationalist at every level since 2012, even in the independence referendum in which the ward was 50.6% Yes.  However, Scotland's local councils were last elected in 2012 which was before Labour fell apart in the country, and in the 2012 elections to Irvine West ward Labour topped the poll with 40% to 37% for the SNP and 12% for the Conservatives.  In the previous 2007 election Labour had won two seats to one each for the SNP and Tories, but the Tory seat was only won because the SNP only stood one candidate that year; in 2012 the SNP made no such mistake and Ruth Maguire narrowly beat the Tories to gain the final seat by 67 votes.

Defending for the SNP is a semi-celebrity candidate: Robin Sturgeon, father of Nicola.  Labour have selected Louise McPhater, a mother of four children who works at a local community centre.  The Tory candidate is Angela Stephen; also standing are Nick Smith for the Lib Dems, regular Socialist Labour Party candidate Bobby Cochrane and the ward's first Green candidate Joan McCormick.  As with all Scottish local by-elections since the introduction of PR in 2007, the Alternative Vote will be used.  No doubt all the candidates will be hoping to live up to the old motto of the Royal Burgh of Irvine: Tandem bona causa triumphat (the good cause triumphs in the end).
