"All the right votes, but not necessarily in the right order"
</blockquote>

Well, you have to start somewhere.  Welcome to Andrew's Previews' countdown to the May 2021 elections, which promise (in that hazy, faraway fantasy called the future) to be one of the biggest electoral events of this Parliament.  The whole of Great Britain is due to go to the polls.  And there's not just one type of election involved: many voters will have two, three or (in some cases) four ballot papers to juggle, and multiple electoral systems abound.  It's complicated.

For this reason there will be a long series (quite a long series) of Preview pieces.  I'm going to start by setting out the scene in the north-east of England.  Here we have up for election the police and crime commissioners for Northumbria, Durham and Cleveland; the Mayors of the Tees Valley and North Tyneside; and elections for a third of the five Tyne and Wear boroughs and the whole of Northumberland, Durham and Hartlepool councils.

<h2>Comparisons</h2>

The hybrid nature of the May 2021 elections means that any comparison is inevitably going to be confusing.  There are two different baselines to consider.

Most of the posts up for election next year were last filled in 2016, which was a very close set of local elections in England: the BBC's Projected National Share put Labour under Jeremy Corbyn on 31%, the Conservatives under David Cameron on 30%, the Lib Dems on 15% and UKIP on 12%.  In the Scottish Parliament, the SNP gained vote share but lost its overall majority; the party has been running Holyrood as a minority since.  Labour fell short of a majority in the National Assembly for Wales (as it was then), but stayed in power with the support of the single Liberal Democrat member.  Sadiq Khan gained the London mayoralty for Labour following the retirement of Boris Johnson who had chosen re-enter politics on the national stage, with some success.  Finally, the second set of Police and Crime Commissioner elections saw a bonfire of many of the independents who had been elected on comedy turnouts in November 2012.

May 2016 was very much another time, and by May 2017 things were very different.  This set of local elections came slap-bang in the middle of Theresa May's snap election campaign, and very much in her honeymoon period.  The BBC's Projected National Share had an eleven-point Conservative lead, with 38% against 27% for Labour and 18% for the Liberal Democrats.  With 2017 being (in England) essentially a county council year, and with UKIP having done well in the 2013 county elections, that resulted in big seat gains for the Conservatives who gained Derbyshire from Labour and won majorities in Cambridgeshire, East Sussex, Gloucestershire, Lancashire, Lincolnshire, Norfolk, Suffolk, Warwickshire and the Isle of Wight.

So, let's break down the country into its police areas and see what's going on.

<h2>Northumbria</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

Vera Baird, the former Labour MP for Redcar, was Northumbria PCC from 2012 until 2019 when she resigned to become Victims' Commissioner for England and Wales.  The resulting by-election, held in July 2019, saw Labour's Kim McGuinness, a Newcastle upon Tyne city councillor, take the lead on first preferences: 38%, against 22% each for two Northumberland councillors, independent candidate Georgina Hill and Conservative Robbie Moore; the Lib Dems coming in fourth and last with 19%.  Having placed second narrowly ahead of Moore, Hill got into the runoff and picked up most of the transfers, meaning that McGuinness was elected in the final reckoning by the narrow margin of 52-48.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

The whole of Northumberland county council is up for election along with one-third of the seats in the five Tyne and Wear boroughs and the elected mayoralty of North Tyneside.

<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2017/northumberland17.png" />

The Conservatives almost won an overall majority in Northumberland in May 2017.  Their 12 net gains, for a total of 33 seats, were mostly due to a collapse by the Lib Des who lost all their seats in the Berwick upon Tweed constituency.  However, the Conservatives did also gain two seats in Cramlington (one of them from Laura Pidcock, who subsequently had an ill-starred Parliamentary career in North West Durham) and tied for first place in the South Blyth division whose Lib Dem councillor was re-elected on the returning officer's drawing of lots.  This was a sign of things to come: Cramlington and Blyth are both in the Blyth Valley constituency which was the first Conservative gain of the December 2019 general election.  With 33 seats against 24 for Labour, 7 independents and 3 Lib Dems the Conservatives formed a minority administration, although they're a man down at the moment after Robbie Moore (their candidate in the Northumbria PCC by-election) was elected in December as MP for Keighley.  His seat in Alnwick is vacant.  Laura Pidcock's father died in 2019; he was a Northumberland councillor, and Labour held the resulting by-election in Holywell division.

<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/sunderland19.png" />

The largest of the five Tyne and Wear boroughs is another early declarer: the city of Sunderland.  This column wrote in 2019 that Sunderland has a Labour administration which is very locally unpopular while also having a very secure majority, and despite the fact that Labour lost 12 councillors in 2019 that's still true.  The Labour group currently has 51 seats (one of which is vacant), against 12 Conservatives, 8 Lib Dems, 3 UKIPpers and 1 Green.  There are 10 wards with split representation and Labour are defending every single one of them; but for the party's majority to be in serious danger they'd have to do far worse even than in 2019.

<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/newcastletyne19.png" />

Things are much more secure for Labour in the other four Tyne and Wear boroughs.  In Newcastle upon Tyne the party has 54 seats (four of which are vacant) against 20 Lib Dems and four independents and localists.  A repeat of the 2019 results would see Labour lose three seats: North Jesmond and Ouseburn to the Lib Dems, and Callington and Throckley ward to the localists.

<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/ntyneside19.png" />

North Tyneside is different to the other four Tyne and Wear boroughs in that it has an elected mayor.  The mayoralty has been held by both Labour and the Conservatives in the past with a number of very close results, but the last mayoral election in 2017 had a big lead for Labour's Norma Redfearn who was re-elected in the first round with a 56-31 lead over the Conservatives.  Labour hold 51 of the 60 seats on the council (one of which is vacant) against 7 Conservatives, a Lib Dem and an independent; a repeat of the 2019 results would see the Conservatives gain Cullercoats and Tynemouth wards from Labour, but Labour would gain Monkseaton North from the Conservatives and also pick up the Lib Dem seat in Northumberland ward.  In the event that the Conservatives gain the mayoralty, it's likely that the new mayor will have to cohabit with a Labour-majority council.

<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/gateshead19.png" />

Gateshead is a borough where very little seems to change from election to election.  There are currently 52 Labour seats (one of which is vacant) against 12 Lib Dems and two independent councillors who were elected on the Lib Dem ticket.  One of the defectors (in Whickham South and Sunniside) is up for re-election next year.  A repeat of the 2019 results would result in no change to the Labour total.

<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/styneside19.png" />

South Tyneside, on the other hand, had some excitement in the 2019 elections where Labour lost five seats, four to independents and the other (Beacon and Bents ward, covering South Shields town centre) to the Green Party.  There has been some infighting in the Labour group since, with the council leader resigning his seat.  In 2016 Labour won a clean sweep of all 18 wards, some of which may prove tricky to defend; although with 47 seats out of a possible 54 it is impossible for the party to lose its majority here.

<h2>Durham</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

Ron Hogg, who had led the English police response against football hooliganism during the 2002 FIFA World Cup in Japan and South Korea, had been the Durham PCC since 2012.  Hogg died in December 2019 and his deputy, Steven White, is serving as PCC in an acting capacity until an election can be held.  Hogg had been re-elected in the first round in 2016, defeating the Conservatives 64-24.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2017/durham17.png" />

There are whole council elections this year for Durham council.  The last elections here were in 2017 and left Labour with a reduced majority.  They won 74 seats against 25 for various categories of independents and localists, 14 for the Liberal Democrats (who are particularly strong in Durham city), 10 Conservatives and 3 seats for the North East Party, a regionalist movement with a powerbase in the New Town of Peterlee.  None of the ten Conservative councillors were elected in the North West Durham constituency, which the party now holds in Westminster.  There have been six by-elections since 2017, with Labour holding three, the Lib Dems holding one and (in May 2019) gaining Shildon and Dene Valley from Labour, and a very fragmented by-election in Spennymoor in May 2019 which saw an independent candidate finish in first place with just 19% of the vote, succeeding a different independent.

There are no local elections this year in Darlington, but that borough will take part in the Tees Valley mayoral election discussed in the next section.

<h2>Cleveland</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

The Cleveland PCC since 2012 has been Labour's Barry Coppinger, a Labour man who had previously sat on Middlesbrough council.  Having already announced his retirement, Coppinger resigned as PCC in 2020 and his deputy has taken over for the rest of his term.  Coppinger was re-elected in 2016 with a 62-38 lead over the Conservatives in the runoff.

<h3>Tees Valley mayoralty</h3>

The Tees Valley mayoral election the following year told a completely different story.  The electorate here consists of the four Cleveland boroughs plus Darlington, and the addition of Darlington made all the difference.  Ben Houchen, who had previously been leader of the Conservative group on Stockton-on-Tees council, was elected as the first Mayor of the Tees Valley by the narrow margin of 51.1% to 48.9% over Labour in the runoff, having led 39.5-39.0 on first preferences.  With the Conservatives having gained three seats here in December 2019 (plus the Sedgefield constituency, part of which is in Darlington borough), and with local elections across the area since 2017 having been dire for Labour, Houchen must be fairly confident about the prospect of re-election.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/hartlepool19.png" />

The only council in Cleveland holding ordinary local elections this year is Hartlepool, where local politics has been bizarre for many years and seems to have got more so since the Monkey Mayor left the scene.  All simian and indeed human life is here, and the council membership is the broadest of broad churches with members from the Socialist Labour Party at one end of the political spectrum, the For Britain Movement at the other end and representatives of nearly every viewpoint in between.  The Scargillite group is in fact the former Labour council leadership following a split in early 2019; that split and six seat losses for Labour in May 2019 means that the town is now in the hands of a group which was originally called the Independent Union, before affiliating to the Brexit Party, before leaving the Brexit Party and becoming the Independent Union again.  They are running the show in alliance with those obvious political bedfellows the Scargillites and the Conservatives.  The usual medicine for political basket cases like Hartlepool is to hit the reset button with an all-out election, and as luck would have it the Local Government Boundary Commission were in town recently so there will be an all-out election in 2021 on new ward boundaries.

<h2>Cumbria</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

The Cumbria PCC position has been held by the Conservatives since 2012.  Peter McCall, a former Army officer who commanded a squadron during the Bosnian war, has served since 2016.  On the first count he had 34% of the vote against 24% for Labour, 17% for the Lib Dems and 15% for an independent candidate; in the runoff McCall defeated the Labour candidate by 58-42.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

There are elections this year for the whole of Cumbria county council and one-third of Carlisle and South Lakeland councils.

Cumbria county council has been hung for many years.  In 2017 the Conservatives won the most seats, 37, but were shut out by a coalition of Labour (26) and the Lib Dems (16) with the other five seats going to independent councillors.  As can be seen, the ruling coalition controls half the seats; and with Labour performing relatively poorly in the 2019 local elections (particularly in West Cumbria, where they have eight seats to defend) the Tories will have legitimate hopes of being in a position to be able to form some kind of administration of their own at the County Hall in Carlisle.

Labour lost control of Carlisle city council in the 2019 elections, at which new ward boundaries came into force which reduced the number of councillors from the city proper.  The Conservatives are now the largest party, with 17 seats won in 2019 against 15 for Labour, 4 independents and a councillor each from the Greens, UKIP and the Lib Dems.  The Green seat (in normally-Tory Belah and Kingsmoor) and the UKIP seat (which they won by 1 vote in normally-Labour Currock and Upperby) are both up for re-election this year, while Labour are defending Sandsfield and Morton West where the other two seats are Conservative.

On the other hand, the Conservatives performed poorly in May 2019 in South Lakeland district where they lost four seats, three to the ruling Lib Dems and one to the Greens (in Ulverston West).  At the time of writing the Lib Dems hold 32 seats (two of which are vacant) against 16 Conservative seats (two of which are vacant), 2 Labour and one Green.  The baseline here is from 2018 when the current ward boundaries came in, and in wards which are politically-split the Conservatives are defending five seats and the Lib Dems four seats; if the 2019 results are repeated the Lib Dems would gain three seats and the Greens would gain one.

<h2>Lancashire</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

The Lancashire police and crime commissioner is Labour's Clive Grunshaw.  In May 2016 he polled 44% in the first round against 32% for the Conservatives and 17% for UKIP, and went on to win the run-off by a 56-44 margin.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

There are elections this year for the whole of Lancashire county council, the whole of Chorley and Pendle councils on new ward boundaries, and one-third of Blackburn with Darwen, Burnley, Hyndburn, Preston, Rossendale and West Lancashire councils.

Lancashire county council has swung rather wildly in recent years: Labour in 2005, Conservative in 2009, hung in 2013 with Labour as the largest party, Conservative in 2017.  That election returned 46 Conservative councillors against 30 Labour, 4 Lib Dems, 2 independents, a Green councillor and the only UKIP councillor returned in 2017 (in Padiham ad Burnley West; he is now in the Conservative group).  The Tories had a majority of 8 seats which rests on particularly good results in marginal Rossendale and Colne and the New Town territory of Leyland.  There are a large number of marginal divisions in these areas, and on current polling this will be a difficult council for the Conservatives to defend.

The Conservatives did particularly well in East Lancashire at the 2019 general election, but generally this wasn't off a strong local government base.  Their strongest council is Pendle covering the towns of Nelson and Colne, but the Conservatives lost control here in May 2019 to a Labour/Lib Dem coalition.  There are new ward boundaries in Pendle this year with all the seats up for election; at the time of writing the Conservatives hold 22 seats (two of which are vacant), Labour 16 (one of which is vacant), the Lib Dems have 10 and there is one independent.  One of the Tory vacancies is in respect of the new Bury South MP Christian Wakeford, who was the group leader here before he entered the Commons; Wakeford was subsequently thrown off Pendle council under the six-month non-attendance rule, which doesn't say much for his organisational skills.

Further down the Calder valley we come to Burrnley, which elected MPs from all three main parties in the last decade but whose council elections tell a rather different story.  Labour lost their majority on Burrnley council in May 2019, and the council currently stands at 22 Labour seats against 8 Lib Dems, 7 localists and independents, 6 Tories (three of whom were elected on the UKIP ticket) and 2 Greens.  A rainbow anti-Labour coalition was formed after the 2019 election, but this fell apart in September 2020 and Labour are back in minority control.  If the 2019 results are repeated, Labour would lose Trinity ward to the Greens and Rosegrove with Lowerhouse to the localists.

Hyndburn district (based on Accrington) has a Tory MP now but a large Labour majority on its council, which currently stands at 26 Labour seats (one of which is vacant) and 9 Conservative seats (one of which is vacant).  The vacant seats are in the politically split wards of Barnfield (in eastern Accrington) and Overton (in Great Harwood).  A repeat of the 2019 results would result in those seats swapping to give no net change here.

By contrast Labour have a difficult defence of Rossendale council over the moors in the upper Irwell valley.  They currently hold 19 out of 36 councillors, against 13 Tories and 4 independents and localists.  This Labour are defending three wards which voted Conservative in 2019 together with Eden ward, a normally-Tory area which surprisingly went Labour in 2016 in the aftermath of severe flooding in Irwell Vale on Boxing Day 2015.  This is one to watch.

South-facing Rossendale is paired for parliamentary purposes with north-facing Darwen, which is part of the borough of Blackburn with Darwen.  This is strongly Labour (34 out of 51 seats at present) and if the 2019 results are repeated Labour would gain one seat from the Conservatives.

Perhaps surprisingly Labour have an even larger majority on Chorley council (37 out of 47 seats), having gained five seats here from the Conservatives in 2019.  There are new ward boundaries in Chorley this year, which may give the Tories some chance of fighting back although they start a long way behind.

New ward boundaries came in last year for Preston, resulting in a Labour majority with 30 seats against 9 each for the Tories and Lib Dems.  Only one ward could be reasonably described as marginal on the basis of the 2019 results (Tory-held Sharoe Green ward in Fulwood) so we shouldn't expect much change here.

West Lancashire elections are normally a snoozefest, this being an extremely polarised district where two-party swings are low; however, this year promises to be interesting.  Currently Labour have 29 seats, the Conservatives have 19 and there are 6 councillors from the OWL group.  The OWLs are not what they seem: the initials represent Our West Lancashire, a localist group which won all three wards in Ormskirk in the 2019 election.  This time round Labour are defending two of the Ormskirk wards, and if they lose them both it will probably be No Overall Control time.

<h2>Merseyside</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

The Merseyside PCC position is held by Labour's Jane Kennedy.  In 2016 she won in the first round with 62% of the vote, the Conservatives being her nearest challengers on 18%.

<h3>Liverpool City Region mayoral election</h3>

The Liverpool City Region mayoralty covers a larger area than just Merseyside, with the Halton borough covering the towns of Runcorn and Widnes up the Mersey estuary also included.  The first mayoral election was held in May 2017 and was a convincing win for the outgoing Liverpool Walton MP Steve Rotherham, who defeated Tory candidate Tony Caldeira in the first round by 59% to 20%.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

There are elections this year for one-third of all the Merseyside boroughs plus the elected mayoralty of Liverpool.

The Liverpool mayoralty is likely to be the main point of interest in the big city.  Labour's Joe Anderson performed poorly in 2016 relative to PCC Jane Kennedy; Big Joe won in the first round with 53% compared to 20% for the Liberal Democrats and 11% for the Green Party.  His legal troubles might cast a shadow.  Labour are in an impregnable position on the city council with 73 out of 91 seats; a repeat of the 2019 results would see them lose one seat nett to the Greens.

Labour control of Knowsley is also secure, despite a poor performance in the 2019 election - a repeat of that would see the Green Party gain two seats and an independent gain one.  A similar story played out in St Helens in 2019, where the Greens won two wards from nowhere and were close in a number of others; a repeat of those results would see Labour lose four seats.

By contrast Labour are on the rise in Sefton, having finally broken through into the traditional Lib Dem stronghold of Southport.  They have a good chance of four seat gains this year (two from the Lib Dems in Southport, two from independents in Maghull) to increase the Labour majority.  Currently Labour hold 43 out of 66 seats here, which is a mark of how far this area has swung to the left: Sefton had never had a Labour majority before 2012.

The Labour majority over the water in Wirral council has disappeared since the 2019 election partially as a result of infighting following a left-wing takeover.  There are three wards with split representation, and this year Labour are defending all of them: Birkenhead/Tranmere and Prenton voted Green in 2019, whereas Pensby and Thingwall voted Conservative.

<h2>Cheshire</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

David Keane gained the Cheshire PCC post for Labour from the Conservatives in 2016.  On first preferences he had 40% of the vote to 38% for the Tories and 12% for UKIP; in the run-off Cheshire went Labour by the narrow margin of 51% to 49%, a majority of 2,949 votes.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

Following the 2019 local elections Labour, for the first time, have a monopoly on local government in Cheshire, running as a majority or as a minority all the local government districts which cover the county.  And this is true whatever current or historical definition of Cheshire you use.  Rather striking for the county that includes the richest areas of north-west England.

There are elections this year for all the councillors in Halton and Warrington, with new ward boundaries coming in for Halton.  Both of these councils have strong Labour majorities at present (51 out of 56 seats in Halton, 45 out of 58 seats in Warrington).  The Conservatives gained the Warrington South parliamentary seat in December 2019 but that wasn't based on local government strength: in 2016 the party won just two seats on Warrington council (in the Real Housewives territory of Lymm South) and one of those has since gone Lib Dem in a by-election.

There are no local elections of any sort this year in Cheshire East or in Cheshire West and Chester.

<h2>Greater Manchester</h2>

<h3>Mayor of Greater Manchester</h3>

The Greater Manchester mayoralty was created in 2017, subsuming the Police and Crime Commissioner post.  Andy Burnham had a big win in the inaugural GM mayoral election, crushing the Tory candidate Sean Anstee by 63% to 23% in the first round; a ward-level breakdown of the count was published, and the number of wards Anstee carried in the county can be counted on the fingers of two hands.  Nothing which has happened since 2017 suggests that Burnham will struggle for re-election.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

There are elections this year for the whole of Salford council on new ward boundaries, the Mayor of Salford, and one-third of the councillors in the other nine Greater Manchester boroughs.

The only Conservative-run metropolitan borough in the North of England is the Greatest Town in the Known Universe.  Following a decisive rejection of Labour in the 2019 election a minority Conservative administration (currently with 20 out of 60 councillors) was installed by a gaggle of localist groups, the Lib Dems and UKIP.  Labour are going to need to do a lot better than in 2019 to stem further seat losses (they are defending three or four wards which voted Tory, Lib Dem or localist last time out), so some sort of anti-Labour administration looks likely to continue.

The localist surge seen in Bolton could also cost Labour control of neighbouring Bury this year.  Bury currently has 28 Labour councillors, 16 Conservatives, 4 Lib Dems and 3 independents elected on a localism ticket in the forgotten town of Radcliffe, giving a Labour majority of 3.  In 2019 Labour lost Radcliffe North ward to the Conservatives, Radcliffe East ward to the localists and St Mary's ward in Prestwich to the Lib Dems; the localists subsequently took a by-election off Labour in working-class Radcliffe West.  While Labour do have chances to gain Conservative seats in Ramsbottom and Prestwich's Sedgley ward (which will be an interesting test of whether the party has sorted out its anti-Semitism problem), there are several other marginal wards which the Tories will have their eyes on, such as Elton and Unsworth.  This is one to keep an eye on.

The other major battle in Greater Manchester would appear to be for Stockport council.  This is currently tied at 26 seats each for Labour and the Lib Dems, with 8 Conservatives and three Heald Green ratepayers holding the balance of power.  In 2019 the Lib Dems gained five seats from the Conservatives and they have a chance of a further gain this year in Marple South and High Lane ward; that would probably make them the largest party on the council and could result in a change of control.

The other seven Greater Manchester boroughs have impregnable Labour majorities, and that includes Salford where all 60 councillors are up for re-election on new ward boundaries this year.  The new lines have created a completely new ward in the inner city, reflecting large housing developments under construction in the Quays area; the new Quays ward is hugely undersized at the moment in population terms but this should resolve itself over the next few years.  Salford has an elected mayor of its own, currently Labour's Paul Dennett who won the 2016 mayoral election in the first round: he polled 51% against 26% for the Conservatives and 16% for UKIP.
