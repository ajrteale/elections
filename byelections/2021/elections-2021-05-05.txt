"All the right votes, but not necessarily in the right order"
</blockquote>

Welcome to Andrew's Previews' countdown to the May 2021 elections, which promise to be the biggest electoral event of this Parliament.  The whole of Great Britain is due to go to the polls.  And there's not just one type of election involved: many voters will have two, three or (in some cases) four or more ballot papers to juggle, and multiple electoral systems abound.  It's complicated.

Because of its extraordinary length this Preview will be split into four parts, set out as follows:
<ol>
<li>Introduction, Scotland, Wales and London.
<li>The North and Midlands.
<li>The South and East.
<li>The Parliamentary Special; and concluding remarks.
</ol>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

The hybrid nature of the May 2021 elections means that any comparison is inevitably going to be confusing.  There are two different baselines to consider.

Most of the posts up for election next year were last filled in 2016, which was a very close set of local elections in England.  The BBC's Projected National Share put Labour under Jeremy Corbyn on 31%, the Conservatives under David Cameron on 30%, the Lib Dems on 15% and UKIP on 12%.  In the Scottish Parliament, the SNP gained vote share but lost its overall majority; the party has been running Holyrood as a minority since.  Labour fell short of a majority in the National Assembly for Wales (as it was then), but stayed in power with the support of the single Liberal Democrat member.  Sadiq Khan gained the London mayoralty for Labour following the retirement of Boris Johnson who had chosen to re-enter politics on the national stage, with some success.  Finally, the second set of Police and Crime Commissioner elections saw a bonfire of many of the independents who had been elected on comedy turnouts in November 2012.

May 2016 was very much another time, and by May 2017 things were very different.  This set of local elections came slap-bang in the middle of Theresa May's snap election campaign, and very much in her honeymoon period.  The BBC's Projected National Share had an eleven-point Conservative lead, with 38% against 27% for Labour and 18% for the Liberal Democrats.  With 2017 being (in England) essentially a county council year, and with UKIP having done well in the 2013 county elections, that resulted in big seat gains for the Conservatives who gained Derbyshire from Labour and won majorities in Cambridgeshire, East Sussex, Gloucestershire, Lancashire, Lincolnshire, Norfolk, Suffolk, Warwickshire and the Isle of Wight.

These previews will make a lot of comparisons with 2019, for the purpose of establishing something of a "par score".  The May 2019 local elections took place in a political scene much more like May 2016 than May 2017 and, unusually, happened at a time when <em>both</em> major parties were in a weak position but while the new forces taking votes off them, the Brexit Party and Change UK, were not ready for prime time.  While there was a lot of anti-incumbent sentiment about, those new parties were unable to take advantage as they had no candidates; so that anti-incumbent sentiment manifested itself in many areas with large shares for independent candidates and localist parties.  These small groups had been mostly swamped in 2015 by general election turnout, so 2019 marked something of a renaissance for them.

Since March 2020, local by-elections in England have been suspended due to reasons which are obvious.  Some local by-elections have taken place in Wales, and the Scottish returning officers have efficiently cleared their vacancy backlog, but in England we have no information from real-life elections as to how things are going.  We only have the national opinion polls, which suggest a national picture closer to 2017 than to 2016.  How this will translate into a series of local pictures is extremely difficult to predict, but one reasonable guess might be that the Conservatives consistently do better than the 2019 "par scores" set out in this preview.

The merging together of the 2020 and 2021 local elections, together with the filling of 352 casual vacancies, means that a total of exactly 5,000 councillors are up for election on 6th May.  In councillor terms, this is not the largest set of local elections in the UK - 2019 was larger - but in vote terms that definitely is the case.  Everybody in Great Britain has something to vote for, even if it's only the Police and Crime Commissioners.

Because of the limited space and time available and the extraordinary number of by-elections, I have applied a much stronger than usual filter when naming candidates in the 6th May previews.  All mayoral and PCC candidates have been namechecked, but by-election candidates are generally only named in this text if their party was within 10% last time out.  For a full list of by-election candidates I will refer you to <a href="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/2021-byelections.pdf">this file (link)</a>.  If you're a by-election candidate and you're not happy with not having your name in this preview, then I would love you to prove me wrong by going ahead and winning your contest.  In most cases you can click on each by-election's name to see previous results from the Local Elections Archive Project.  As usual, the maps are the results from 2016 or 2017 - one electoral cycle ago.

I am fully aware that there will be mistakes in this preview.  Have fun finding them.

To start off, here is Part I covering the three parts of Great Britain where there are no ordinary council elections this year: Scotland, Wales and London.

<h2>Scotland</h2>

<h3>Scottish Parliament</h3>

This piece is not going to look in any great detail at the Scottish Parliament elections.  There are plenty of other people doing this in far more detail than I can provide; I shall instead point you to Allan Fauld's <a href="https://ballotbox.scot/"><em>Ballot Box Scotland</em></a> blog, which is doing a sterling job in previewing this year's Holyrood polls.  The Britain Elects team have also been working on a prediction model.

The last Holyrood elections in May 2016 returned 63 Scottish National Party MSPs, 31 Conservatives, 24 Labour, 6 Greens and 5 Lib Dems.  The SNP formed a minority administration.  The Conservative MSP for Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire resigned in 2017 to seek election to the House of Commons, and the Conservatives held the resulting by-election (<em>Andrew's Previews 2017</em>, pages 143 to 150).  The Liberal Democrat MSP for the Shetland Islands resigned in 2019 to take up a new job and the Lib Dems held the resulting by-election (<em>Andrew's Previews 2019</em>, pages 260 to 268).  Five regional MSPs (four Conservatives and one Labour) have been replaced since 2016 by candidates from their party's list.

The Scottish Parliament election is being extensively polled.  At the time of writing, the polling indicates that the SNP government will be re-elected and there will probably again be a nationalist majority in the chamber - although whether the SNP can achieve an overall majority of their own or would need to rely on the Greens or other nationalist parties to govern remains an open question.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2017/stirling17.png" />

Scotland's returning officers have efficiently filled all the vacancies which arose last year.  The Scottish Parliament election for 2021 is combined with just one local by-election, in the <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i18544">Forth and Endrick</a> ward of Stirling council.  This is a large rural ward with no towns to speak of, located about 20 miles north of Glasgow beyond the Campsie fells.  The eastern bank of Loch Lomond, the Munro of Ben Lomond and the village of Drymen lie within the boundaries of the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park, while the ward extends east down the Forth valley as far as Gargunnock.  It's part of the Stirling constituency at both Holyrood and Westminster level.  The Stirling Holyrood seat has been SNP-held since 2007, but the Conservatives carried this ward in 2017 with a 45-30 vote lead and a 2-1 seat lead over the SNP.  The ward's SNP councillor Graham Lambie has died, and the Conservatives (who are the largest party on Stirling council, but in opposition to an SNP/Labour administration) are in a good position to gain a seat here.  The defending SNP candidate is Paul Goodwin, while Jane Hutchison challenges for the Conservatives.

<h2>Wales</h2>

<h3>Senedd Cymru</h3>

Senedd Cymru holds its fifth election in 2021, but the first under its current name: until last year, when the body was upgraded to a Parliament, it was known as the National Assembly for Wales.  The last elections in 2016 returned 29 Labour members, 12 Plaid Cymru, 11 Conservatives, 7 UKIP and a single Liberal Democrat who is not seeking re-election; the administration is a coalition of Labour, the Lib Dem and a Plaid Cymru defector who is not seeking re-election either.  The Labour AM for Alyn and Deeside took his own life at the end of 2017, and Labour held the resulting by-election in 2018 (<em>Andrew's Previews 2018</em>, pages 38 to 46).  Four regional MSs (two from Plaid and one each from the Conservatives and UKIP) have been replaced since 2016 by candidates from their party's list.  It may not surprise to learn that the UKIP group has fallen apart: Neil Hamilton, the notorious former Conservative MP for Tatton, is the only MS still in the party, while the former Conservative and UKIP MP Mark Reckless is seeking re-election to the Senedd for the single-issue Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party.

This Senedd Cymru election is also being extensively polled, but Wales is a difficult country to poll well and this is reflected in a lot of volatility in the pollsters' readings.  Although proportional representation is in use, forty of the sixty seats are single-member constituencies which can provide a big bonus for any party which does well in the constituencies.  Traditionally this is Labour, which won 27 of the 40 constituencies in 2016; however in the December 2019 general election the party only won 22 constituencies here, against 14 Conservatives and 4 for Plaid.  As such, any fall in the Labour constituency vote (which was 35% in 2016) could result in disproportionate seat changes.  The First Minister, Mark Drakeford, is sitting on a particularly small majority over Plaid Cymru in his Cardiff West constituency; but he's safer than he looks, partly because he has a huge national profile now, and partly because the Plaid candidate from 2016, Neil McEvoy, has been thrown out of the party and taken a large chunk of the local Plaid activists with him into his new pro-Welsh independence party, Propel.  If the polling is to be believed (and, as I say, it is volatile), then Welsh Labour are likely to continue in office with some form of support from Plaid Cymru.

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioners</h3>

Most of the focus of the 2021 elections in Wales will be on the Senedd, and with good reason.  However, Wales also has four police and crime commissioners to elect.  The 2016 Welsh PCC elections, also held alongside a Senedd poll, saw quite a lot of change due to the fact that they were contested by Plaid Cymru, who hadn't stood in 2012.

Plaid ended up gaining two PCC positions.  One of those was <b>North Wales</b> PCC, covering the old counties of Clwyd and Gwynedd and thus not quite the same as the North Wales electoral region of the Senedd.  That position was open following the retirement of 2012 winner Winston Roddick, who had won that year as an independent candidate despite being a Lib Dem party member.  (Roddick's political career went all the way back to the 1970 general election, in which he was the Liberal candidate for Anglesey.)  In 2016 the North Wales police area gave 31% to Plaid Cymru candidate Arfon Jones, 26% to Labour candidate David Taylor, 20% to the Conservatives and 12% to UKIP; Plaid picked up a lot of transfers to win the runoff against Labour 58-42.

Arfon Jones is standing down after one term and is replaced as Plaid candidate by Ann Griffith, an Anglesey county councillor.  Labour have selected Flintshire councillor Andy Dunbobbin, the Conservative candidate is former Mayor of Ruthin Pat Astbury, and UKIP have not returned.  Completing the ballot paper are independent Mark Young and Lisa Wilkins of the Lib Dems.

The 2012 election for <b>Dyfed-Powys</b> PCC had been a straight fight between the Conservatives and Labour, with the Tories' Christopher Salmon prevailing against former Welsh agriculture minister Christine Gwyther.  There was a wider field for the 2016 election, with Plaid Cymru candidate Dafydd Llywelyn leading the first count on 28% against 25% for Salmon, 19% for Labour and 11% for UKIP who narrowly beat the Lib Dems for fourth place.  In the runoff Llywelyn defeated Salmon by a 56-44 margin.  Llywelyn is seeking re-election against Conservative candidate Jon Burns (a former Welsh city and county councillor) and Labour's Philippa Thompson (a former diplomat who contested Preseli Pembrokeshire in December 2019).  Again, UKIP have not returned, so Tomos Preston of the Lib Dems completes the ballot paper.

The two PCC positions in industrial south Wales were both safely Labour.  A three-cornered contest in <b>Gwent</b> saw Labour lead in the first round with 46% against 31% for the Conservatives and 23% for Plaid; Plaid's transfers gave Labour a 62-38 win over the Conservatives in the runoff.  Incumbent Labour PCC Jeff Cuthburt is seeking re-election; the Tory candidate is Iraq veteran Hannah Jarvis, and Plaid have selected Caerphilly councillor Donna Cushing.  Also standing are independent candidate Paul Harley, Clayton Jones of the pro-Welsh independence party Gwlad, and John Miller of the Lib Dems.

In the <b>South Wales</b> police area (corresponding to the old county of Glamorgan) former First Minister Alun Michael was re-elected for a second term as PCC in 2016 without fuss.  Michael led in the first round with 41% of the vote.  A three-way contest for the other place in the run-off saw the Conservatives and Plaid poll 18% each with independent Mike Baker in fourth on 17%; the Tory candidate Timothy Davies finished second, just 29 votes ahead of Plaid (70,799 to 70,770).  That put Davies into the runoff, where he was duly crushed 68-32 by Michael.  Michael is seeking re-election for a third term; the Conservative candidate is Swansea councillor and former police officer Steve Gallagher; Plaid have selected criminal justice campaigner Nadine Marshall, whose son was murdered six years ago by a person who was on probation at the time; and independent Mike Baker is trying again.  Completing a six-strong ballot paper are Callum Littlemore of the Lib Dems and Gail John of Propel.

It should be noted that the elections in Wales on 6th May have different franchises.  If you are aged 16 or 17, or you are resident in Wales but not a citizen of a Commonwealth or EU country, then you cannot vote for your Police and Crime Commissioner but you can vote for the Senedd and in any local by-elections.  Which we shall come to next.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2017/flintshire17.png" />

There are no local elections in Wales this year, but there are ten council by-elections taking place.  One of these is a direct result of COVID-19, which has taken from us <b>Flintshire</b> county councillor Kevin Hughes.  He had served since 2017 as an independent councillor for <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i11753">Gwernymynydd</a> division, taking over an open seat after a long-serving Liberal Democrat councillor retired; the Lib Dems didn't put up a candidate to defend the seat, and Hughes picked it up with a 58-29 lead over the Conservatives.  Gwernymynydd is a village just south-west of Mold on the main road towards Ruthin, and the division includes a number of other hamlets to the south of Mold.  Kevin Hughes' son Andy is seeking to follow in his father's footsteps as an independent candidate, and is opposed only by Plaid Cymru's Bob Gaffey.

<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2017/anglesey17.png" />

At the far end of North Wales there are two by-elections to the <b>Isle of Anglesey</b> council.  <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i14801">Seiriol</a> division is the eastern end of the island, covering the town of Beaumaris and surrounding villages; <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i14797">Caergybi</a> division is the town of Holyhead, and as such is on the front line of Brexit as the main port of embarkation for Dublin and Dún Laoghaire.  The Caergybi division split its three seats between two independents and a Labour candidate in 2017; the late councillor Shaun Redmond was the second independent candidate, gaining his seat from Labour.  Independent candidate Ken Evans will seek to succeed Redmond, as will Labour's Jennifer Saboor.  Seiriol returned a full slate of Plaid Cymru candidates in 2017 and looks safe enough for the party, whose defending candidate is Gary Pritchard.

<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2017/newport17.png" />

The other seven by-elections are in the industrial south of the country.  <b>Newport</b>'s <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i11301">Victoria</a> division is on the east bank of the Usk immediately opposite the city centre; the division is centred on Rodney Parade, the home ground of the Dragons Pro14 rugby side.  Victoria was the first division in Wales to elect a Muslim local councillor, Mohammad Asghar, who was returned here as a Plaid Cymru representative in 2004 and was subsequently elected to the Senedd on their ticket in 2007.  Asghar was still an MS at the time of his death last year, although he had defected to the Conservatives in 2011.  Victoria division is now safe for Labour, whose defending candidate is Farzina Hussain.  Christine Jenkins resigned over a year ago, and the Victoria by-election was originally due to take place in April 2020 as were a number of other by-elections listed in this section.

<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2017/bridgend17.png" />

The old county of Mid Glamorgan has given us three by-elections which have all generated varying degrees of controversy.  <b>Bridgend</b> councillor David Owen has got his name firmly into the Councillors Behaving Badly file after he was sentenced to three years' imprisonment in March 2020: he was found guilty of conspiracy to steal and handling stolen goods, in relation to the theft of an agricultural vehicle worth £9,000 from a farm in Abergavenny.  His resignation letter to the council was sent from his prison cell, shortly before he was due to be disqualified from office (this kicks in when the deadline for appeals expires, or once any appeal is disposed of).  Owen had served since 2012 as an independent councillor for <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i10851">Nant-y-moel</a> division, at the head of the Ogmore Valley, and had beaten Labour 62-38 in 2017.  The Nant-y-moel by-election features an all-female ballot paper: new independent Mary Hughes is challenged by Labour's Lee-Anne Hill and the Tories' Clare Lewis.

<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2017/rct17.png" />

In the large <b>Rhondda Cynon Taf</b> district, Conservative councillor Mike Diamond has fallen out with his former party and resigned as councillor for the Cardiff commuter area of <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i11204">Llantwit Fardre</a> division, which is the only safe Tory division in the district; while the council's only member from the Cynon Valley Party, Gavin Williams, has been controversially disqualified under the six-month non-attendance rule, leaving a vacancy in the village with Wales' highest rates of child poverty according to official 2019 figures, <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i11209">Penrhiwceiber</a>.  Labour still hold the other seat in Penrhiwceiber division.  Gavin Williams is seeking re-election in the by-election caused by his disqualification, this time as an independent candidate; Ross Williams will try to gain his seat for Labour.  The defending Conservative candidate in Llantwit Fardre is Sam Trask.

<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2017/neath17.png" />

Over in Port Talbot, Labour have the tricky task of defending the <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i11377">Aberavon</a> division of <b>Neath Port Talbot</b> under the shadow of the M4 motorway.  This is an electoral division of two parts, with the Aberavon and Baglan Moors areas divided from each other by the Neath Port Talbot Hospital and a large industrial estate.  Aberavon division was a stronghold of the continuing SDP into the twenty-first century, long after they had disappeared from the national scene; but the SDP are now extinct here and the division's three seats split two to Plaid Cymru and one to Labour in 2017.  Labour's Stephanie Lynch has the task of defending this by-election; Plaid's Andrew Dacey will look to gain.

<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2017/swansea17.png" />

Finally, Labour also have two by-elections to defend in the city of <b>Swansea</b>.  <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i11421">Castle</a> division (in the Swansea West constituency) covers the city centre, while <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i11435">Llansamlet</a> division (in the Swansea East constituency)  is in the north-east of the city and takes in the villages of Llansamlet and Birchgrove together with the Swansea Enterprise Park.  Both of these returned full slates of four Labour councillors in May 2017 and should be safe for the party's candidates: Hannah Lawson in Castle (which has a field of nine candidates) and Matthew Jones in Llansamlet.

<h2>Greater London</h2>

<h3>Mayor and Assembly</h3>

A quick mention of the biggest single election in the country.  The fifth <b>Mayor of London</b> election will grab a lot of the headlines; this was a Labour gain at the most recent poll in 2016 after Conservative mayor Boris Johnson stood down.  (Anybody know what happened to him after that?  Answers on a postcard to the usual address.)  The Labour candidate, then Tooting MP Sadiq Khan, led the Conservative candidate Zac Goldsmith by 44-35 in the first round, and increased that lead to 57-43 in the runoff:  1,310,143 votes to 994,614.

Khan is seeking a second term, and a number of opinion polls suggest he will not struggle to get it.  The Conservatives have selected Shaun Bailey, who has been a London Assembly member since 2016 and has stood twice for Parliament: he fought Hammersmith in 2010, and Lewisham West and Penge in 2017.  Also standing are (deep breath): Siân Berry for the Green Party, Luisa Porritt for the Liberal Democrats, Peter Gammons for UKIP, Mandu Reid for the Women's Equality Party, Kam Balayev for Renew (an anti-Brexit group), Count Binface (who needs no introduction) for his self-titled party, Valerie Brown for the Burning Pink party (an Extinction Rebellion splinter group), Piers Corbyn for Let London Live (an anti-lockdown group), independent Max Fosh (a YouTuber), Laurence Fox for the Reclaim Party (another anti-lockdown group), Richard Hewison for a group called Rejoin EU, Vanessa Hudson for the Animal Welfare Party, Steve Kelleher for the Social Democratic Party, outgoing Assembly member David Kurten (who was originally elected for UKIP) for the Heritage Party, independent Farah London (a businesswoman), independent Nims Obunge (pastor of an evangelical church and head of an anti-crime charity), independent Niko Omilana (another YouTuber), and Brian Rose of the London Real Party (another anti-lockdown group).

The <b>Greater London Assembly</b> is the only English elected body to use proportional representation.  In the 2016 election Labour polled 40% of the vote on the Londonwide list ballot and won 12 seats; the Conservatives polled 29% of the vote and won 9 seats; the Greens and UKIP polled 8% and 7% respectively and won 2 seats each; and the Liberal Democrats won 1 seat with 6%, just coming in over the 5% threshold which applies to the list vote.  13 seats would be an overall majority, and if Labour can improve their list vote that could be in range.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

There are forty-six local by-elections in the capital on 6th May, all of which are being dealt with by the London Elects team as part of the centralised Mayor and Assembly count.  This is being split over two days, with seven GLA constituencies due to declare on Friday 7th, and the other seven constituencies and the list votes to come in on Saturday 8th.  Accordingly, it may take some considerable time for these by-election results to come through after the poll.  It could be worse: Tower Hamlets could be running the show.

<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2018/redbridge18.png" />

I'll go through these polls in an anti-clockwise direction, starting with two by-elections to <b>Redbridge</b> council.  <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i19462">Seven Kings</a> ward has a name which has nothing to do with seven kings; it was originally something like "Sevekings", and as such probably referred to a settlement of people associated with a man called Seofoca.  This ward lies to the north of the Great Eastern railway line and Roman road, while <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i19458">Loxford</a> ward lies to the south of those communication links on the east bank of the River Roding.  Both of these wards were over 75% Labour in the 2018 local elections, so quite why Chaudhary Mohammed Iqbal, elected on the Labour slate in Loxford, thought it was necessary to commit electoral fraud to get elected there is difficult to fathom.  Iqbal, who was living in Barking at the time of the election, had lied about his address on his nomination papers; he resigned from the council after pleading guilty to four criminal charges, and is now serving a 68-week prison sentence.  The defending Labour candidates are Sahdia Warraich in Loxford and Pushpita Gupta in Seven Kings.

<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2018/barking-dagenham18.png" />

The River Roding flows into the Thames estuary at Barking Riverside, which forms the <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i14">Thames</a> ward of <b>Barking and Dagenham</b> council.  Barking and Dagenham has had a full slate of 51 Labour councillors since 2010, and don't expect any change to that here: in 2018 Thames ward gave 83% of the vote to Labour in a straight fight with the Conservatives.  This time there is more choice for the wards' voters with five parties and an independent candidate standing; although the Tories have put up a high-profile candidate in the form of Andrew Boff, who stood here in 2014 and has contested the Hackney mayoralty on a number of occasions, don't bet against Labour candidate Fatuma Nalule.

<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2018/newham18.png" />

Barking and Dagenham's Thames ward is served by Dagenham Dock railway station, from which change at Barking for an Underground train to <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i296">East Ham Central</a> ward in the London Borough of <b>Newham</b>; similar considerations apply here, with Farah Nazeer as the defending Labour candidate.  The poor voters of East Ham Central will have five ballot papers to juggle: three votes for the GLA, this by-election and the <b>Newham governance referendum</b> on whether to abolish the elected mayoralty and move to the committee system of governance.  This was not without controversy: a group looking to move back to the leader and cabinet model had put a petition in for a referendum to that effect, which was ruled out of order because it had been delivered during the middle of pandemic restrictions.  If the people of Newham decide to vote for a change in their governance, that would commence after the current Mayor Rokhsana Fiaz' term expires next year.

Another <b>governance referendum</b> has turned up in neighbouring <b>Tower Hamlets</b>, on scrapping the directly elected mayoralty (which, it's fair to say, has not proven an unqualified success here) and reverting to the Leader and Cabinet model of governance.  Any change would happen from 2022 when current mayor John Biggs comes to the end of his term.

<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2018/waltham-forest18.png" />

Rather different in character is the remaining by-election east of the Lea, in the <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i357">Hatch Lane</a> ward of <b>Waltham Forest</b>.  This is the south-eastern of the three wards covering Chingford, a Tory holdout which returns Iain Duncan Smith to Parliament.  Hatch Lane was safe enough for the Conservatives in May 2018, and their defending candidate is Justin Halabi.

<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2018/hackney18.png" />

Waltham Forest is part of the North East constituency of the London Assembly along with two Middlesex boroughs which have turned up with a large number of by-elections.  There are four polls in <b>Hackney</b>, with Labour defending the trendy <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i12960">Hoxton East and Shoreditch</a> ward on the edge of the City and also <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i12962">King's Park</a> ward in the Lea Valley (the ward which includes the Hackney Marshes), both within the Hackney South and Shoreditch constituency.  Both of the vacating councillors have gone on to greater things: Tom Rahilly (King's Park) now has a politically-restricted job, while Feryal Clark (Hoxton East and Shoreditch, elected under her maiden name of Feryal Demirci) was elected in December 2019 as the Labour MP for Enfield North.  The wards are safe, and the defending Labour candidates are Anya Sizer in Hoxton East and Shoreditch, and Lynne Troughton in King's Park.

In the Hackney North and Stoke Newington constituency, we have two fascinating by-elections in the Hasidic enclave of Stamford Hill.  At the time of the 2011 census, Hackney's New River and Lordship wards both turned in a Jewish population of over 25%, ranking 12th and 13th of all the wards in England and Wales for Judaism.  Since 2011 Hackney's ward boundaries have changed; much of this area is now covered by the <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i12970">Woodberry Down</a> ward (very safe Labour in 2018) and the <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i12967">Stamford Hill West</a> ward (a Conservative gain from Labour in 2018).  Both of these wards have by-elections on 6th May.  In Woodberry Down the defending Labour candidate is Sarah Young, while Stamford Hill West sees Conservative Hershy Lisser challenged by Labour's Rosemary Sales.

<b>Islington</b> borough has outdone Hackney with five by-elections.  <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i258">Bunhill</a> ward runs from the northern edge of the City to the Angel, and takes in the Silicon Roundabout at Old Street underground station; <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i271">St Peter's</a> ward runs north-east from the Angel between Essex Road and the Grand Union canal; <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i268">Mildmay</a> ward is centred on the Overground station at Canonbury; <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i264">Highbury West</a> ward includes Arsenal football grounds old and new; and <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i266">Holloway</a> ward is based on the northern end of the Caledonian Road.  The Bunhill by-election is to replace controversy magnet Claudia Webbe, who was elected in 2019 as a Labour MP for Leicester.  Despite the presence of independent candidates in Bunhill and St Peter's standing on anti-Low Traffic Neighbourhoods tickets, none of these polls should give the defending Labour candidates (respectively Valerie Bossman-Quarshie, Toby North, Angelo Weekes, Bashir Ibrahim and Jason Jackson) any cause for concern.

<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2018/enfield18.png" />

Things are different in <b>Enfield</b> district where Labour are defending three by-elections.  <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i103">Chase</a> ward, the northernmost ward within the Greater London boundary, takes in some genuinely rural areas within the M25 motorway; Crews Hill railway station, on the Hertford Loop, links the ward to the centre of the Great Wen.  This ward has swung a mile to the left over the last two decades, although not far enough for Labour to consider the ward safe yet.  Chris James defends for Labour, Andrew Thorp is the Conservative candidate.  Also within the Enfield North constituency is <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i115">Southbury</a> ward straddling the Great Cambridge Road, which is safer for Labour; as is <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i111">Jubilee</a> ward, immediately to the south of Southbury and located within the Edmonton constituency.  Ayten Guzel and Chinelo Anyanwu are respectively the defending candidates.

<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2018/barnet18.png" />

Also on the northern edge of Greater London is the <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i25">Edgware</a> ward of <b>Barnet</b>, where the Northern Line terminates; included within this ward is the Scratchwood or London Gateway motorway service area on the M1, assuming that the guns of HMS <em>Belfast</em> (which are aimed at Scratchwood) haven't destroyed it yet.  This is a safe Conservative ward with a very large Jewish population; the defending candidate is Nick Mearing-Smith.  Barnet by-election watchers are more likely to be focused on the poll in <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i23">East Barnet</a> ward, to the east of the East Coast main line and served by Oakleigh Park and New Barnet stations; this was narrowly gained by Labour in 2014, but the Tories took of the ward's three seats back in a close 2018 result.  Labour candidate Linda Lusingu is defending the East Barnet by-election, the Tories' Nicole Richer will try to gain.

<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2018/brent18.png" />

Another Labour-held marginal to watch is the <b>Brent</b> ward of <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i41">Brondesbury Park</a> in Willesden, which has returned slates from all three major parties in the last three local elections.  Labour gained this ward from the Conservatives in 2018 by the narrow margin of 45% to 43%.  Three by-election results in Brent in January 2020 were very poor for Labour, but things may have changed since then.  Gwen Grahl defends for Labour, Sapna Chadha will try to gain for the Conservatives.

<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2018/westminster18.png" />

Also keep an eye on the <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i372">Churchill</a> ward of <b>Westminster</b> city council.  Located at the southern end of Westminster either side of Grosvenor railway bridge, this ward includes the Victoria coach station and Chelsea Barracks but is based on Churchill Gardens, a highrise postwar housing estate on the far side of the river from Battersea Power station.  As with East Barnet, Churchill ward was Conservative up to 2010, voted Labour in 2014, and split its three seats two to Labour and one to the Conservatives in 2018.  If Labour can repeat their good December 2019 result in the local Cities of London and Westminster constituency, this by-election should be a comfortable hold for them.  Labour's Liza Begum is challenged by the Conservatives' Shaista Miah.

<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2018/ealing18.png" />

Moving into west London, we come to three by-elections in the <b>Ealing</b> borough.  Two of these are caused by Conservative councillors being elected to Westminster: Alex Stafford (of <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i81">Ealing Broadway</a> ward) is now the MP for Rother Valley in Yorkshire, Joy Morrissey (of the neighbouring <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i87">Hanger Hill</a> ward, running from North Ealing underground station to the notorious Hanger Lane gyratory) has taken on the task of representing Beaconsfield in the Commons.  Both of these should be safe Conservative holds for Julian Gallant and Fabio Conti respectively.  Labour should just as easily defend <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i88">Hobbayne</a> ward, which runs north from Hanwell station on the Great Western main line to Ruislip Road East; their candidate here is Louise Brett.

<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2018/hillingdon18.png" />

Further out we come to the <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i219">Charville</a> ward of <b>Hillingdon</b> borough, a perennial marginal in Hayes to the north of the Uxbridge Road.  Unusually for a London ward, Charville has swung to the right over the last two decades: it returned a full slate of Labour councillors in 2002 and a full Conservative slate in 2018, with split representation at the three elections in between.  Defending Tory candidate Darran Davies, who got himself into trouble during the campaign for some offensive stuff on his Facebook, is challenged by Labour's Steve Garelick.

<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2018/hounslow18.png" />

Mrs Gaskell's charming literary village of <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i241">Cranford</a> is located (checks notes) at the eastern end of the Heathrow Airport runways within the borough of <b>Hounslow</b>, and its economy is dependent on the airport - not good news at the moment.  Poonam Dhillon was one of the local residents who once drew a wage from services related to air travel (in her case, catering); in January 2021 she died from COVID-19, aged 58, during her third term as a councillor.  The by-election to replace her takes place at the same time as another by-election to Hounslow council, in the neighbouring <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i250">Hounslow Heath</a> ward.  Both of these are safe for Labour, whose candidates are Devina Ram and Madeeha Asim respectively.

<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2018/richmond-thames18.png" />

Our final by-election north of the river takes place in <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i554">Hampton Wick</a> ward, across the water from Kingston upon Thames.  This ward in the borough of <b>Richmond upon Thames</b> was safe Conservative up to 2014, when the councillors elected on the Tory slate here included Tony Arbour and Tania Mathias.  Arbour is a veteran of local government who was first elected to Richmond council as far back as 1968, won one of the last by-elections to the Greater London Council in 1983, and has represented the South West constituency of the London Assembly since the establishment of the Assembly in 2000.  (He retires from the Assembly this year.)  Mathias was elected in 2015 as the MP for the local Twickenham constituency, defeating cabinet minister Vince Cable; she promptly resigned from Richmond council, and the resulting by-election surprisingly went to the Liberal Democrats.  This was a harbinger of things to come: Richmond upon Thames was comprehensively taken over by the Liberal Democrats at the 2018 election.  A number of wards in that election saw joint slates of Lib Dem and Green Party candidates, and Hampton Wick was one of them; this by-election is one of them, and this by-election is caused by the resignation of Hampton Wick's Green councillor Dylan Baxendale.  He won the final seat in 2018 with a majority of 98 votes over Tony Arbour, a long way behind the Lib Dem slate.  This one looks interesting, particularly as the Lib Dems are standing a candidate.  Chas Warlow defends for the Greens, Petra Fleming challenges for the Lib Dems, Nina Watson stands for the Conservatives.

<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2018/kingston-thames18.png" />

If Richmond's by-election is interesting, the by-election in <b>Kingston upon Thames</b> looks bizarre.  This is in <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i478">Chessington South</a> ward, the salient of Greater London between Esher and Epsom.  Chessington South is safe Lib Dem, and the by-election has come about due to the resignation of their councillor Patricia Bamford who has topped the poll here in every election this century.  Her son Charles Bamford is contesting the by-election - for the Labour Party, while the former Labour MP for Thurrock Andrew Mackinlay (who was a Labour member of Kingston council many years ago) is also contesting the by-election - as the defending Liberal Democrat candidate.  This may be the constituency of the Lib Dem leader Ed Davey, but Chessington South ward also contains the pub run by the Official Monster Raving Loony Party's deputy leader Jason "Chinners" Chinnery, and Chinners has recruited not one, not two, but <em>thirteen</em> OMRLP candidates for this by-election, which deserves some sort of award (the Turner Prize would probably be the most appropriate one).  On the other hand, I suppose it's <em>possible</em> that all those Loonies might end up splitting the vote.  Overall the ballot paper has nineteen candidates, which must be a record for a single-member local by-election.

<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2018/merton18.png" />

Labour have a seat to defend in each of the boroughs of Merton and Wandsworth.  The <b>Merton</b> by-election is in Merton's half of the <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i543">St Helier</a> estate; this ward has had a few by-elections in previous years (<em>Andrew's Previews 2016</em>, page 81; <em>2017</em>, page 196) which have given Labour no trouble, and neither should this poll.  Helena Dollimore defends.

<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2018/wandsworth18.png" />

The <b>Wandsworth</b> seat is vacated by Fleur Anderson, who scored the only Labour gain from the Conservatives in December 2019 by winning the Putney constituency; her former <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i606">Bedford</a> ward is in the Tooting constituency, named after the Bedford Hill and including much of Tooting Common.  Anderson gained her council seat from the Conservatives in 2014 alongside Rosena Allin-Khan, who now represents Tooting in Parliament.  Bedford ward swung further to Labour in 2018 to return a full Labour slate for the first time, but the defending Labour candidate Hannah Stanislaus shouldn't forget that when it comes to local elections Normal Rules Do Not Apply within the borough of Wandsworth.

<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2018/croydon18.png" />

The troubled finances of the London Borough of <b>Croydon</b> will not be helped by having to organise five council by-elections this May.  Two of these are due to the resignations of the former Labour council leader Tony Newman and former finance cabinet member Simon Hall, on whose watch the borough ran out of money.  Newman and Hall, who are suspended from the Labour party, have respectively vacated <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i19820">Woodside</a> ward (south-east of Norwood Junction station) and <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i19801">New Addington North</a> (the northern half of the isolated quasi-New Town of New Addington).  Labour are also defending a by-election in <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i19816">South Norwood</a> ward (west of Norwood Junction station), while the Tories have seats to defend in <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i19806">Park Hill and Whitgift</a> ward (south-east of Croydon town centre) and <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i19800">Kenley</a> ward (on the road and railway lines towards Warlingham and Caterham on the southern edge of Greater London).  None of these should give the defending parties much cause for concern in ordinary course, although with the special circumstances that apply in Croydon at the moment there is the potential for some big swings.  The defending Tory candidates are Ola Kolade in Kenley and Jade Appleton in Park Hill and Whitgift, while the Labour candidates for New Addington North, South Norwood and Woodside are respectively Kola Agboola, Louis Carserides and Michael Bonello.  Independent candidate Mark Samuel, a regular fixture in Croydon local by-elections who sometimes achieves the dizzy heights of ten votes, put in nomination papers for all five by-elections but was only allowed to contest one: he has chosen Woodside ward.  Croydon council have recently received a petition for a mayoral referendum, which will be held over until the autumn.

<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2018/lewisham18.png" />

Greenwich and Lewisham have turned up with four by-elections each, all of them Labour defences.  In <b>Lewisham</b>, promising young Labour councillor Tom Copley is now a Deputy Mayor of London in Sadiq Khan's administration, while Joe Dromey (the son of Jack Dromey and Harriet Harman) has also taken up a new job which is politically restricted.  They have vacated <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i525">Sydenham</a> and <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i522">New Cross</a> wards respectively.  There also by-elections in the south of the borough in the <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i510">Bellingham</a> ward (for more on which see <em>Andrew's Previews 2016</em>, page 133) and the neighbouring ward of <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i513">Catford South</a>.  All of these were safe for Labour in 2018.  The defending Labour candidates are Rachel Onikosi in Bellingham, James Royston in Catford South, Samantha Latouche in New Cross and Jack Lavery in Sydenham.

<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2018/greenwich18.png" />

Turning our attention to <b>Greenwich</b>, a mention is due to the first Muslim to become a UK local council leader.  Mehboob Khan led the Labour group on Kirklees council in West Yorkshire from 2003 to 2014, and was leader of that council from 2009 to 2014.  In 2015 he resigned from Kirklees council and transferred to Greenwich, taking over the seat in <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i464">Greenwich West</a> ward vacated by the newly-elected Greenwich and Woolwich MP Matthew Pennycook.  Khan has now taken a politically-restricted job and accordingly a by-election needs to be held in Greenwich West.  This is the core of historic Greenwich, taking in the town centre, the Royal Naval College, Greenwich Park and the old Observatory building, whose position defines the Greenwich Meridian of 0 degrees longitude.

The by-election in Greenwich's <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i463">Glyndon</a> ward, covering the area between Plumstead and Woolwich, is less savoury.  Tonia Ashikodi, who won a by-election here in May 2016 and was re-elected on the Labour slate in 2018, had accepted a council house in the borough in 2012 without revealing that she was the owner of three other properties.  She was found guilty of two charges of fraud by false representation, and in March 2020 she resigned from the council after being given an 18-month suspended sentence.  A by-election was immediately called to replace her but the pandemic intervened before it could be held, and Ashikodi's dishonesty has meant her council has had a vacant seat for over a year.

The other two Greenwich by-elections are both Labour defences, in the wards of <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i465">Kidbrooke with Hornfair</a> and <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i469">Shooters Hill</a> along the Roman road towards the Channel ports.  On paper, none of these should give Labour any cause for concern.  The defending Labour candidates are Sandra Bauer in Glyndon, Pat Slattery in Greenwich West, Odette McGahey in Kidbrooke with Hornfair, and Clare Burke-McDonald in Shooters Hill.

<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2018/bexley18.png" />

The final two by-elections in London are both the result of councillors moving on to greater things.  Conservative councillor and London Assembly member Gareth Bacon was elected in 2019 as the MP for Orpington, and he has vacated his <b>Bexley</b> council seat in <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i19367">Longlands</a> ward (the western end of Sidcup).  Labour councillor Marina Ahmad is contesting and is favourite to win the Lambeth and Southwark constituency in this year's London Assembly elections, and she has resigned her <b>Bromley</b> council seat in <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i420">Crystal Palace</a> ward.  These should be safe defences for their respective parties' candidates: Lisa-Jane Moore for the Conservatives in Longlands, Ryan Thomson for Labour in Crystal Palace.

<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2018/bromley18.png" />

As stated, this is the first of four parts of my previews of the 6th May 2021 elections.  Keep an eye out for Part II, which will cover the North of England and the English Midlands.

<h2>Northumbria</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

Vera Baird, the former Labour MP for Redcar, was Northumbria PCC from 2012 until 2019 when she resigned to become Victims' Commissioner for England and Wales.  The resulting by-election, held in July 2019, saw Labour's Kim McGuinness, a Newcastle upon Tyne city councillor, take the lead on first preferences: 38%, against 22% each for two Northumberland councillors, independent candidate Georgina Hill and Conservative Robbie Moore; the Lib Dems coming in fourth and last with 19%.  Having placed second narrowly ahead of Moore, Hill got into the runoff and picked up most of the transfers, meaning that McGuinness was elected in the final reckoning by the narrow margin of 52-48.

McGuinness is seeking re-election.  Georgina Hill has not returned but there is a new independent candidate, NHS doctor Julian Kilburn.  The Tories have had to change candidate after Robbie Moore got elected to Parliament in December 2019 (more on that story later) and they have selected Duncan Crute.  Completing the ballot paper is Gateshead councillor Peter Maughan, standing for the Lib Dems.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

The whole of Northumberland county council is up for election along with one-third of the seats in the five Tyne and Wear boroughs and the elected mayoralty of North Tyneside.

<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2017/northumberland17.png" />

The Conservatives almost won an overall majority in <b>Northumberland</b> in May 2017.  Their 12 net gains, for a total of 33 seats, were mostly due to a collapse by the Lib Dems who lost all their seats in the Berwick upon Tweed constituency.  However, the Conservatives did also gain two seats in Cramlington (one of them from a Labour councillor called Laura Pidcock, who subsequently had an ill-starred Parliamentary career in North West Durham) and tied for first place in the South Blyth division whose Lib Dem councillor was re-elected on the returning officer's drawing of lots.  This was a sign of things to come: Cramlington and Blyth are both in the Blyth Valley constituency which was the first declared Conservative gain of the December 2019 general election.  With 33 seats against 24 for Labour, 7 independents and 3 Lib Dems the Conservatives formed a minority administration, although they're a man down at the moment after Robbie Moore went off to become for Keighley.  His seat in Alnwick is vacant, and this was crucial in 2020 when the then Conservative leader Peter Jackson lost a confidence vote over a whistleblowing scandal by 33 votes to 32.

<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/sunderland19.png" />

The largest of the five Tyne and Wear boroughs is another early declarer: the city of <b>Sunderland</b>.  This column wrote in 2019 that Sunderland has a Labour administration which is very locally unpopular while also having a very secure majority, and despite the fact that Labour lost 12 councillors in 2019 that's still true.  The Labour group currently has 51 seats (three of which are vacant), against 12 Conservatives, 8 Lib Dems, 3 UKIPpers and 1 Green (whose seat is vacant).  There are 10 wards with split representation and Labour are defending every single one of them; but for the party's majority to be in serious danger they'd have to do far worse even than in 2019..

<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/ntyneside19.png" />

<b>North Tyneside</b> is different to the other four Tyne and Wear boroughs in that it has an elected mayor.  The mayoralty has been held by both Labour and the Conservatives in the past with a number of very close results, but the last mayoral election in 2017 had a big lead for Labour's Norma Redfearn who was re-elected in the first round with a 56-31 lead over the Conservatives.

Redfearn is seeking re-election for a third term as Mayor.  The Conservatives have selected Steven Robinson, a Royal Marine turned British Gas engineer.  Also standing are John Appleby for the Lib Dems, Jack Thomson for UKIP and Penny Remfry for the Green Party.

Including vacancies, Labour hold 51 of the 60 seats on North Tyneside council 7 Conservatives, a Lib Dem and an independent.  A repeat of the 2019 results would result in no change to the Labour total, as they would pick up the Lib Dem seat in Northumberland ward to offset a net loss to the Conservatives.  In the event that the Conservatives gain the mayoralty, it's likely that the new mayor will have to cohabit with a Labour-majority council.

Labour are secure in the other three Tyne and Wear boroughs, although they may suffer a net loss of seats in <b>South Tyneside</b>, where there has been some infighting in the Labour group, and in <b>Newcastle upon Tyne</b> where the Lib Dems and localists did reasonably well in 2019.

<h2>Durham</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

Ron Hogg, who had led the English police response against football hooliganism during the 2002 FIFA World Cup in Japan and South Korea, had been the Durham PCC since 2012.  In 2016 he was re-elected in the first round, defeating the Conservatives 64-24.  Hogg died in December 2019 and his deputy, Steven White, has been serving as PCC in an acting capacity since then.

The Labour Party have selected Joy Allen as their new candidate for Durham PCC; she is the Mayor of Bishop Auckland and a cabinet member on Durham county council.  The Tories' George Jabbour, who claims to be the only candidate ever to run for election in all four nations of the UK, adds a PCC run to his previous attempts at elections to Parliament (in Inverclyde), the Senedd (in Bridgend), the Northern Ireland Assembly (in Belfast South) and three local authority mayoral elections (in Doncaster, Mansfield and Watford).  He's never been particularly close to winning on any of those occasions.  Anne-Marie Curry completes the ballot paper for the Lib Dems.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2017/durham17.png" />

There are whole council elections this year for <b>Durham</b> council.  The last elections here were in 2017 and left Labour with a reduced majority.  They won 74 seats against 25 for various categories of independents and localists, 14 for the Liberal Democrats (who are particularly strong in Durham city), 10 Conservatives and 3 seats for the North East Party, a regionalist movement with a powerbase in the New Town of Peterlee.  None of the ten Conservative councillors were elected in the North West Durham constituency, which the party now holds in Westminster.  There have been six by-elections since 2017, with Labour holding three, the Lib Dems holding one and gaining one from Labour, and a very fragmented by-election in Spennymoor in May 2019 which saw an independent candidate finish in first place with just 19% of the vote, succeeding a different independent.

There are no scheduled local elections this year in <b>Darlington</b>, but that borough will take part in the Tees Valley mayoral election, discussed in the Hartlepool section.  Darlington council does have two by-elections: Paul Howell, the new Conservative MP for Sedgefield, has vacated his seat in <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i17469">Hummersknott</a> ward on the western edge of town, while on the eastern edge of town Labour are defending the <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i17477">Red Hall and Lingfield</a> ward which Howell unsuccessfully contested in 2015.  Both of those wards were safe in 2019, although Red Hall and Lingfield was fairly close in a November 2017 by-election (<em>Andrew's Previews 2017</em>, page 343).

<h2>Cumbria</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

The Cumbria PCC position has been held by the Conservatives since 2012.  Peter McCall, a former Army officer who commanded a squadron during the Bosnian war, has served since 2016.  On the first count he had 34% of the vote against 24% for Labour, 17% for the Lib Dems and 15% for an independent candidate; in the runoff McCall defeated the Labour candidate by 58-42.

McCall is seeking a second term.  Labour have selected former Allerdale councillor Barbara Cannon.  The Liberal Democrat candidate is Loraine Birchall, chair of the party's Barrow and Furness branch.  The independent from last time has not returned, so those are your three candidates.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

When it comes to discussion of Cumbrian local elections, there's really only one place we can start.

<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/cursing-stone.jpg" />

This is your columnist's photograph of the Cursing Stone.  Located in a pedestrian subway just outside Carlisle Castle in the city centre, and installed in 2001, it's a polished granite boulder inscribed with a 1,069-word curse placed on border reivers in 1525 by Gavin Dunbar, then archbishop of Glasgow.  It has cursed <b>Carlisle</b>.

That's a strong statement to make, but consider: in the year the Stone was installed the farms of Cumberland were devastated by foot-and-mouth disease.  The city has suffered a series of devastating floods, in 2005 and the Storm Desmond flood of 2015, which took out the McVitie's factory and led to a national biscuit shortage which lasted for months.  The Cursing Stone has taken the blame for a series of well-publicised crimes, hits to the local economy and even Carlisle United's relegation from the football league in 2004.  Coincidence?

Consider also: after the 2005 flood Jim Tootle, city and county councillor for Castle ward which then covered the Cursing Stone, proposed to the city council that it be removed or destroyed to prevent any further nasty things happening.  The council voted to keep it.  Seven years later Tootle was dead at the age of 59, and since then a series of other councillors for Castle ward have died at an early age or resigned.  Since the Cursing Stone was installed, Carlisle's Castle ward has had a horrific councillor attrition rate, with nine by-elections here (either at city or county level) in the fifteen years from 2001 to 2016.  Coincidence?

Consider also: the scheduled elections this year for the whole of Cumbria county council and one-third of Carlisle and South Lakeland councils have been cancelled, pending a possible reorganisation of local government in the area.  As a result, only the PCC elections and a series of by-elections are taking place in the county on 6th May.  One of these is a by-election to Carlisle city council for the renamed and redrawn ward of Cathedral and - you guessed it - Castle.

<em>Coincidence?</em>

<a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i21165">Cathedral and Castle</a>, Carlisle's city-centre ward, is just one of three by-elections in Carlisle which Labour have the task of holding on 6th May.  These days it's a safe Labour ward, as is <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i21171">Newtown and Morton North</a> ward in the inner west of the city; Labour also have a full slate of councillors in <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i21169">Harraby South and Parklands</a> ward, along the London Road at the south-eastern entrance to the city, but the Conservatives and UKIP were both fairly close behind at the only previous poll on these lines in 2019.  UKIP haven't returned, but the Conservatives have selected Linda Mitchell in Harraby South and Parklands, while the defending Labour candidate there is Abdul Harid.  The Labour defences in the other two Carlisle city by-elections are led by Pete Sunter (Cathedral and Castle) and David Graham (Newtown and Morton North).

The Carlisle returning officer also has the task of organising a by-election to Cumbria county council in the <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i13692">Brampton</a> division.  This covers the town of Brampton, on the road and railway line from Carlisle to Newcastle, as well as six other parishes to the north-east of the town.  Brampton division was safe Conservative at the last county council elections in 2019, and their defending candidate is Mike Mitchelson.

The returning officer for <b>Allerdale</b> is even busier, with seven by-elections to arrange.  Two of these arise from the death of Joe Holliday, who was an independent member of both the district and the county councils.  His district council ward was <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i19544">St John's</a>, the eastern ward of Workington town; his county council seat of <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i13673">St John's and Great Clifton</a> added two villages to the east of Workington.  St John's returned two independents and a Labour councillor in 2019, while the county division was close between Holliday and Labour in 2017.  Independent district councillor Paul Scott is standing to replace Holliday in the county by-election, while the district by-election has two defending independent candidates (George Campbell and Andrew Eccles); the Labour candidate for both by-elections is Antony McGuckin, who was runner-up to Holliday in 2017.

Facing St John's ward across the River Derwent is the <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i19546">Seaton and Northside</a> ward of Allerdale council, which has been vacated by the new Workington MP Mark Jenkinson.  Jenkinson was first elected to the predecessor Seaton ward in 2015 as a UKIP candidate, the other two seats in Seaton going to his Kipper running-mate Joe Sandwith and Labour's Celia Tibble.  In the revised ward in 2019 Sandwith again topped the poll, this time as an independent candidate; a second independent was elected; and Jenkinson was re-elected to the final seat with a massive personal vote.  He polled 582 votes, enjoying a majority of 36 over the Labour slate, while his Tory running-mates only scored 117 and 97.  Can all that Conservative vote transfer to another candidate?  The Tories' Colin Sharpe will hope it can, while independent Aileen Brown and Labour's Beth Dixon will attempt to prove otherwise.

The Conservatives will fancy their chances of gaining two by-elections in the town of Cockermouth.  One is for the county council in <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i13664">Cockermouth North</a>, which was a Lib Dem gain from the Conservatives in 2017; Fiona Jayatilaka is the defending Lib Dem candidate here, while the Tories have selected Catherine Bell.  The Allerdale district ward boundaries divide Cockermouth east-west rather than north-south, with Labour defending a by-election in <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i19533">Christchurch</a>, the town's western ward; this was close between Labour and Conservative in 2019, and Labour's Helen Tucker has work to do to hold off the Tories' Alan Kennon.

Another chance of a Conservative pickup arises in the <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i19536">Ellen and Gilcrux</a> ward, covering three parishes along the River Ellen to the east of Maryport.  This ward elected the Labour slate in 2019, but one of the Labour councillors has been kicked off for non-attendance and the Tories are just about within marginal range.  Martin Harris is the defending Labour candidate, while Patrick Gorrill will try to gain for the Conservatives.  The neighbouring ward of <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i19530">Aspatria</a> (pronounced a-SPAY-tree-a, for those who weren't aware) was the only seat won in 2019 by the localist movement Putting Cumbria First; the localist councillor defected to the Conservatives before resigning, and with no new Putting Cumbria First candidate the Tories' Lucy Winter will attempt to convert their defection gain into a by-election gain.

There are enough by-elections here that they could make a significant difference to control of Allerdale council, which currently stands at 17 independent councillors, 15 Conservatives, 12 Labour and 5 vacancies.  An Independent-Conservative coalition was formed after the 2019 elections, but this has recently collapsed leaving the Conservatives in minority control.

In <b>Copeland</b> district, we finally get around to the by-election in <a href="https://tinyurl.com/qla4o9x">Whitehaven Central</a> ward which was postponed from March 2020.  For those who haven't been to Whitehaven, you should: despite the predations of John Paul Jones it's a rather handsome port full of nice Georgian buildings.  Whitehaven Central ward was created for the 2019 election, at which it split its three seats between two Labour candidates and an independent with the Conservatives not far behind.  Joseph Ghayouba defends for Labour, Richard Donnan stands as an independent candidate, and there may be some confusion generated by the Conservatives and the Heritage Party nominating two different candidates both called William Dixon.

We finish our tour of Cumberland as was by travelling to <b>Eden</b> district.  A few years ago Andrew's Previews visited the most White British ward in England and Wales, <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i5789">Hartside</a> ward on the western slopes of the High Pennines (<em>Andrew's Previews 2018</em>, page 47); on that occasion Robin Orchard succeeded his late wife Sheila as the ward's Conservative councillor.  Sheila Orchard, incidentally, had taken the seat over from John Lancaster, the father of the former England rugby head coach Stuart Lancaster.  I am sorry to report that councillor Robin Orchard has since passed away in his turn.  Orchard won the 2018 by-election easily and nobody opposed his re-election in 2019; for this by-election the defending Conservative candidate is Raymond Briggs (no, not that one).  There is also a poll in <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i5807">Skelton</a> ward, covering two far-flung parishes on the road from Penrith to Wigton and taking in the village of Unthank (<a href="https://youtu.be/6fL3E8FRxiw">no, not that one</a>), which is vacated by the former Conservative council leader Kevin Beaty.  Beaty had represented the ward since 2011 but only faced one contested election, defeating the Lib Dems easily in 2019; Colin Atkinson will try to hold his seat for the Conservatives.  The Conservatives lost control of Eden council in 2019, and a recent attempt by them to topple a rainbow anti-Conservative coalition failed.

Two by-elections take place to <b>Barrow-in-Furness</b> council.  <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i5725">Hindpool</a> ward, covering part of the town centre and points west, is a very safe Labour area where their candidate Jo Tyson should knock out the opposition.  The Conservatives' Jay Zaccarini should have few problems defending the village of <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i5730">Roosecote</a>, just to the east of the town.

The Conservative challenge to the Tim Farron political machine in <b>South Lakeland</b> may have been dented by the retirement from frontline politics of James Airey, who was leader of the Conservative group on the county council and had also previously led the Conservative group on Lancaster council.  Airey was the Conservatives' parliamentary candidate for Westmorland and Lonsdale in 2017 and 2019, losing narrowly to Farron on both occasions.  He has taken up a new position with the National Farmers' Union.

Accordingly we have by-elections for Airey's seats on Cumbria county council and South Lakeland council.  His county seat was <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i13743">Ulverston West</a>; the town of Ulverston is developing a bit of a counter-culture vibe, but Airey had a large majority in 2017 and Andrew Butcher, the Conservative candidate for the county by-election, will start as favourite.  Ulverston West has no overlap with Airey's district seat of <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i19846">Furness Peninsula</a>, which must be a strong candidate for the UK's most cthulhoid ward.  I mean, just look at it.

<img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EgqKvjuWoAAaswQ?format=png&name=900x900" />

<em>Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn.</em>  Thankfully Cthulhu is not qualified to be a councillor as the house at R'lyeh is outside the boundaries of South Lakeland district; as such the electors will be unable to vote for the greater evil on this occasion.  In the real world Furness Peninsula ward returned three Conservative councillors in 2018, the first contest on these boundaries, with the Lib Dems close behind; and the 2019 election saw the Lib Dems gain a seat.  So this is one to watch between the defending Conservative candidate Ben Cooper and the Lib Dems' Loraine Birchall, who is also standing in Ulverston West county by-election and for Police and Crime Commissioner.

There are three other by-elections to South Lakeland council on 6th May, two of which are difficult Conservative defences within the Lake District National Park.  <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i19843">Broughton and Coniston</a> ward split its three seats between two Conservatives and a Lib Dem in 2018 and was a Lib Dem gain in 2019.  The final Conservative seat is up in this by-election, with their candidate Matt Brereton (who lost his seat in 2019) up against the Lib Dems' Heather Troughton.  <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i19850">Kendal Rural</a> ward wraps around the north of the town to take in the Lune Gorge, which travellers on the motorway and railway line to Carlisle and Glasgow will traverse; the largest settlement here is Staveley-in-Kendal.  This ward returned two Lib Dems and a Conservative in 2018 with the Lib Dems holding one of their two seats in 2019; the Conservative seat is up in this by-election, and their candidate Luke Gudgeon will hope to defeat the Lib Dems' Ali Jama.

We finish our tour of Cumbria's by-elections on the county's south coast, in the Victorian seaside resort of Grange-over-Sands.  This forms the <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i19847">Grange</a> ward of South Lakeland council, which was close between the Lib Dems and Conservatives in 2018 but was safe Lib Dem in 2019.  Pete Endsor is their defending candidate.

<h2>Lancashire</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

The Lancashire police and crime commissioner is Labour's Clive Grunshaw.  In May 2016 he polled 44% in the first round against 32% for the Conservatives and 17% for UKIP, and went on to win the run-off by a 56-44 margin.

Grunshaw is seeking re-election for a third term.  The Conservatives have selected Lancashire county councillor Andrew Snowden.  UKIP's 2016 candidate James Barker stands again with the Reform UK nomination, and the ballot paper is completed by Neil Darby for the Liberal Democrats.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

There are elections this year for the whole of Lancashire county council, the whole of Chorley and Pendle councils on new ward boundaries, and one-third of Blackburn with Darwen, Burnley, Hyndburn, Preston, Rossendale and West Lancashire councils.

<b>Lancashire county council</b> has swung rather wildly in recent years: Labour in 2005, Conservative in 2009, hung in 2013 with Labour as the largest party, Conservative in 2017.  That election returned 46 Conservative councillors against 30 Labour, 4 Lib Dems, 2 independents, a Green councillor and the only UKIP councillor returned in 2017 (in Padiham ad Burnley West; he is now in the Conservative group).  The Tories had a majority of 8 seats which rests on particularly good results in marginal Rossendale and Colne and the New Town territory of Leyland.  There are a large number of marginal divisions in these areas, and on current polling this will be a difficult council for the Conservatives to defend.

The Conservatives did particularly well in East Lancashire at the 2019 general election, but generally this wasn't off a strong local government base.  Their strongest council is <b>Pendle</b> covering the towns of Nelson and Colne, but the Conservatives lost control here in May 2019 to a Labour/Lib Dem coalition.  There are new ward boundaries in Pendle this year with all the seats up for election; at the time of writing the Conservatives hold 22 seats (two of which are vacant), Labour 16 (one of which is vacant), the Lib Dems have 9 (one of which is vacant) and there is one independent.  One of the Tory vacancies is in respect of the new Bury South MP Christian Wakeford, who was the group leader here before he entered the Commons; Wakeford was subsequently thrown off Pendle council under the six-month non-attendance rule, which doesn't say much for his organisational skills.

Further down the Calder valley we come to <b>Burrnley</b>, which elected MPs from all three main parties in the last decade but whose council elections tell a rather different story.  Labour lost their majority on Burrnley council in May 2019, and the council currently stands at 22 Labour seats against 8 Lib Dems, 6 members of the Burnley and Padiham Independent Party, 6 Tories (three of whom were elected for UKIP, whose council group have effectively performed a reverse takeover of the Burnley Conservatives), 2 Greens and an independent.  A rainbow anti-Labour coalition was formed after the 2019 election, but this fell apart in September 2020 and Labour are back in minority control.  If the 2019 results are repeated, Labour would lose Trinity ward to the Greens and Rosegrove with Lowerhouse to the localists.

<b>Hyndburn</b> district (based on Accrington) has a Tory MP now but a large Labour majority on its council, which currently stands at 26 Labour seats (one of which is vacant) and 8 Conservative seats (two of which are vacant).  The vacant seats are in the politically split wards of Barnfield (in eastern Accrington), Overton (in Great Harwood) and St Andrew's (in Oswaldtwistle).  A repeat of the 2019 results would result in two seats swapping to give no net change here.

By contrast Labour have a difficult defence of <b>Rossendale</b> council over the moors in the upper Irwell valley.  They currently hold 19 out of 36 councillors, against 13 Tories and 4 independents and localists.  This time Labour are defending two wards (plus one held by a councillor who was expelled from Labour and isn't standing again) which voted Conservative in 2019 together with Eden ward, a normally-Tory area which surprisingly went Labour in 2016 in the aftermath of severe flooding in Irwell Vale on Boxing Day 2015.  This is one to watch.

South-facing Rossendale is paired for parliamentary purposes with north-facing Darwen, which is part of the borough of <b>Blackburn with Darwen</b>.  This is strongly Labour (34 out of 51 seats at present) and if the 2019 results are repeated Labour would gain one seat from the Conservatives.

Perhaps surprisingly Labour have an even larger majority on <b>Chorley</b> council (37 out of 47 seats), having gained five seats here from the Conservatives in 2019.  There are new ward boundaries in Chorley this year with all the seats on the council up for election, which may give the Tories some chance of fighting back although they start a long way behind.

New ward boundaries came in last year for <b>Preston</b>, resulting in a Labour majority with 30 seats against 9 each for the Tories and Lib Dems.  Only one ward could be reasonably described as marginal on the basis of the 2019 results (Tory-held Sharoe Green ward in Fulwood) so we shouldn't expect much if any change here.

<b>West Lancashire</b> elections are normally a snoozefest, this being an extremely polarised district where two-party swings are low; however, this year promises to be interesting.  Currently Labour have 29 seats, the Conservatives have 19 and there are 6 councillors from the OWL group.  The OWLs are not what they seem: the initials represent Our West Lancashire, a localist group which won all three wards in Ormskirk in the 2019 election.  This time round Labour are defending two of the Ormskirk wards, and if they lose them both it will probably be No Overall Control time.

There are nine other local by-elections to report.  In the politically-balanced <b>South Ribble</b> council Labour defend the <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i17387">St Ambrose</a> ward in central Leyland, while the Conservatives defend the <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i17382">Longton and Hutton West</a> ward off the Preston-Liverpool road; these are safe wards and should return Labour's Kath Unsworth and the Tories' Julie Buttery respectively.

Further up the Ribble Valley we come to three Tory-held wards in the <b>Ribble Valley</b> local government district.  Mellor ward covers three parishes immediately to the north-west of Blackburn; Billington and Langho ward is the northern terminus of the Devil's Highway, the A666 from Blackburn; West Bradford and Grindleton covers two villages north of Clitheroe which were once part of Yorkshire.  All of these are very safe Conservative wards.  The defending Tory candidates are Steve Farmer in Billington and Langho, Robin Walsh in Mellor and Kevin Horkin in West Bradford and Grindleton.  For previous results in all three wards see <a href="https://tinyurl.com/yxgu6pvc">here (link)</a>.

<b>Blackpool</b> council has recently lost two veteran councillors.  Lily Henderson may have been the oldest serving local councillor in the UK when she died in January at the age of 94; she had first been elected to Blackpool council in 1983 as a Conservative, and since 2000 she had represented <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i1923">Highfield</a> ward in the south of the town.  Her death leaves a tricky by-election in a marginal ward which has split its two seats between Labour and the Conservatives since 2011.  Bradley Mitchell defends for the Conservatives, Christine Wright is the Labour candidate.

At the other end of Blackpool it is my sorry duty to have to take you to Norbreck.  At the time of writing the Norbreck Castle Hotel was rated by Tripadvisor as 75th out of 81 hotels in Blackpool, and having had the dubious pleasure of staying there on several occasions (free of charge, thank goodness) I am not going to disagree with that assessment except to say that the Britannia group were lucky to find six worse hotels in the resort.  This dilapidated building on the seafront, a tram ride away from anywhere better, dominates the northern end of Blackpool like a set of bad teeth.

The <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i1927">Norbreck</a> ward which shares that hotel's name was represented throughout this century by Maxine and Peter Callow, who were originally Conservatives.  Peter Callow was the leader of Blackpool council from 2007 to 2011, overseeing a huge investment programme which saw the council buy the Blackpool Tower and the Winter Gardens, and upgrade the trams with modern vehicles.  The Callows were deselected by the Blackpool Conservatives for the 2019 election, but were easily re-elected as independent candidates.  Peter Callow died in November at the age of 81, another victim of COVID-19.  The by-election to replace him is contested by new independent candidate Pam Haslam, a recent jackpot winner on the People's Postcode Lottery, while Julie Sloman will seek to recover the ward for the Conservatives.

Finally, there are two by-elections to <b>Lancaster</b> council.  One of these is for <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i16649">Bulk</a> ward, the north-eastern ward of the city itself along the road towards Caton.  This is one of the few safe wards for the Green Party, who are strong in Lancaster, and their defending candidate is Jack Lenox.  Outside the urban area we come to <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i16659">Kellet</a> ward, covering five rural parishes east of Carnforth; this was safely Conservative in 2015 but the Lib Dems came from nowhere to win in 2019 with a majority of six votes.  Ross Hunter is the new Lib Dem candidate, Stuart Morris will look to recover the seat for the Conservatives.

<h2>Merseyside</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

The Merseyside PCC position is held by Labour's Jane Kennedy.  In 2016 she won in the first round with 62% of the vote, the Conservatives being her nearest challengers on 18%.

Kennedy has retired this year.  Labour have selected Liverpool councillor Emily Spurrell.  The Conservative candidate is Bob Teesdale, who is from Southport.  Also standing are Kristofor Brown for the Lib Dems and Malcolm Webster for Reform UK.

<h3>Liverpool City Region mayoral election</h3>

The Liverpool City Region mayoralty covers a larger area than just Merseyside, with the Halton borough also included; this covers the towns of Runcorn and Widnes up the Mersey estuary.  The first mayoral election was held in May 2017 and was a convincing win for the outgoing Liverpool Walton MP Steve Rotheram, who defeated Tory candidate Tony Caldeira in the first round by 59% to 20%.

Rotheram is seeking re-election.  The Conservatives have changed candidate to Jade Marsden, who was their parliamentary candidate for Bootle in 2015 and Sefton Central in 2017.  Also standing are David Newman for the Lib Dems and Gary Cargill for the Green Party.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

There are elections this year for one-third of all the Merseyside boroughs plus the elected mayoralty of Liverpool.

The <b>Liverpool</b> mayoralty (not to be confused with the Liverpool City Region mayoralty, or the Lord Mayor of Liverpool) is likely to be the main point of interest in the big city.  Labour's Joe Anderson performed poorly in 2016 relative to PCC Jane Kennedy; Big Joe won in the first round with 53% compared to 20% for the Liberal Democrats and 11% for the Green Party.  Recent legal troubles have forced him out of office.  A controversial Labour selection produced Joanne Anderson; no relation of Big Joe, Joanne has appeared in this column before (<em>Andrew's Previews 2019</em>, page 321) when she won a by-election to the city council in Princes Park ward.  She is not seeking re-election to the council this year, so the stakes are high for her.  The Liberal Democrats have reselected their council group leader Richard Kemp, and the Green candidate is also their council group leader, Tom Crone.  Completing the city mayoral ballot paper are Roger Bannister for the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition, Katie Burgess for the Conservatives, Steve Radford for the Liberal Party and independent candidate Stephen Yip.

Regardless of the mayoral result, the Commissioners sent into Liverpool by central government will continue to work with a Labour-majority city council.  Labour currently hold 73 out of 91 seats; a repeat of the 2019 results would see them lose one seat nett to the Greens.

Labour control of <b>Knowsley</b> is also secure, despite a poor performance in the 2019 election - a repeat of that would see the Green Party gain two seats and an independent gain one.  A similar story played out in <b>St Helens</b> in 2019, where the Greens won two wards from nowhere and were close in a number of others; a repeat of those results would see Labour lose four seats.

By contrast Labour are on the rise in <b>Sefton</b>, having finally broken through into the traditional Lib Dem stronghold of Southport.  They have a good chance of four seat gains this year (two from the Lib Dems in Southport, two from independents in Maghull) to increase the Labour majority.  Currently Labour hold 43 out of 66 seats here, which is a mark of how far this area has swung to the left: Sefton had never had a Labour majority before 2012.

The Labour majority over the water in <b>Wirral</b> council has disappeared since the 2019 election partially as a result of infighting following a left-wing takeover.  There are three wards with split representation, and this year Labour are defending all of them: Birkenhead/Tranmere and Prenton voted Green in 2019, whereas Pensby and Thingwall voted Conservative.

<h2>Cheshire</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

David Keane gained the Cheshire PCC post for Labour from the Conservatives in 2016.  On first preferences he had 40% of the vote to 38% for the Tories and 12% for UKIP; in the run-off Cheshire went Labour by the narrow margin of 51% to 49%, a majority of 2,949 votes.

This election will be a rematch between Labour's David Keane and the Conservative PCC he beat in 2016, John Dwyer.  With UKIP not standing again, the other candidates are Jo Conchie for the Lib Dems and Nick Goulding for Reform UK.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

Following the 2019 local elections Labour, for the first time, have a monopoly on local government in Cheshire, running as a majority or as a minority all the local government districts which cover the county.  And this is true whatever current or historical definition of Cheshire you use.  Rather striking for the county that includes the richest areas of north-west England.

There are elections this year for all the councillors in <b>Halton</b> and <b>Warrington</b>, with new ward boundaries coming in for Halton.  Both of these councils have strong Labour majorities at present (51 out of 56 seats in Halton, 45 out of 58 seats in Warrington).  The Conservatives gained the Warrington South parliamentary seat in December 2019 but that wasn't based on local government strength: in 2016 the party won just two seats on Warrington council, in the Real Housewives territory of Lymm South, and one of those has since gone Lib Dem in a by-election.

There are no local elections of any sort this year in Cheshire East or in Cheshire West and Chester apart from three by-elections.  In <b>Cheshire West and Chester</b> Labour currently have half of the seats, and that shouldn't change even with a by-election to defend in the town of <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i20363">Neston</a> at the foot of the Wirral; Neston was safely Labour in 2019 and their candidate Keith Millar should be favoured to hold.  The opposition Conservatives should also have little trouble defending a by-election in <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i20352">Frodsham</a>, after their councillor Andrew Dawson left these shores to take up a job with the Falkland Islands government; Christopher Basey can be expected to defend that poll.  In <b>Cheshire East</b> the ruling Labour group should have little trouble holding a by-election in <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i10940">Crewe West</a> ward, where their candidate is Connor Naismith.

<h2>Greater Manchester</h2>

<h3>Mayor of Greater Manchester</h3>

The Greater Manchester mayoralty was created in 2017, subsuming the Police and Crime Commissioner post.  Andy Burnham had a big win in the inaugural GM mayoral election, crushing the Tory candidate Sean Anstee by 63% to 23% in the first round.  Unusually, a ward-level breakdown of the count was published, and the number of wards Anstee carried in the county (out of a possible 214) can be counted on the fingers of two hands.

Burnham is seeking re-election to (among other things) complete his bus franchising policy, and little which has happened since 2017 suggests that he will struggle to achieve re-election.  The Tories have selected Laura Evans, a former Trafford councillor.  Also standing are Simon Lepori for the Lib Dems, Melanie Horrocks for the Green Party, Stephen Morris for the English Democrats, independent candidates Marcus Farmer, Alec Marvel and David Sutcliffe, and Nick Buckley for Reform UK.

The Returning Officer has sent a booklet to all households with candidate statements, and if you haven't received the booklet you can read it here (<a href="https://www.gmelects.org.uk/media/1071/r0688_1-gm-candidates-booklet-2021-acc.pdf">link</a>).  And if you have...

<h3>Local elections</h3>

There are elections this year for the whole of Goldfish - sorry, Salford council on new ward boundaries, the Mayor of Salford, and one-third of the councillors in the other nine Greater Manchester boroughs.

The only Conservative-run metropolitan borough in the North of England is the Greatest Town in the Known Universe.  Following a decisive rejection of Labour in the 2019 <b>Bolton</b> council election a minority Conservative administration was installed by a gaggle of localist groups, the Lib Dems and UKIP.  After a confusing series of defections, the composition of Bolton council is now 18 Labour, 17 Conservatives (1 elected as LD, 1 elected as UKIP), 6 Lib Dems (1 elected as Labour), 4 Farnworth and Kearsley First, 3 for the Bolton Independent Group (all elected as Conservative), 2 Horwich and Blackrod First Independents, 2 UKIP, 1 "One Kearsley" councillor (who was elected for Farnworth and Kearsley First), 4 ex-Labour independents (including all three councillors for Crompton ward), 1 ex-Conservative independent, and 2 vacancies following the deaths of Conservative councillors Christine and Paul Wild.  Christine was due for re-election this year in Westhoughton North and Chew Moor ward, while there will be a by-election in Astley Bridge ward to replace Paul.  We finally see the back of the infamous former Labour council leader Cliff Morris, who is standing down in Halliwell ward.

Students of Bolton politics have been greatly helped over the last year by the Twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/boltonelects">Bolton Elects</a>, run by a group of students who have bravely commissioned monthly polling of the Greatest Town.  Their March 2021 poll (the most recent available at the time of writing) had topline figures of 35% for Labour, 23% for the Conservatives, 15% for the Lib Dems and 20% for localist and other parties, which is a 4-point swing towards Labour since the 2019 elections.

Of the 12 wards Labour won in 2016, Farnworth and Hulton wards have already gone to the localists and the Conservatives in by-elections, while Breightmet and Crompton wards have been lost to defection.  Of those, only Crompton is likely to come back and that will probably be offset by further losses in Westhoughton South (to the Lib Dems) and the two Horwich wards (to Horwich and Blackrod First).  Even with the Lib Dems having withdrawn support for the minority Conservative administration, it should continue after these elections.  The localists are continuing to multiply: a "Bolton for Change" slate (containing a number of ex-UKIP figures) is standing in a number of wards, and there are now two competing localist parties in Keawyed City (namely Active for Westhoughton and the Westhoughton First Independents).  Of the two UKIP councillors who won in 2016, Mark Cunningham in Kearsley is seeking re-election as a Conservative (although he'll probably lose to Farnworth and Kearsley First), while Rees Gibbon in Little Lever and Darcy Lever is seeking re-election in what's clearly going to be a close election, judging from the deluge of leaflets coming through this column's letterbox.  One other thing: the Bolton Elects team have published ward subsamples, which with a sample size of around 100 aren't much better than noise but are consistently showing the Green Party in a position to win Hulton ward, the centre of a championship golf course planning controversy.  Watch this space.

The localist surge we have seen in Bolton could also spill over and cost Labour control of neighbouring <b>Bury</b> this year.  This is a council to watch, as Bury is a small but perfectly formed metropolitan district.  You can find everything here from Red Wall territory (Radcliffe) to trendy suburbs (Prestwich) to thriving towns (Bury) to well-off commuter areas (Tottington, Ramsbottom) to deprived estates (Dickie Bird).  All human life is here.

Bury currently has 27 Labour councillors plus one vacancy, 14 Conservatives plus one vacancy, 4 Lib Dems, 1 independent elected as a Conservative and 3 independents elected on a localism ticket in the forgotten town of Radcliffe, giving a Labour majority of 3.  In 2019 Labour lost Radcliffe North ward to the Conservatives, Radcliffe East ward to the localists and St Mary's ward in Prestwich to the Lib Dems; the localists subsequently took a by-election off Labour in working-class Radcliffe West.  Labour are defending all those wards this year.  There are several other marginal Labour wards which the Tories will have their eyes on, such as Elton and Unsworth in western and southern Bury; and of course this is a borough with two extremely marginal Conservative parliamentary seats.  The Bury Conservatives have made the headlines with their nomination of Jihyun Park, the first North Korean defector to stand for election in the UK, in the Moorside ward of northern Bury; there are two seats up for election there this year following the resignation of a Labour councillor, but the Conservatives haven't won Moorside since 2006 and a gain this time would be a tall order.

On the positive side for Labour, they have a good chance of offsetting any losses in the previous paragraph by gaining marginal Conservative seats in Ramsbottom and Prestwich's Sedgley ward.  Sedgley ward is 34% Jewish, the sixth-largest Jewish population for any ward in England and Wales, and was gained by the Conservatives in 2016; this was seen as a shock result at the time, and subsequent comfortable Labour holds in 2018 and 2019 suggest it might have been a fluke.  The Tory defence here will be not be helped by the fact that their new candidate has put out a leaflet which managed to misspell "Prestwich" in three different ways.  A Labour gain of Sedgley ward will likely be spun as an indication that the party is sorting out its anti-Semitism problem, but remember the 2018 and 2019 results before you accept that line.

The other major battle in Greater Manchester would appear to be for <b>Stockport</b> council.  This is currently tied at 26 seats each for Labour and the Lib Dems, with 8 Conservatives and three Heald Green ratepayers holding the balance of power.  In 2019 the Lib Dems gained five seats from the Conservatives and they have a chance of a further gain this year in Marple South and High Lane ward; that would probably make them the largest party on the council and could result in a change of control.

The other seven Greater Manchester boroughs have impregnable Labour majorities, and that includes <b>Salford</b> where all 60 councillors are up for re-election on new ward boundaries this year.  The new lines have created a completely new ward in the inner city, reflecting large housing developments under construction in the Quays area; the new Quays ward is hugely undersized at the moment in population terms but this should resolve itself over the next few years.

Salford has an elected mayor of its own, currently Labour's Paul Dennett who won the 2016 mayoral election in the first round: he polled 51% against 26% for the Conservatives and 16% for UKIP.  Dennett is standing for a second term.  The Conservative candidate is Arnie Saunders, who has appeared in this column before: a rabbi from Broughton Park, he was the Tory candidate who won the Kersal by-election in 2017 (<em>Andrew's Previews 2017</em>, page 66), and has subsequently turned Kersal - the number 1 Jewish ward in England and Wales - into a Conservative stronghold.  Saunders was the Conservative parliamentary candidate for Worsley and Eccles South in 2019.  UKIP haven't returned, so completing the Salford mayoral ballot paper are Wendy Olsen for the Green Party, independent candidates Stuart Cremins and Stephen Ord, and Jake Overend for the Lib Dems.

<h2>West Yorkshire</h2>

<h3>Mayor of West Yorkshire</h3>

The latest piece in the devolution jigsaw will slot into place in these elections with the first poll for the West Yorkshire mayoralty.  This position covers the five metropolitan boroughs of Bradford, Calderdale, Kirklees, Leeds and Wakefield, and will replace the West Yorkshire police and crime commissionership.

The outgoing PCC is Labour's Mark Burns-Williamson, who has overseen the county's police force almost continuously since 2003 when became chairman of the former West Yorkshire police authority.  In the 2016 election he came very close to winning in the first round, polling just under 50% against 23% for the Conservatives and 14% for UKIP, and increased his lead to 66-34 in the runoff.

Burns-Williamson is not standing again.  For the new mayoralty Labour have selected Tracey Brabin, a former <em>Coronation Street</em> actress who has been MP for Batley and Spen since winning the 2016 by-election after Jo Cox' murder.  The Conservative candidate is Matt Robinson, a Leeds city councillor.  There's no UKIP candidate this time, so completing the ballot paper are Stewart Golton for the Lib Dems, Thérèse Hirst for the English Democrats, Waj Ali for Reform UK, Bob Buxton for the Yorkshire Party and Andrew Cooper for the Green Party.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

There are elections this year for one-third of the councillors in all five West Yorkshire boroughs.  All of these had Labour majorities following the party's gain of <b>Calderdale</b> in May 2019; that council's Labour group (currently 28 councillors out of 51) has the chance to substantially increase its majority this year, as the Conservatives are defending 6 wards which voted for Labour, Lib Dem or an independent candidate in 2019.

The Labour majority in <b>Kirklees</b> district, however, disappeared in November 2020 after three councillors walked out of the party and went independent.  The party also faces a relatively difficult ward map - a repeat of the 2019 results would see Labour make a net loss of one seat.  Two of the Conservative gains in West Yorkshire at the December 2019 election are within Kirklees district - Colne Valley and Dewsbury - but the party has some catching up to do at the local level.

The other three West Yorkshire boroughs have comfortable Labour majorities, particularly so in <b>Wakefield</b> where the party holds three-quarters of the seats.  The Conservatives made no impression at all here in May 2019 - they held the four seats they were defending but fell short in their target ward of Wrenthorpe and weren't particularly close anywhere else.  Despite this, the party broke through to gain the Wakefield parliamentary constituency in December 2019.  The council's ward map is better for the Conservatives this year, as they will have the chance to gain the two Ossett wards which Labour are now defending.  Regrettably, Wakefield has an entry for the Councillors Behaving Badly file: Alex Kear, elected two years ago as an independent councillor for Airedale and Ferry Fryston ward, is now serving a four-year prison sentence for paedophile offences, and there will be a replacement for him elected at this election.

<h2>North Yorkshire</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

The North Yorkshire PCC position is Conservative-held.  The incumbent is Julia Mulligan, who in the 2016 election polled 40% against 26% for Labour and 23% for an independent candidate, beating Labour 59-41 in the runoff.

Mulligan is not standing again and the Conservatives have selected Philip Allott, a former leader of the Conservative group on Harrogate council and their parliamentary candidate for Halifax in 2015.  Away from politics he runs a PR agency.  The Labour candidate is Alison Hume, an award-winning TV screenwriter who was on the Labour list for Yorkshire and the Humber in the 2019 European Parliament elections.  Also standing are independent candidate Keith Tordoff and the Lib Dems' James Barker.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

The scheduled elections this year for the whole of North Yorkshire county council and one-third of Craven council have been postponed to 2022, to allow time for a consultation on local government reorganisation.  As a result, only by-elections are taking place to the county's local councils.  Two of these are for the <b>county council</b>.  The Liberal Democrats defend their seat in the two-member county division of <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i8345">Harrogate Bilton and Nidd Gorge</a>, covering the northern end of Harrogate town; the other seat in this division was Lib Dem in 2005 and 2009, UKIP in 2013 and Conservative in 2017, so we can expect an interesting contest here.  Andrew Kempston-Parkes is the defending Liberal Democrat candidate, Matt Scott will seek to gain for the Conservatives.

In the Yorkshire Dales National Park the Conservatives defend two by-elections in beautiful Ribblesdale, following the death of Richard Welch who sat on both the county council and <b>Craven</b> council.  His county seat of <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i8328">Ribblesdale</a> runs from the source of the Ribble all the way to the Lancashire border, with the town of Settle as the major population centre.  Craven's <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i8162">Penyghent</a> ward covers Ribblesdale from Stainforth northwards, together with the village of Giggleswick on the main road from Skipton to Kendal.  Welch had large majorities in both wards, and the succeeding Tory candidates David Staveley (for the county seat) and Robert Ogden (for the district seat) will be favoured.

Staying in the Yorkshire Dales National Park, there is a second by-election to Craven council for the <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i8153">Barden Fell</a> ward.  This is based on Wharfedale around the village of Bolton Abbey, taking in the ruined Bolton Abbey, and also extends west to cover the quarrying village of Rylstone.  Barden Fell had been a Conservative-held ward until 2016, when it was gained by independent candidate David Pighills.  Pighills was subsequently thrown off the council under the six-month non-attendance rule, but he is seeking re-election in the by-election caused by his own disqualification.  That by-election is a straight fight with the Tories' John Dawson.

Our final North Yorkshire by-election couldn't be in a more different landscape.  The <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i17284">Camblesforth and Carlton</a> ward of <b>Selby</b> district takes in nine parishes on the flat agricultural land between the Aire and the Ouse before their confluence just north of Goole.  The landscape here is dominated by the massive Drax power station, which supplies 6 per cent of Britain's electricity; Drax was once the third-largest coal-fired power station in Europe, but its conversion to biomass fuel is well under way.  Camblesforth and Carlton ward voted Conservative in 2015, but one of its councillors, Mike Jordan, subsequently defected to the Yorkshire Party and was re-elected in 2019 under the colours of the White Rose.  Jordan is now back in the Tory fold, and following the resignation of his running-mate Paul Welburn the Yorkshire Party have not put up a candidate to defend this by-election.  Camblesforth and Carlton can be expected to revert to the Conservatives, whose candidate is Charles Richardson.

<h2>Humberside</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

Labour gained the Humberside PCC position at the 2016 election, defeating Tory incumbent Matthew Grove 60-40 in the runoff; the first round had given 40% to Labour, 27% to the Conservatives and 18% to UKIP.  Grove had won narrowly in 2012, defeating the UKIP MEP Godfrey Bloom and former Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott.

The Labour incumbent PCC is former police chief superintendent Keith Hunter, who is seeking re-election.  The Conservatives had to change candidate at the last minute after Craig Ulliott, who was originally selected over a year ago, stood down just nine days before the nominations deadline; Hunter has since passed a file to Humberside Police with electoral fraud allegations against Ulliott.  Jonathan Evison, the present Mayor of North Lincolnshire, is picking up the pieces of the Conservative campaign.  With no UKIP candidate this time Bob Morgan, of the Liberal Democrats, completes the ballot paper.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

Two of the four Humberside boroughs are holding elections this year.  <b>North East Lincolnshire</b>, based on Grimsby, Cleethorpes and surrounding villages, has swung a mile to the right in recent years at both parliamentary and council level; the Tories won an overall majority here in 2019, and a repeat of those results would see them gain four more seats.

Things are rather different over the Humber estuary in the big city of <b>Kingston upon Hull</b>.  This has a rather narrow Labour majority of 31/57 seats, with a significant Liberal Democrat opposition of 24.  The city got new ward boundaries in 2018, and a repeat of the 2019 results would result in no net changes.

There are no local elections this year in North Lincolnshire or in the East Riding except for by-elections.  The amazing story of the <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i3013">Broughton and Appleby</a> ward of <b>North Lincolnshire</b> is too long to tell here, but I have related it before in an extraordinary edition of Andrew's Previews in April 2020 (<a href="https://www.britainelects.com/2020/04/26/tales-of-tight-contests-among-other-things/">link</a>), because I researched for it for a March 2020 double by-election that never happened.  We are now having another go at filling the seats vacated by the late Ivan Glover and the new Scunthorpe MP Holly Mumby-Croft; Janet Lee and Carol Ross will defend this ward which is now safely Conservative.  Also postponed from March 2020 is a by-election in the <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i3006">Ashby</a> ward of eastern Scunthorpe, which is safe for the defending Labour candidate Christopher Skinner.  Regrettably, the pandemic has added a fourth by-election to the list in North Lincolnshire: Derek Longcake, Conservative councillor for the <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i3011">Bottesford</a> ward of southern Scunthorpe, died in the first wave of COVID-19.  His widow Janet Longcake is the Conservative candidate for the resulting by-election, and she will start as favourite.

COVID-19 has also taken from us Mike Bryan, a Conservative member of the <b>East Riding</b> council.  His ward was <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i2963">South West Holderness</a>, based on the town of Hedon just east of Hull; this ward returned Lib Dem councillors until 2007 and an independent until 2011, but is now safe Conservative.  David Winter is their defending candidate.  There is also a by-election in the neighbouring ward of <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i2961">South East Holderness</a>, a large rural area based on Withernsea and running to the now-island of Spurn.  This ward has had a full slate of Conservatives at every election this century, but Labour came close in by-elections in 2012 and 2016 (<em>Andrew's Previews 2016</em>, page 149) and UKIP were a strong second in 2015.  Despite this history, the Conservative candidate Claire Holmes should be favoured.

<h2>South Yorkshire</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

The South Yorkshire police and crime commissionership is held by Labour's Alan Billings, an academic and priest who has served since winning a by-election in 2014.  He was re-elected in the first round in 2016, polling 52% against 20% for UKIP and 11% for the Conservatives.

Although he is now well into his seventies, Billings is seeking a third term.  He won't face a UKIP candidate this time.  The Conservatives have selected former senior police officer David Chinchen, and Joe Otten completes the ballot paper for the Liberal Democrats.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

There are elections this year for the whole of Rotherham council on new ward boundaries, the whole of Doncaster council and one-third of Barnsley and Sheffield councils.

<b>Rotherham</b> council has had a troubled recent history, being taken over by Commissioners in 2014 following a huge child sexual exploitation scandal.  In that year's local elections the UK Independence Party won 10 seats on Rotherham council, which they increased to 14 at a whole-council election in 2016: Labour won 48 seats that year, and the remaining seat went to an independent candidate in Anston and Woodsetts ward.  This year's election will be on new ward boundaries.  The Rother Valley parliamentary seat, which the Conservatives gained in December 2019, is one of several constituencies with a Tory MP but no Tory local councillors; the party will have a chance to do something about that now.  Rotherham UKIP have since rebadged as the "Rotherham Democratic Party" and are not giving up their seats on the council without a fight.

<b>Doncaster</b> went over to the elected mayoral system some years ago.  The current mayor is Ros Jones of the Labour party, who narrowly defeated the English Democrats mayor Peter Davies in 2013; Jones had a much easier time in the 2017 mayoral election, winning in the first round with 51% of the vote against 21% for the Conservatives and 12% for UKIP.  She is backed up by a large Labour majority on Doncaster council: the simultaneous 2017 council election returned 43 Labour councillors, 7 Conservatives, 3 localists from Mexborough and two independents.

Jones is seeking re-election for a third term as Mayor.  The Conservatives have selected James Hart, a businessman and former leader of the Conservative group on the council, who is seeking to return to public office after standing down in 2017.  There's no UKIP candidate this time; the other candidates are independents Joan Briggs and Frank Calladine, Andy Budden for the Yorkshire Party, Warren Draper for the Greens and Surjit Singh Duhre for Reform UK.

Despite some extremely wacky results in 2019, including two seat gains for the Democrats and Veterans Party (the "gay donkey" UKIP splinter group), the Labour majority in <b>Barnsley</b> looks completely safe.

The big city of <b>Sheffield</b> should be more hotly contested.  The Labour group is currently on 45 councillors plus four vacant seats, with 43 being a majority; a repeat of the 2019 results would see Labour lose seven seats nett to the Lib Dems and Greens, putting that majority in danger.  Sheffield also has a <b>governance referendum</b>, on whether the council should abolish the leader and cabinet system and move to the committee system of governance.

<h2>Derbyshire</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

The Derbyshire PCC election in 2016 was very close.  In the first round Labour's Hardyal Singh Dhindsa led with just 37% of the vote, against 35% for the Conservatives' Richard Bright and 17% for UKIP.  Bright picked up most of the transfers in the runoff, but it wasn't enough as Dhindsa prevailed by 50.5% to 49.5%, a majority of 1,613 votes out of over 150,000.

Dhindsa is seeking re-election for Labour.  The Conservatives have selected Angelique Foster, a Derbyshire county councillor and leader of Dronfield town council.  UKIP haven't returned, so completing the Derbyshire PCC ballot paper are Stan Heptinstall for the Lib Dems and Tim Prosser for UKIP.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

There are elections this year for the whole of Derbyshire county council and for one-third of Amber Valley and Derby councils.

<b>Amber Valley</b> is a very swingy council based on the towns of Belper and Heanor to the north of Derby.  This was a Labour gain from the Conservatives in 2019, but the party will have a difficult time defending their majority; this year all the traditionally Labour-voting wards in the east of the district are due to poll. and the party is defending 11 of the 15 wards up for election.  If the Conservatives are having a good night, they have a realistic chance of making the gains they need for outright control.

The Conservatives do currently run <b>Derby</b> city council as a minority.  The city has become very politically balanced, with currently 19 Conservative councillors, 15 Labour, 8 Lib Dems, a five-strong Reform Derby group (who were elected on the UKIP ticket, and are standing in these elections with the joint nomination of Reform Derby and Reform UK), and three independents.  A repeat of the 2019 results would see the Conservatives lose 1 seat and Labour lose 2.  Derby is one of the few councils which will declare its ward results overnight, so expect some desperate spinning of its results on the Friday morning.

Derby city is not covered by <b>Derbyshire county council</b>, which has swung wildly between the two main parties at the last three elections: it was a Tory gain in 2009, a Labour gain in 2013 and a Tory gain again in 2017.  In seat terms the Conservative win four years ago looks pretty large - 37 seats against 24 Labour and 3 Lib Dems - but in vote terms it won't take that much of a swing for many of those seats to change hands.  For example, in the High Peak district the Conservatives hold three county seats in Buxton and Glossop on very small majorities; and the party hasn't performed particularly well there since, only narrowly gaining the High Peak constituency in December 2019 and resoundingly losing a by-election in Whaley Bridge to the former Labour MP two months later.  The Tory candidate to take Whaley Bridge back in this election certainly has name recognition - she is the former MP Edwina Currie.  Labour may have lost Dennis Skinner's Bolsover seat in December 2019, but given the majorities involved it will take another special Tory performance for them to gain any county divisions in that corner of Derbyshire.

This is borne out by the 2019 elections to <b>Bolsover</b> council, as while Labour did lose their majority there in 2019 it was mostly independent candidates who benefited from that.  Labour have a crucial by-election to defend here in the <a href="https://tinyurl.com/yd4q73fs">Bolsover North and Shuttlewood</a> ward, where they were opposed in 2019 only by a candidate from the left-wing Socialist Alternative; Donna Hales defends the seat for Labour, while the Socialist Alternative's Elaine Evans tries again with the nomination of the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition.  The village of Pinxton voted strongly for independent candidate James Watson in 2019, with Labour winning the ward's other seat; Watson's death has resulted in a free-for-all by-election, with Kevin Rose looking to succeed him as an independent and Labour nominating Stan Fox.  If Labour hold Bolsover North and Shuttlewood and gain Pinxton, they will regain their overall majority on the council.

The neighbouring district of <b>North East Derbyshire</b> now has a Conservative majority, as the memory of mining fades and towns like Eckington and Killamarsh continue their transition from industrial and pit settlements into dormitory towns for Sheffield just to the north.  The two Killamarsh wards now have a full slate of Conservative councillors, although in 2019 they did win the second seat in Killamarsh East by a majority of just one vote over Labour.  Both Killamarsh wards have by-elections following the resignations of Conservative councillors Kevin and Patricia Bone; in <a href="https://tinyurl.com/4zj2k9fp">East</a> ward David Drabble defends against Labour candidate John Windle, while in West ward the Conservative and Labour candidates are Alex Platts and Stuart Mullins respectively.  The neighbouring ward of Eckington South and Renishaw was Labour in 2019, but is having a by-election after Labour councillor Clive Hunt was disqualified under the six-month non-attendance rule; I'm not sure of the circumstances behind this, but Hunt is seeking re-election while the Conservatives have selected Philip Wheelhouse.

The Conservatives also have a majority on <b>Erewash</b> council, where Labour are defending two by-elections.  <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i17631">Hallam Fields</a>, the southern ward of Ilkeston, was very close in 2015 and 2019 between Labour and the Conservatives; Labour won both seats in 2019, gaining one from the Conservatives, and their defending candidate is Jo Ward while the Conservatives have selected Jon Wright.  Accordingly, the Lib Dems' Angela Togni is in the unusual position for a T of first on the ballot paper.  Labour have a larger majority in the <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i17637">Nottingham Road</a> ward of Long Eaton, based on the Trent railway junction, where their defending candidate is Adam Thompson.

"Some might say we will find a brighter day", according to the song by Oasis.  The cover photograph for their single <em>Some Might Say</em> was taken at Cromford railway station in the <b>Derbyshire Dales</b> district, which is part of the Masson ward of Derbyshire Dales district.  As well as Cromford, Masson ward also takes in the Little Switzerland of Matlock Bath, a spa village which is a huge tourist trap but worth a visit nonetheless.  This beautiful scenery is the backdrop to one of the crucibles of the Industrial Revolution: it was at Cromford in 1771 that Richard Arkwright set up the world's first water-powered textile mill, using his revolutionary spinning frame.  Arkwright's mill still stands today and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Arkwright's legacy to Cromford and the neighbouring town of Wirksworth is an engineering history and a large Labour vote.  Masson ward consistently turns in close results between Labour and the Conservatives, and has split its two seats between Labour and the Tories since 2011.  Labour are defending the <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i6799">Masson</a> by-election on 6th May; their candidate is Nicholas Whitehead, while the Conservatives have selected Dermot Murphy.  <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i6806">Wirksworth</a> is the safest Labour ward within the Derbyshire Dales district, and their candidate Dawn Greatorex should be favoured to hold the by-election there.

Earlier in this section I mentioned Edwina Currie, who was the Conservative MP for <b>South Derbyshire</b> from 1983 to 1997.  This is the sort of area which has swung strongly to the Conservatives in recent years; the December 2019 general election gave the Conservative candidate Heather Wheeler a majority of over 19,000 votes, and the May 2019 re-elected the Tory administration on South Derbyshire council (which has the same boundaries as the parliamentary seat) with a 22-14 majority over Labour.  All seemed set fair; but in December 2020 the ruling Conservative group on the council suffered a huge split, and Labour have taken over as a minority administration.

The four South Derbyshire council by-elections on 6th May - and the Conservatives are defending all four of them - will be the electorate's first chance to make their views clear on this takeover.  The Tories will be helped by the lack of any candidates from the dissident group.  They are safe in <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i11156">Hilton</a> ward (covering eight parishes on the main road towards Uttoxeter), where two of the three seats are up for election and are defended by Gillian Lemmon and Peter Smith.  <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i11162">Seales</a> ward, the southernmost point of Derbyshire, covers six parishes including the village of Coton in the Elms; this is recognised as the farthest point in the UK from the sea, being 70 miles from the Wash, the Dee Estuary and the Severn Estuary.  Seales ward is also safe Conservative, with Simon Ackroyd defending.  Things are politically very different in the <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i11153">Church Gresley</a> ward of Swadlincote, which split its three seats between two Labour candidates and one Conservative in both 2015 and 2019; the Tories' Roger Redfern will defend this marginal against Labour's Sue Taylor.  If Labour can gain the Church Gresley by-election, they will remain as the largest party on South Derbyshire council unless the Conservatives and ex-Conservatives can settle their differences.

<h2>Nottinghamshire</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

The Nottinghamshire PCC since 2012 has been Paddy Tipping, the former Labour MP for the Sherwood constituency who served for a time as Deputy Leader of the Commons during the last Labour Government.  Tipping was re-elected quite easily in 2016: in the first round he led with 47% against 28% for the Conservatives and 12% for UKIP, and he increased his lead to 62-38 in the runoff.

Tipping is seeking a third term of office.  He is up against Conservative candidate Caroline Henry, a businesswoman.  UKIP have not stood again, so completing the ballot paper is David Watts for the Lib Dems.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

There are elections this year for Nottinghamshire county council only.  There are no local elections this year in the city of Nottingham.

The Conservatives have had spectacular success in Nottinghamshire at parliamentary level in recent years.  They now hold all eight constituencies in the area covered by the <b>county council</b>, having gained Ashfield and Bassetlaw in 2019 to add to the gain of Mansfield in 2017.  The task now for the party is to make this dominance stick at county council level, as the Tories do not have a majority at the county hall in West Bridgford and are governing in coalition with the Mansfield Independent Forum.  That group along with the Zadroznyite Ashfield Independents will form a large independent bloc on the new county council, so for the gains they need for a majority the Tories will likely have to look elsewhere: perhaps in the northern Nottingham suburbs of Arnold and Carlton, where there are a number of marginal Labour divisions.  The Tories must have carried a number of divisions in Worksop in December 2019 given their huge majority in Bassetlaw, but as in neighbouring Bolsover the Labour county councillors there are sitting on very large majorities from May 2017.

In fact the May 2019 local elections in <b>Bassetlaw</b> were pretty poor for the Conservatives, who lost all but one of their seats within the Bassetlaw constituency.  They have a good chance to get two of those seats back on 6th May.  <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i7706">Sutton</a> ward, covering a number of villages to the west and north of Retford, was gained from the Conservatives in 2019 by independent candidate Rob Boeuf; no independent candidate has come forward to succeed Boeuf, and the seat should revert to the Conservatives who have selected Denise Depledge.  Immediately to the north of Sutton ward is <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i7704">Ranskill</a> ward, which was a very surprising gain in 2019 for Labour partly thanks to the outgoing Tory councillor Michael Gray seeking re-election as an independent and splitting the right-wing vote.  Labour haven't found a candidate to replace Nicholls, so the Ranskill by-election is likely to be gained by either the Tories' Gerald Bowers or by Michael Gray, who is standing again.  Within Bassetlaw district but part of the Newark constituency is the <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i7707">Tuxford and Trent</a> ward, which takes in the former power station site at High Marnham and one of Network Rail's test tracks for new rail vehicles; this was close in 2019 between the Conservative slate and an independent, but with the independent not returning the Tories' Lewis Stanniland should be favoured.

The Conservatives defend two other Nottinghamshire by-elections caused by newly-elected MPs vacating their district council seats.  Brendan Clarke-Smith, the new Bassetlaw MP, was a <b>Newark and Sherwood</b> councillor for <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i17234">Boughton</a> ward, located a few miles west of Tuxford and on the border of his constituency.  This is part of the Nottinghamshire coalfield, which was operating round here until just a few years ago; Boughton ward was very close between the Tories and Labour in both 2015 and 2019, with Clarke-Smith gaining it in the latter year.  Another close contest between defending Conservative candidate Tim Wildgust and Labour's Derek Batey can be expected.  The Tories don't have many council seats in <b>Mansfield</b>, but one of them was held by Lee Anderson who is now the MP for Ashfield; Anderson represented the <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i11083">Oakham</a> ward on the southern edge of Mansfield, which he gained from the Mansfield Independent Forum in 2019.  The Tories have selected Robert Ellman to hold the Oakham by-election, while the result of the Forum's candidate Kevin Brown may be an early pointer as to whether they can get the Mansfield mayoralty back from Labour in 2023.

Lee Anderson had got elected to Parliament the hard way, as he had to defeat Jason Zadrozny who bestrides <b>Ashfield</b> politics like a colossus.  Zadrozny is the leader of Ashfield council at the head of his own party, the Ashfield Independents, and most of the candidates on his slate were elected with enormous shares of the vote in 2019.  This column has seen nothing like it since the Lib Dem takeover of Kendal nearly twenty years ago.  The Ashfield Independents are defending two by-elections: in <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i17711">Skegby</a> ward (the north-eastern ward of Sutton-in-Ashfield), after the council chairman Anthony Brewer died of COVID; and in <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i17695">Annesley and Kirkby Woodhouse</a> ward next to the M1 motorway.  Both of these wards were over 70% Zadroznyite in 2019, so it will take a lot for the defending candidates Jamie Bell (Annesley and Kirkby Woodhouse) and Will Bostock (Skegby) to lose these.

Things are more politically normal in the final three Nottinghamshire by-elections.  Labour have two safe wards to defend in the <b>Broxtowe</b> district, covering a number of towns to the west of Nottingham; in Stapleford Sue Paterson defends the <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i17568">South West</a> ward, while in Beeston Shaun Dannheimer is the party's candidate to hold <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i17555">Rylands</a> ward.  Over the Trent we have a safe Conservative defence to <b>Rushcliffe</b> council: Matt Barney should be favoured to hold the ward based on the village of <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i19439">Sutton Bonington</a>.

<h2>Lincolnshire</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

The 2016 Lincolnshire PCC election turned in a fragmented first-round result after the independent incumbent retired.  In a field of four candidates the Conservatives' Marc Jones led with 35% against 26% for UKIP candidate Victoria Ayling, 23% for Labour and 17% for the Lincolnshire Independents, a long-standing group of independent county councillors.  Jones and Ayling went into the runoff, which Jones won 56-44 to gain the position for the Conservatives.

Marc Jones is seeking re-election for a second term, and this time he won't have to face a UKIP candidate.  Labour have selected Lincoln city councillor Rosanne Kirk.  The Lincolnshire Independents have returned with their candidate David Williams, a former army officer who chairs the Lincolnshire Police Independent Advisory Group.  Also standing are Ross Pepper for the Liberal Democrats and Peter Escreet for Reform UK.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

There are elections this year for the whole of Lincolnshire county council and for one-third of Lincoln council.  These shouldn't see much excitement.  <b>Lincoln</b> city council is the only Labour-controlled district in Lincolnshire; their majority over the Conservatives is 24-9, and a repeat of the 2019 results would see three Tory seats flip to Labour.  <b>Lincolnshire county council</b> returned a large Tory majority in the 2017 election, after a sizeable UKIP caucus in the 2013-17 term fell apart; unless something similarly seismic happens the Conservatives are in no danger at the county hall this time.

The Tories are defending four of the five by-elections to Lincolnshire's district councils.  The odd one out is the <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i7973">Bassingham and Brant Broughton</a> ward of <b>North Kesteven</b> district, which covers nine rural parishes east of Newark and south of Lincoln; this is normally a Tory ward but it was taken over by the Lincolnshire Independents in 2019, and their defending candidate Penelope Bauer will seek to defend against the Tories' Russell Eckert.  In <b>South Kesteven</b> district the Tories defend <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i16684">Glen</a> ward, which covers a number of villages to the west of Bourne including Little Bytham on the East Coast main line; this is very strongly Conservative and their candidate Penny Robins is opposed only by Labour.

The one genuinely urban Lincolnshire by-election on 6th May has given this column an awful lot of grief in trying to sort out what is going on.  <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i16925">Skirbeck</a> ward covers the docks of <b>Boston</b>, straddling both sides of the River Witham.  In 2015, the first contest on the present boundaries, it elected one councillor each for UKIP, the Conservatives and Labour; in 2019 UKIP gave up their seat without a fight and Labour were defeated, the three councillors elected being Alistair Arundell for the Conservatives and independent candidates Anne Dorrian and Colin Woodcock.  Arundell resigned shortly afterwards, and a by-election was held alongside the December 2019 general election (<em>Andrew's Previews 2019</em>, page 398) which was convincingly held by new Conservative candidate Martin Howard.  Howard announced in July 2020 that he would step down to allow a by-election to be held in May 2021.  Independent councillor Colin Woodcock then handed in his resignation in October 2020.  As it turns out, Martin Howard never followed through on his resignation announcement and is still a Boston councillor, so this Skirbeck by-election is for Woodcock's seat only.  Two independent candidates, Dale Broughton and Christopher Cardwell, are seeking to succeed Woodcock, but if the December 2019 by-election is any guide the Tories' Katie Chalmers should start as favourite here.

Things have got even more complicated on the beaches of Lincolnshire's east coast.  There is a localist party here, the Skegness Urban District Society, which is seeking self-governance for Skeggy and won six seats in the 2019 <b>East Lindsey</b> council elections.  The SUDS are now looking to clean up at Lincolnshire county council level, and they have nominated seven candidates - rather ambitious given that Skegness only has two county council seats and the other five candidates are standing for divisions outside the town.  Two of these candidates are Steve Walmsley, who was nominated for Ingoldmells Rural county division; and Danny Brookes, who was nominated for both Ingoldmells Rural and Mablethorpe divisions.  The deputy returning officer will have pointed out to Brookes that he could only stand for one of those, so he withdrew - from Mablethorpe, leaving SUDS with two candidates for one seat in Ingoldmells Rural.

The plot thickens when you consider that Ingoldmells Rural includes the East Lindsey ward of <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i17177">Chapel St Leonards</a>.  One of the oldest wards in England by population (in 2011 71% of the population were aged 45 or over - the place must be almost fully vaccinated by now), the seaside resort of Chapel St Leonards can be found about five miles north of Skegness.  This is within range for the Skegness Urban District Society, and they have nominated a candidate for the East Lindsey council by-election here - but not Danny Brookes or Steve Walmsley.  Instead, the SUDS candidate for the Chapel St Leonards by-election is Ady Findley, while Steve Walmsley is contesting the by-election as an independent.  Confused?  You will be.  The Conservatives are defending the by-election with Graham Williams as their candidate, while Labour - who won a by-election here in 2013 and weren't far off holding their seat in 2015 - have selected Isaac Bailey to complete the ballot paper.

Thankfully our final by-election within Lincolnshire is strange only in the sense that the voters of <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i19406">Kelsey Wold</a> ward will be electing a successor to the late Tory district and county councillor Lewis Strange.  Strange had won his final term in 2019 in this ward of <b>West Lindsey</b>, based on the villages of North and South Kelsey between Brigg and Market Rasen, comfortably enough that new Conservative candidate Peter Morris should have few problems in holding the by-election.

<h2>Northamptonshire</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

Northants' police and crime commissioner election in 2016 was a three-way fight.  The first round was relatively close with 41% for the new Conservative candidate Stephen Mold, 36% for Labour and 24% for UKIP; UKIP's transfers broke for the Conservatives giving them a 54-46 win in the final reckoning.

Stephen Mold is seeking a second term.  Labour have selected Claire Pavitt, who was their parliamentary candidate for Kettering in December 2019.  UKIP have not returned, so completing the ballot paper are Ana Gunn for the Liberal Democrats and Mark Hearn for Reform UK.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

Northamptonshire's local government has been reorganised this year following the financial failure of Northamptonshire county council.  2021 sees the inaugural elections for the two new councils of North Northamptonshire and West Northamptonshire.

<b>West Northamptonshire</b> is the larger of the two with around 307,000 electors on the roll.  The county town of Northampton accounts for slightly under half of the electorate, and should be comfortably outvoted by the former rural districts of Daventry and South Northamptonshire which are generally true blue.  Similar considerations apply in <b>North Northamptonshire</b>, which succeeds the former districts of Corby, East Northamptonshire, Kettering and Wellingborough.  Corby is a strongly Labour-voting town, and the party can also perform decently in Kettering, but politically these will be red islands in a large blue lake.  Mind, we only have parliamentary election data from Northamptonshire in recent years, because the May 2019 elections for all the districts here were cancelled in advance of the reorganisation.

<h2>Leicestershire</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

Leicestershire's police and crime commissionership was gained by Labour in the 2016 election.  Lord Bach, who served as a junior minister for much of the Blair and Brown years in the defence and environment departments and the whip's office, led in the first round with 45% against 31% for the Conservatives and 13% for the Liberal Democrats; in the final reckoning he beat the Conservatives 57-43.

Bach is not standing again.  The Labour candidate here is local government veteran Ross Willmott, who was first elected to Leicester city council in 1983.  Willmott was leader of that council from 1999 until 2010, when he resigned the leadership to unsuccessfully contest North West Leicestershire in that year's general election.  The Tories have selected Rupert Matthews, a former Kingston upon Thames councillor and prolific author on paranormal subjects; Matthews was a Conservative MEP for the East Midlands from 2017 to 2019.  Completing the ballot paper is the Lib Dems' James Moore, a former Hinckley and Bosworth councillor who currently teaches history and politics at Leicester University.  One thing to look out for in the Leicestershire PCC count is differential turnout, because there are no scheduled local elections in the Labour stronghold of Leicester to boost turnout for the PCC contest.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

There are, however, elections this year for <b>Leicestershire county council</b>.  Unlike the PCC position this has a large Conservative majority thanks to the absence of Labour-voting Leicester city, which has unitary status; the Lib Dems form the main opposition on the county council thanks to their strength in Oadby, Wigston and Hinckley.  The 2017 election returned 36 Conservatives, 13 Lib Dems and 6 Labour councillors.  Not much is likely to change here.

As stated, there are no local elections this year in the city of <b>Leicester</b> apart from a by-election in the <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i17492">North Evington</a> ward.  At one point named as the UK's COVID hotspot, North Evington is a majority-Asian area about a mile east of Leicester city centre, which returned very high Labour votes in 2015 and 2019.  Nine candidates have come forward for the by-election, but it will probably take a lot for any of them to defeat Labour's Vandevi Pandya.

There are four local by-elections within the Leicestershire county council area, and we should start our discussion with the <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i17356">Worthington and Breedon</a> ward of <b>North West Leicestershire</b> which covers a number of villages between East Midlands Airport and Ashby de la Zouch.  The ward's Conservative councillor David Stevenson, who had sat on North West Leicestershire council for all but one term since the council's first election in 1973, passed away in early November of 2019.  No move was made by the local Conservatives to call a by-election over the winter, and the subsequent suspension of by-elections means that Worthington and Breedon's residents have now been without a councillor for almost eighteen months.  Even given the exceptional circumstances of the last year and a bit, this should not have been allowed to drag on so long.

Stevenson enjoyed a large majority in Worthington and Breedon, and while his successor as Tory candidate Raymond Morris might not serve for quite as long he shouldn't have much trouble holding the by-election.  Things are rather different in <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i17342">Ibstock East</a> ward on the same council.  This has been a Labour-inclined marginal in recent years, with Labour increasing their majority over the Conservatives to 10 points in 2019; but the outgoing Labour councillor Daniel Tebbutt, who was elected to the council at the age of just 18, defected to the Conservatives after four months in office and then resigned.  The resulting Ibstock East by-election looks set to be an interesting contest between Labour's Carissma Griffiths and the Tories' Jenny Simmons.

Another relatively young Leicestershire councillor to have resigned recently is Frankie McHugo, who was first elected to <b>Harborough</b> council in 2011 at the age of 21.  A blog post on <em>Conservative Home</em> from the time (<a href="https://conservativehome.blogs.com/gazette/2011/05/who-is-the-youngest-conservative-councillor-in-the-country-reprise.html">link</a>) listed her among twelve Conservative councillors under the age of 23.  At least three of the councillors in that list (Jack Brereton, Jonathan Gullis and Gary Sambrook) are now MPs, although the presence of Gary Sambrook there is an error: as long-term readers of Andrew's Previews will know, Sambrook wasn't first elected to Birmingham city council until he won a by-election in February 2014.  Keep an eye on this column after 6th May, you might just be seeing the stars of the future take their first steps into elected office.

Anyway, Frankie McHugo served until 2015 when she stood down from Harborough council, then returned in 2019 as one of the two councillors for <a href="https://tinyurl.com/994p2uwv">Market Harborough - Little Bowden</a> ward, which is the south-eastern of Market Harborough's four wards.  Her resignation creates a by-election in a marginal ward - the other councillor here is a Lib Dem.  The defending Conservative candidate is Peter Critchley, while the Lib Dems' James Ward will look to gain.

Our final Leicestershire by-election takes place in the <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i7506">Stanton and Flamville</a> ward, which covers five parishes between Hinckley and the Fosse Way but is administered as part of the <b>Blaby</b> local government district.  This ward is sufficiently safe for the Conservatives that nobody bothered to oppose their slate here in 2019; the defending Conservative candidate Mike Shirley will, however, face a contest in this by-election.

The Leicestershire police area includes Rutland, where there are no council elections this year.

<h2>Warwickshire</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

Independent Warwickshire PCC Ron Ball retired at the 2016 election leaving the position open.  On the first count the Conservatives led with 31%, Labour had 25%, UKIP 13% and independent candidate Dave Whitehouse 11%; the Tories and Labour went through to the runoff where the Conservatives won by 55-45.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

There are elections this year for the whole of Warwickshire county council, for one-half of Nuneaton and Bedworth council, and for one-third of Rugby council.

The main contest here will be in <b>Nuneaton and Bedworth</b> which is currently on a knife-edge.  The ruling Labour group has 17 seats - half of the council - with the Conservatives on 14, the Greens on 1 and two independents (who were elected for the Conservatives).  This is one of the handful of councils which renew half of their members at every election, so the last local elections here were in May 2018 - and a repeat of those results would see the Conservatives gain six seats and a comfortable majority to go with their lead in the Nuneaton and North Warwickshire parliamentary seats.

The good Conservative result in Nuneaton and Bedworth in May 2018 was also seen at the <b>Warwickshire county elections</b> in May 2017 and allowed the Tories to gain overall control of the county hall in Warwick.  The 2017 elections in Warwickshire returned 36 Conservatives, 10 Labour, 7 Lib Dems, two Greens and two localist independents.  Labour will need to do a lot better in Nuneaton and Bedworth to force a hung council here.

The North Warwickshire constituency includes Bedworth together with the whole of the <b>North Warwickshire</b> local government district, which is based on the towns of Atherstone and Polesworth.  Both of those towns see by-elections to the district council with Labour defending.  <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i6573">Polesworth East</a> is a safe Labour ward which shouldn't give their defending candidate Emma Whapples too much trouble.  Although <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i6560">Atherstone Central</a> ward has had a full slate of Labour councillors since a 2009 by-election, it remains marginal in vote terms and promises to be a close contest between Sara Bishop (Labour, defending) and Mark Jordan (Conservative).  Although their resigning councillor had previously left the party and gone independent, the Conservatives should be given very little trouble in <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i6566">Curdworth</a> ward, covering a number of villages east of Sutton Coldfield and south of Tamworth together with the Belfry golf club; their defending candidate is Sandra Smith.

<b>Rugby</b> council has a small Conservative majority which looks safe enough.  A repeat of the 2019 results would see just one seat change hands, the Conservatives picking up the rural Dunsmore ward from an independent councillor.

The only other poll to report on here is a by-election to <b>Warwick</b> council from <a href="https://tinyurl.com/4cemwj2c">Leamington Clarendon</a> ward.  This is the town centre ward for Leamington Spa, taking in all the glorious Georgian buildings on the Parade and a fair amount of deprivation and student lets in the terraces behind.  Clarendon was close in 2019 between Labour and the Liberal Democrats, and it will be interesting to see whether the student vote appears here at all given that Warwick University is generally closed to in-person teaching.  The defending Labour candidate is Colin Quinney, while Hugh Foden challenges for the Lib Dems.

<h2>West Midlands</h2>

<h3>Mayor of the West Midlands</h3>

Both of the West Midlands metropolitan area's major elected officials will be up for election this year.  On paper the mayoralty is the more interesting position, as this was very close in 2017.  The first count gave Conservative candidate Andy Street, a former head of the John Lewis Partnership, a 42-41 lead over Birmingham Labour MP Siôn Simon; Simon got slightly more transfers, but it wasn't enough to take the lead in the runoff which Street won by 50.4-49.6, a majority of 3,766 votes across the county.

This election is significant enough that two opinion polls have been commissioned for it.  Over the Easter weekend a poll by Find Out New and Electoral Calculus for the <em>Daily Telegraph</em> gave Andy Street a 45-38 lead over the Labour candidate on first preferences, narrowing to 52-48 in the runoff.  Redfield and Wilton were in the field from 18 to 21 April, giving Street a 46-37 lead on first preferences.  These polls will be rather discouraging to the Labour candidate, who is another Birmingham Labour MP: Liam Byrne has represented the Hodge Hill constituency since winning a by-election in 2004, and is perhaps best known for the "I'm afraid there is no money" note which he left for his successor as a Treasury minister after the Labour government's defeat in 2010.  Also standing this time are Jenny Wilkinson for the Lib Dems, Pete Durnell (who was the UKIP candidate four years ago) for the Reform Party, and Steve Caudwell for the Greens.

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

By contrast the West Midlands police and crime commissionership, despite covering the same area, has always been safe for Labour.  This post has been held by Michael Jamieson since he won a by-election in 2014.  At the 2016 election Jamieson was less than a thousand votes short of being re-elected in the first round, polling 50% against 26% for the Conservatives and 17% for UKIP; in the final reckoning he beat the Conservative candidate 63-37.

Jamieson is standing down, and Labour have selected Simon Foster, a solicitor.  The Conservative candidate is Jay Singh Sohal, a former TV journalist who is now a communications director.  Also standing are independent candidate Jools Hambleton, Mark Hoath for Reform UK, Jon Hunt for the Liberal Democrat and Desmond Jaddoo, leader of the newly-formed We Matter Party.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

As in 2019, <b>Dudley</b> council is the West Midlands borough to watch.  This currently stands at 35 Labour councillors, 34 Conservatives, two independents and one vacancy; the Conservatives have a minority administration, and the casting vote of the mayor helps in that.  This year the ward map is in the Tories' favour; the 2016 results here had Labour winning 14 wards, the Conservatives 9 and UKIP 1, while in 2019 the Conservatives won 13 wards to Labour's 11.  That would suggest that the Conservatives should be favoured for an overall majority here.

The Tories already have a majority in <b>Walsall</b>, although only a thin one: 31 councillors against 26 Labour, two Lib Dems and an independent.  Again, this year the ward map is in their favour: a repeat of the 2019 results would see the Conservatives gain 3 Labour wards and all 3 of the seats held by other parties.

A sterner test for the government party will be to see whether they can make any headway in <b>Sandwell</b>.  This is the Black Country council which includes the two West Bromwich constituencies, both of which were Tory gains in December 2019; however, the last three Sandwell council elections have returned 72 Labour councillors out of a possible 72.  Judging from the May 2019 results the Tories should have their eyes on gaining Blackheath ward (based on Rowley Regis), but anything else looks a very tall order.

On the far side of Birmingham, the Conservatives have suddenly found themselves in trouble in <b>Solihull</b> where their majority is down to 26 seats out of 51.  The opposition here is an unlikely one: it's the Green Party, who have broken through in some of the bourgeois ex-Liberal parts of Solihull proper <em>and</em> the tower blocks of Chelmsley Wood and Castle Bromwich.  A repeat of the 2019 results would see the Conservatives lose Castle Bromwich ward to the Greens; although they should pick up a safe ward from a defector who is not standing again, if the Tories lose anything else then their majority on the council would go.

There are no local elections this year to <b>Birmingham</b> city council apart from four by-elections.  In the north of the city we have the 1930s and 1940s estates of <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i18732">Oscott</a> ward; in the west former Labour council leader John Clancy has vacated <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i18736">Quinton</a> ward, off the main road towards Hagley and Kidderminster; while in the south of the city there are by-elections in the neighbouring wards of <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i18697">Billesley</a> and <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i18713">Hall Green North</a>.  All of these are Labour defences with only Hall Green North (defended for them by Saima Suleman) looking completely safe.  At the last city council elections in 2018 Labour had a 2-point lead in Quinton, and leads of just over 10 points in Billesley and Oscott.  Quinton will be defended for Labour by Elaine Kidney, with the Conservatives selecting Dominic Stanford; in Oscott the two major-party candidates are Uzma Ahmed for Labour and Darius Sandhu for the Tories.  The Billesley by-election has attracted no fewer than nine candidates, with Katherine Carlisle as the defending Labour candidate and Clair Felton challenging for the Tories.

The Labour majorities in <b>Coventry</b> and <b>Wolverhampton</b> are impregnable.

<h2>Staffordshire</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

The Staffordshire PCC position has been held since 2012 by the Conservatives' Matthew Ellis.  In 2016 Ellis led the first round rather narrowly with 36% against 31% for Labour and 16% for UKIP; he increased his lead in the final round, but only to 53-47.

This year Ellis is standing down.  The Conservatives have selected Ben Adams, a long-serving Staffordshire county councillor who was their parliamentary candidate for Stoke-on-Trent North in 2015 and 2017.  The Labour candidate is Tony Kearson, a Newcastle-under-Lyme councillor and criminologist.  UKIP haven't returned, so completing the ballot paper are independent candidate Deneice Florence-Jukes, Michael Riley for Reform UK and Richard Whelan for the Lib Dems.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

There are elections this year for the whole of Staffordshire county council and for one-third of Cannock Chase and Tamworth councils.

<b>Staffordshire county council</b> has had a large Conservative majority since 2009, when the ruling Labour group crashed from 32 seats to just 3.  The local Labour party has never really recovered from that experience, although they didn't do quite as badly in the 2017 election which returned 51 Conservatives, 10 Labour and an independent.  Any Labour recovery would need to start in Cannock, Tamworth and Newcastle-under-Lyme, and pre-pandemic results from Newcastle do not give much indication of that happening.  What about Cannock and Tamworth, though?

Well, Labour do retain <b>Cannock Chase</b> council, but only as a minority after losing overall control in 2019.  Going into these elections there are 17 Labour councillors, 15 Conservative seats (one of which is vacant), 2 Lib Dems and 7 others, most of whom were originally elected for the Green Party which has suffered a split here.  More than half of the Labour group is up for re-election this year, and a repeat of the 2019 results would see the Conservatives become the largest party here.

And there's not much sign of a Labour revival in <b>Tamworth</b> either.  The Conservatives have had a large majority here for a long time now - currently 21 seats against 5 Labour, 2 UKIP and 2 independents.  A repeat of the 2019 results would see the Conservatives gain one seat each from Labour and UKIP, who are still active in Tamworth and have nominated a full slate of candidates for the borough elections.

There are no local elections this year in <b>Stoke-on-Trent</b> apart from a by-election following the abrupt resignation in May 2020 of councillor Mohammed Pervez.  He had been leader of the Labour group on the council since 2010, and until 2015 was leader of the council.  Pervez had a strong majority in <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i11053">Moorcroft</a> ward, which covers the southern end of Burslem, and new Labour councillor Javed Najmi will be hoping to defend that.  Regrettably, the voters of Moorcroft will not have the chance to vote for the Official Monster Raving Loony Party's candidate Sir Honkey Tonk James, who had turned 18 by polling day but was underage on the day his nomination papers went in; the Returning Officer, on the time-honoured principle of "I'd love to help you son, but you're too young to vote", rejected James' nomination.

Outside the Potteries we have four by-elections for five seats.  Two of these occur in the town of Cheadle, within the <b>Staffordshire Moorlands</b> district.  Cheadle's three wards returned a full set of independent councillors in 2019 with large majorities, but both of these by-elections see multiple independent candidates who could split the vote.  In <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i5201">North East</a> ward those are Liz Whitehouse - niece of the late councillor Ian Whitehouse whose death caused the by-election - and Paulette Upton, while <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i5202">Cheadle South East</a> ward is contested on the independent side by Jamie Evans, Colin Pearce and Alan Thomas.

<b>East Staffordshire</b> district has a double by-election for both seats in <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i5077">Eton Park</a> ward.  This is not as bucolic as it sounds.  Eton Park ward is the northern end of Burton upon Trent, and the area is dominated by a large Pirelli tyre factory.  The ward was safe Labour until 2019 when one of its two seats was taken by independent candidate Dale Spedding.  Long-time readers of Andrew's Previews may recognise that name.  Spedding won a by-election to the East Staffordshire council in the neighbouring Stretton ward in 2017, with the Conservative nomination (<em>Andrew's Previews 2017</em>, page 263), then resigned two months later over harassment he was getting from his constituents (<em>Andrew's Previews 2018</em>, page 50).  He lasted a little longer on the council second time round, but still didn't make it into a second year before resigning: the double by-election to replace Spedding and the late Labour councillor Sonia Andjelkovic was originally scheduled for 26th March 2020 before the pandemic intervened.  There is no independent candidate this time to replace Spedding so his seat is open, and it should revert back to Labour: the Labour slate here is Louise Walker (who was runner-up in the 2019 election) and Thomas Hadley.

Finally, we come to the <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i17692">Summerfield and All Saints</a> ward of Lichfield district, which again is less scenic than the name might suggest: this is the central of the five wards covering the former mining town of Burntwood.  Summerfield and All Saints elected a full slate of three Conservative councillors in 2015, but Labour gained two seats in 2019 and are defending this by-election.  A closely-watched contest can be expected between defending Labour cndidate Michael Galvin and the Tories' Heather Tranter.

<h2>West Mercia</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

The West Mercia police area covers three counties in the Severn and Wye valleys in the west of England: Worcestershire, Shropshire and Herefordshire.  The 2012 PCC election returned an independent candidate, Bill Longmore, who didn't seek re-election in 2016.  Five years ago the Conservatives topped the poll here with 33% against 21% for Labour, 17% for UKIP and 14% for an independent candidate; the Conservatives' John-Paul Campion and Labour's Daniel Walton went through to the runoff, which Campion won 60-40.

Campion is seeking re-election for a second term.  The Labour candidate this time is Telford and Wrekin councillor Kuldip Sahota.  Peter Jewell, who was the UKIP candidate five years ago, now has the Reform UK nomination.  Completing the ballot paper is Margaret Rowley of the Liberal Democrats.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

There are elections this year for the whole of Shropshire council and Worcestershire county council and for one-third of Redditch and Worcester councils.

To start in <b>Redditch</b>, which is a quasi-New Town with voting patterns to match.  The Conservatives run Redditch council with an 18-11 lead over Labour, and no fewer than seven of the Labour councillors are up for re-election this year.  A par score for the is difficult to assess, because of the way Redditch's wards come up for election, but would involve significant Conservative gains.

<b>Worcester</b> city council is currently hung: the Conservatives have 16 seats, Labour 15, the Greens 3 and the Lib Dems 1.  An all-party administration is in place.  The Conservatives will have their eye on gaining the city-centre Cathedral ward which they won two years ago, but the second gain they require for an overall majority may prove elusive.

<b>Worcestershire county council</b> has a big Conservative majority and that looks unlikely to change.  The 2017 election here returned 40 Conservative councillors, 10 Labour, 3 Lib Dems, 2 Greens, 1 Kidderminster Health Concern and an independent.

The only local by-election within Worcestershire has fallen in the by-election-prone ward of <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i5589">Elmley Castle and Somerville</a>, covering seven parishes in the Vale of Evesham to the north and east of Bredon Hill.  This is a safely Conservative ward of <b>Wychavon</b> council which has generated a number of casual vacancies in the last decade.  Elmley Castle and Somerville was represented by Anna Mackison until she died shortly before the 2011 election; it appears that nobody was planning to oppose her that year as no candidates were nominated for the ward, so a by-election had to be held in June 2011 which was won by the Tories' Roma Kirke.  Kirke resigned shortly before the 2015 election, which was held for the Conservatives by Anna's widower George Mackison.  George has now resigned in his turn, and Emma Kearsey will look to defend the ward for the Tories in a straight fight with the Green Party.

The ruling Conservative group on <b>Shropshire</b> council attracted rather a lot of bad publicity over the last decade, although the last term does seem to have been significantly quieter on that front suggesting things may have calmed down somewhat.  The Tories are defending a large majority from the 2017 election which returned 49 Conservatives, 12 Lib Dems, 8 Labour (all from Shrewsbury and the satellite village of Bayston Hill), three independents, a Green councillor and a representative of Kidderminster Health Concern (in Cleobury Mortimer, for which Kidderminster is the main service centre).  The Conservative defence will be helped by the fact that they have held Albrighton division unopposed - that's the only uncontested seat on the British mainland in this year's local elections.

There are no local elections this year in Herefordshire or Telford and Wrekin apart from three by-elections.  In <b>Herefordshire</b> we pay a visit to <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i17011">Newton Farm</a> ward on the south-western edge of Hereford, which elected independent candidates in the 2015 and 2019 elections; two new independents have come forward here in the shape of Alan Jones and Glenda Powell.  Jones appears to be fighting his first election campaign; Powell was the runner-up here in 2015 as an independent, and finished fourth in 2019 with the Democrats and Veterans Party nomination.  Second in this ward last time were the Lib Dems, whose candidate Jacqui Carwardine is standing again.  The Labour candidate Steve Horsfield also deserves a mention thanks to his TikTok campaign video, which has become an <a href="https://www.herefordtimes.com/news/19238503.hereford-labour-councillor-candidates-tiktok-video-goes-viral/">unlikely viral hit</a>.

Labour have two by-elections to defend in <b>Telford and Wrekin</b>.  <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i16623">Dawley and Aqueduct</a> ward is in the south of the New Town (which was originally going to be called Dawley), while <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i16624">Donnington</a> ward is in the north-east corner of Telford on the way to Newport.  Both of these wards were safe Labour in 2019, and the defending candidates are Ian Preece and Sophie Thompson respectively.

<h2>Gloucestershire</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

The post of Gloucestershire PCC has been held since 2012 by retired senior police officer Martin Surl, who was elected in 2012 and 2016 as an independent candidate.  At the 2016 election Surl led in the first round with 41%, to 35% for the Conservatives and 24% for Labour; the Labour transfers broke heavily for Surl who won the run-off by the comfortable margin of 59-41.

Surl is seeking a third term.  The Conservatives have selected Chris Nelson, a retired Army officer and former Cheltenham councillor.  The Labour candidate is Simon O'Rourke, from Tewkesbury, and the ballot paper is completed by Lib Dem Christopher Coleman and independent candidate Adrian "Stratts" Stratton.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

There are elections this year for the whole of Gloucestershire county council and Gloucester and Stroud councils, and for one-half of Cheltenham council.

<b>Gloucestershire county council</b> was a Conservative gain in 2013 and has a relatively small majority: there are 31 Conservative seats against 14 Lib Dems, 5 Labour, 2 Greens and one county councillor for the People Against Bureaucracy Group, a long-standing localist group based in northern Cheltenham.  With a number of Tory-held divisions across the county having small majorities, it won't take much of an unwind for a No Overall Control result.

<b>Gloucester</b> city council is in a similar position.  It last polled in 2016, when the Conservatives won 22 seats in Gloucester against 10 for Labour and 7 Lib Dems.  The ruling group has since lost a by-election to the Lib Dems and has two further vacancies; unfortunately one of these is an entry for the Councillors Behaving Badly file, because Conservative councillor Lee Hawthorne resigned after becoming one of the first people to be charged under recently-enacted laws against upskirting.  Despite that scandal, the Conservative majority in Gloucester is probably stronger than it appears as most of their wards look fairly safe.

In <b>Stroud</b> district, which also last polled in 2016, the Conservatives are the largest party but the administration is a coalition of Labour, the Greens and the Liberal Democrats.  The Tories will have to improve their position here significantly to take over the council.  One-half of Cheltenham council is also up for election; this borough has a large Lib Dem majority which does not look in serious danger.

The four local by-elections in Gloucestershire consist of two either side of the Severn.  On the east side, the Conservatives defend a by-election in the <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i16806">Fosseridge</a> ward of <b>Cotswold</b> district, covering a number of villages to the north and east of Stow-on-the-Wold.  Cotswold council was taken over by the Lib Dems in 2019 following a scandal over the Cotswold Water Park which has been ongoing for some years, but Fosseridge ward has remained firmly in the Conservative column and their candidate David Cunningham should be favoured to hold.  The highest point of the Cotswolds is Cleeve Hill, which is not in the Cotswold district at all: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/1hhhohua">Cleeve Hill</a> gives its name to a ward of <b>Tewkesbury</b> district which wraps around the eastern side of the fast-growing settlement of Bishop's Cleeve north of Cheltenham.  Again, this is safely Conservative and their defending candidate Keja Berliner should be confident of election.

Things are rather different to the west of the Severn in the <b>Forest of Dean</b>.  The Forest's council is run by a coalition of independent and Green councillors, with the main parties in opposition.  <a href="https://tinyurl.com/wuzxsqo">Berry Hill</a> ward, the birthplace of Dennis Potter, returned two independent councillors in 2019 with the Conservatives in second place; Jamie Elsmore has come forward as a new independent candidate, while the Tories have nominated Terry Hale.  Labour are defending a by-election in Cinderford East ward, which was safe for them two years ago; Shaun Stammers leads their defence.

<h2>Avon and Somerset</h2>

<h3>West of England Mayoralty</h3>

It's metro mayor time again as we come to the mayoralty for the Bristol area, generally known as the West of England Mayoralty.  This is voted for by the voters of the city of Bristol and the districts of South Gloucestershire, and Bath and North East Somerset.  North Somerset, on the far side of the Clifton suspension bridge, is not included.

The inaugural election for this position turned in a fragmented result on the first count. The Conservatives' Tim Bowles led with 27% of the vote; Labour candidate Lesley Mansell placed second with 22%; former Lib Dem MP Stephen Williams finished third with 20%; independent candidate John Savage polled 15% and the Green Party 11%.  The Conservatives and Labour went through to the runoff, which Bowles won 52-48.

Tim Bowles is not seeking re-election.  The Conservatives have selected Samuel Williams, who runs a communications consultancy.  The Labour candidate is Dan Norris, who was the MP for Wansdyke from 1997 to 2010.  The Lib Dems have reselected Stephen Williams; not to be confused with the Conservative candidate of a similar name, Stephen was the MP for Bristol West from 2005 to 2015.  John Savage has not returned, so completing the ballot paper is the Green candidate Jerome Thomas, a member of the outgoing Bristol city council.

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

There is a wider electorate for the Avon and Somerset police and crime commissioner, whose remit covers the three boroughs in the West of England mayoralty, the Somerset county council area and the unitary district of North Somerset.  Since 2012 the PCC has been independent figure Sue Mountstevens, who in 2012 was the only police and crime commissioner to receive a vote from more than 10% of their electorate - such was the awful turnout in those comedy elections.  Things were different in 2016, when Mountstevens topped the poll in the first round with just 26% of the vote; Labour polled 24%, the Conservatives 19%, UKIP 9% and three other candidates all saved their deposits with 7% each.  Sue Mountstevens and Labour candidate Kerry Barker went through to the runoff, which Mountstevens won 54-46.

Sue Mountstevens is not seeking re-election, but her deputy John Smith is standing as an independent candidate.  Criminal barrister Kerry Barker tries again for Labour.  The Conservatives have selected Mark Shelford, an Army officer of 32 years' service.  UKIP have not returned, so completing the PCC ballot paper are Heather Shearer for the Lib Dems and Cleo Lake for the Green Party.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

For some reason, <b>Bristol</b> has ended up with three major single-member elected posts.  As well as the Avon and Somerset Police and Crime Commissioner and the Mayor of the West of England, the Mayor of Bristol is up for re-election.  This is currently Labour's Marvin Rees who had a big win here in 2016; on the first count he led with 40% against 23% for the outgoing independent mayor George Ferguson and 14% for the Conservatives, and Rees increased his lead in the runoff to beat Ferguson 63-37 in the final reckoning.

Rees is seeking re-election for a second term.  Ferguson has not returned.  The Conservatives have selected Alastair Watson, a former city councillor (serving as ceremonial Lord Mayor in 2014-15) and businessman.  Also standing are Sandy Hore-Ruthven for the Green Party, Caroline Gooch for the Lib Dems, Tom Baldwin for the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition, independent candidates Sean Donnelly and Oska Shaw, and Reform UK candidate Robert Clarke.

Along with Rees' mayoralty, Labour are defending an overall majority of four seats on Bristol city council.  In 2016 they won 37 seats against 14 Conservatives, 11 Greens and 8 Lib Dems.

There are no local elections this year in Bath and North-East Somerset, North Somerset or South Gloucestershire apart from by-elections.  In <b>South Gloucestershire</b> the suburban Bristol ward of <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i20083">Frenchay and Downend</a> is defended by the Conservatives; this is a safe ward which should return their candidate Liz Brennan.  Things are politically rather different in the <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i16878">Portishead East</a> ward of <b>North Somerset</b>, which voted strongly for the localist Portishead Independents in 2019; their defending candidate is Caroline Goddard.

The scheduled election for Somerset county council has been postponed to 2022 due to the possibility of further local government reorganisation in the county.  As a result there are no local elections within the Somerset county council area apart from two by-elections.  We have already had one recent reorganisation with the formation in 2019 of <b>Somerset West and Taunton</b> council, where there is a by-election to the ward of <a href="https://tinyurl.com/m8fzftc4">Trull, Pitminster and Corfe</a> covering three rural parishes immediately south of Taunton.  This was safely Lib Dem in 2019, and their candidate Dawn Johnson should be favoured to hold.

Things are rather different in the city of Wells, where there is a by-election in the <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i9217">Wells St Thomas'</a> ward of <b>Mendip</b> council.  This was a longstanding Lib Dem-Tory marginal, the Liberal Democrats normally having the better of the results (including in a 2018 by-election, for which see <em>Andrew's Previews</em>, page 380), which went safe Lib Dem in 2019.  The party had selected Wells city councillor Tony Robbins to defend the by-election, but they cocked up his nomination papers and as a result there is no Lib Dem candidate on the ballot.  Accordingly, this Wells St Thomas' by-election is an unexpected free-for-all between the Conservatives' Tanys Pullin and Labour's Adam Fyfe.

<h2>Wiltshire</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

The Wiltshire PCC is Angus Macpherson of the Conservatives, who was re-elected for a second term in 2016 comfortably.  In the first round he had 47% of the vote against 23% for Labour and 16% for the Liberal Democrats; this lead was extended to 64-36 in the runoff.

Macpherson is standing down, and to replace him the Conservatives have selected Wiltshire councillor Jonathan Seed.  The Labour candidate is Swindon councillor Junab Ali.  Standing for the Lib Dems is Liz Webster, who fought North Swindon and The Cotswolds in the 2017 and 2019 general elections respectively.  Also standing are Julian Malins (a former City of London alderman, former Conservative parliamentary candidate, and brother of the former Conservative MP Humfrey Malins) for Reform UK, Brig Oubridge for the Greens and independent candidate Mike Rees.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

There are elections this year for the whole of Wiltshire council and one-third of Swindon council.

The present <b>Wiltshire</b> council dates from 2009 when the county's local government was reorganised and its district councils were abolished.  All three Wiltshire elections to date have returned Conservative majorities, with the party winning 68 seats out of a possible 98 in 2017.  Although new division boundaries make comparisons difficult, there's no real reason to expect a change of control here.

Instead attention within the county will focus on the town of <b>Swindon</b>.  This has a small Conservative majority that rests on a particularly good result in May 2019, when the Tories converted a 39.6-39.2 lead over Labour in votes into a 12-7 win in seats; this seat tally was impressive enough in its own right but was actually an improvement on the 11-8 Tory lead recorded on general election day in 2015.  This year Labour and the Tories are defending nine wards each, plus a Conservative-defended by-election in the safe Chiseldon and Lawn ward, and a par score would be for the Conservatives to increase their majority on the council.

<h2>Dorset</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

The Dorset PCC since 2012 has been Martyn Underhill, a long-serving senior police officer who worked on (among other things) the Sarah Payne child murder investigation.  Underhill was elected in 2012 as an independent candidate, being re-elected in 2016; in the first round he had 38% of the vote to the Conservatives' 29% and UKIP's 17%, and in the runoff he defeated Tory candidate Andrew Graham 60-40.

Underhill is not seeking re-election.  He has endorsed new independent candidate Dan Hardy, a former Grenadier Guardsman and police officer.  David Sidwick, according to his unimprovable Twitter description, is a "husband, dad, boardgame geek, wildlife lover, sci-fi nut, teacake fan, strategic leader and Conservative PCC candidate for Dorset".  UKIP have not returned, so the ballot paper is completed by Patrick Canavan for Labour, Mark Robson for the Lib Dems and Claire Seymour for the Green Party.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

Following the reorganisation of Dorset's local government in 2019, the only local elections in the county this year are two by-elections to <b>Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole</b> council.

BCP council dates from the 2019 reorganisation as a merger of the former unitary districts of Poole and Bournemouth with the non-metropolitan district of Christchurch.  This seems to have gone down very badly in Christchurch in particular: at parliamentary level Christchurch is one of the safest Conservative constituencies, but the Tories were thrashed in most of the town's wards by an independent slate and, largely as a result of that, failed to win a majority on the council.  An anti-Conservative rainbow coalition with a slim majority was set up under the leadership of Lib Dem councillor Vikki Slade.

In April 2020 Colin Bungey, a former mayor of Christchurch and independent councillor for <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i20943">Commons</a> ward (covering northern Christchurch and Bournemouth Airport), died.  Because of the pandemic, no by-election could be held.  The Conservatives promptly launched a confidence motion against Slade, which resulted in a tie and was rejected on the council chairman's casting vote.  Then in July 2020 Pete Parish, Lib Dem councillor for <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i20941">Canford Heath</a> ward in Poole, died.  Because of the pandemic, no by-election could be held.  Another confidence motion was launched against the rainbow coalition, and this time Vikki Slade was ousted and a Conservative council leader installed.

The Conservatives now run a minority administration in BCP with 36 councillors, two short of a majority; if they can gain both of these by-elections they will have half of the seats.  Will they manage that?  Judging from the 2019 results, that seems like a tall order.  The Christchurch Independents had a large majority in Commons ward two years ago, and they have since filed the paperwork with the Electoral Commission to register as a political party and use the name "Christchurch Independents" on the ballot paper.  Their defending candidate is Vanessa Ricketts.  Canford Heath has been a safe Lib Dem area for many years and their candidate Jennie Hodges will be a short-priced favourite.

<h2>Devon and Cornwall</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

The Devon and Cornwall PCC election turned in a close result in 2016.  Top in the first round was Alison Hernandez of the Conservatives with just 24%; Gareth Derrick of Labour was second with 23%; UKIP polled 17%, independent candidate Bob Spencer got 15% and Lib Dem former MP Richard Younger-Ross finished fifth with 12%.  Hernandez and Derrick went through to the runoff, and transfers from the other four candidates were very even which resulted in a Conservative win by 51.1-48.9, a majority of 3,794 votes.

Hernandez is seeking re-election in a reduced field of four candidates.  Labour have reselected Plymouth councillor Gareth Derrick for another go, the Lib Dem candidate this time is former police officer Brian Blake, and the Greens' Stuart Jackson completes the ballot paper.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

There are elections this year for the whole of Devon county council, Cornwall council and the Isles of Scilly council, together with one-third of Exeter and Plymouth councils.

Both the cities of Exeter and Plymouth have Labour majorities.  Labour control <b>Plymouth</b> with 30 seats out of 57; that majority might be in some danger judging solely from the May 2019 results, but the opposition Conservative group have since suffered a major split and probably need to sort their own house out first before challenging for the council leadership.  The Labour majority in <b>Exeter</b> does not look in serious danger.  As Plymouth is a unitary council, Exeter supplies the entire Labour group on <b>Devon county council</b> which has a large and secure-looking Conservative majority.

Things are different over the Tamar in <b>Cornwall</b>, where the Conservatives are the largest party but the administration is a Lib Dem-Independent coalition.  There are major boundary changes in Cornwall with no fewer than 36 seats disappearing, which should shake things up quite a lot.

The tiny <b>Isles of Scilly</b> council is non-partisan.  Sixteen candidates have come forward for the sixteen seats; there will be an election for the 12 seats on St Mary's as 13 candidates are standing there, but there will not be an election for the other four islands in the archipelago.  Harry Legg has been elected unopposed in St Agnes, Tony Tobin-Dougan in St Martin's and Robert Dorrien-Smith in Tresco.  No candidates came forward to represent the island of Bryher, and a by-election will have to be held there in due course - assuming, that is, that one of the locals (and Bryher's population is comfortably under 100) wants to be a councillor.

With all of Cornwall's local government being renewed this year, for local by-elections we have to cross back to Devon.  There have been shenanigans in <b>Mid Devon</b> district over the last year: the Conservatives lost their majority in 2019 and an Independent-Lib Dem-Green administration took over, but following disagreements within the ruling coalition the Lib Dem cabinet ministers were sacked in August 2020 and the Conservatives have taken their place in the administration.  Mid Devon council has three by-elections on 6th May, two of which are in Tiverton; <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i8831">Castle</a> ward, covering the north of the town, returned two Lib Dem gains from the Conservatives in 2019 in a close a three-way marginal result, and the Lib Dems' David Wulff will face competition from the Tories' Elizabeth Slade (who lost her seat here in 2019) and Labour's Richard Cornley.  <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i8849">Westexe</a> ward, covering the west of Tiverton, has returned independent, Conservative, Labour and UKIP councillors this century and voted Conservative in a September 2017 by-election (<em>Andrew's Previews 2017</em>, page 248); in 2019 a full slate of independent councillors was elected, and three independent candidates have come forward for this by-election (Stephen Bush, Claire Hole and Adrian Howell).  If they split the independent vote between them, that could present an opportunity for the Conservatives' Stephen Pugh or the Greens' Rosie Wibberley.  Finally, the Conservatives defend the deeply-rural <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i8844">Taw</a> ward, covering seven parishes on the western side of the Taw valley from Wembworthy to Zeal Monachorum; the Tories were unopposed here in 2019, and their candidate Peter Heal should have little trouble holding the Taw by-election.

In the <b>South Hams</b> district we have an intriguing by-election in the <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i17307">Ivybridge West</a> ward, which returned two Conservatives in 2019 against opposition from a single Labour candidate and a single Lib Dem.  The candidate list this time is the unusual combination of Conservative, Green Party, and Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition; Louise Jones defends for the Tories, while the Green candidate Katie Reville was a strong runner-up here in 2015 but didn't stand in 2019.

There are no local elections this year in <b>Torbay</b> apart from a local by-election in <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y5w3pwt7">Clifton with Maidenway</a> ward, which is located in western Paignton.  Long-time readers of Andrew's Previews will remember a by-election here in November 2015 which was a big win for Adrian Sanders, the former Lib Dem MP for Torbay.  Sanders didn't seek re-election to the council in 2019, but his old ward (on revised boundaries) remained safely Lib Dem, and their new candidate Cat Johns starts as favourite.

Our final Devon by-election takes place east of Exeter in the <b>East Devon</b> district, which was taken over by an independent-led administration after the 2019 election.  One of the wards which voted independent was <a href="https://tinyurl.com/8bsq21vm">Whimple and Rockbeare</a>, a few miles west of Ottery St Mary, but that will change in this by-election as there is no defending independent candidate.  Richard Lawrence of the Conservatives takes on Lib Dem Todd Olive in a straight fight.

<h2>Norfolk</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

The outgoing Norfolk PCC is former Canadian diplomat Lorne Green.  In the 2016 election he was top of the first round with 28%, against 24% for Labour and 17% each for UKIP and the outgoing independent PCC Stephen Bett, who finished fourth in his re-election attempt.  The runoff saw Green beat the Labour candidate by 54-46.

Green is not seeking re-election and the Conservatives have selected the wonderfully-named Giles Orpen-Smellie, an Army veteran of 34 years' service including tours in Northern Ireland, the Falklands, the Gulf War, the Balkans, Sierra Leone and Iraq.  The Labour candidate is Michael Rosen; this Michael Rosen is not the former Children's Laureate and near-casualty of COVID of that name, rather he is the former director of children's services for Norfolk county council.  Also standing are John Crofts for the Lib Dems, independent David Moreland and the Greens' Martin Schmierer.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

There are elections this year for the whole of Norfolk county council and for one-third of Norwich council.

<b>Norfolk county council</b> was hung in the 2013-17 term thanks to a very good UKIP performance in May 2013; this has since unwound and the 2017 election gave the Conservatives 55 seats here against 17 Labour, 11 Lib Dems and one independent.  It's difficult to see that changing, although the Green Party (which was wiped out here in 2017) will want to get back on the council.  The Green powerbase is in <b>Norwich</b>, whose whole council was up in 2019 on slightly-revised ward boundaries; that election gave 27 seats to Labour, 9 to the Greens and 3 to the Lib Dems, and none of the city's 13 wards look marginal so it will take a lot of effort for that seat count to change.

Norfolk's four local by-elections on 6th May are defended by four different parties.  <b>Great Yarmouth</b> council moved off the thirds cycle in 2019, but there are two by-elections here this year: in <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i7269">Claydon</a> ward within the town, and <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i7276">Ormesby</a> ward covering two parishes some distance to the north.  Claydon has voted Labour in every election since 2004 with the exception of a UKIP win in 2014; Labour were well ahead here in 2019 and their candidate Jo Thurtle should be favoured.  Ormesby's independent councillor Steven Scott-Greenard has resigned and the by-election to replace him is a straight fight between the Ron Hanton of the Conservatives (who hold the ward's other seat) and Alison Green of Labour.

Further along the Norfolk coast we come to the <a href="https://tinyurl.com/14r01bgt">Coastal</a> ward of <b>North Norfolk</b> council, based on Cley next the Sea and Blakeney.  This ward was a big win for the Liberal Democrats in May 2019, but their councillor Karen Ward contracted COVID and is yet to regain her health.  The Lib Dem candidate Phil Bailey should be favoured in the Coastal by-election.  In May 2019 Coastal ward was part of a Lib Dem constituency, but the Liberal Democrats failed to defend it in the December 2019 general election; new Conservative MP Duncan Baker has vacated his North Norfolk council seat resulting in a by-election in the ward immediately to the south, Holt ward.  Holt split its two seats between the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats in 2019, but the Lib Dems have failed to find a candidate for the resulting by-election: defending Conservative Eric Vardy will instead take on Labour's Jasper Haywood and two independents, Nick Coppack (a former Conservative North Norfolk councillor) and Jono Read (digital editor of the <em>New European</em> newspaper).

<h2>Suffolk</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

In the 2016 Suffolk easily re-elected the Conservatives' Tim Passmore as its police and crime commissioner.  On the first count Passmore had a big lead with 44% of the vote, against 25% for Labour and 17% for UKIP; his lead in the run-off against Labour was 62-38.

Passmore is seeking re-election for a third term.  The Labour candidate this time is Elizabeth Hughes, an Ipswich councillor who fought safe-Conservative Suffolk constituencies at the 2017 and 2019 general elections.  UKIP have not returned, so completing the ballot paper are Andy Patmore for the Green Party and James Sandbach for the Liberal Democrats.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

There are elections this year for the whole of Suffolk county council and for one-third of Ipswich council.

Unlike its northern neighbour, <b>Suffolk county council</b> narrowly re-elected its Conservative administration in 2013 with a 39-36 lead over the opposition; however, by 2017 that Tory majority had disappeared in a series of poor by-election results.  The 2017 election marked a return to form for the Tories with 52 seats, against 11 Labour, 5 Lib Dems, 4 independents and 3 Greens.  Local elections in the county two years ago were not that promising for the Conservatives, who lost control of Babergh and Mid Suffolk districts and performed particularly poorly in the rural west of the county (the constituency of the health secretary Matt Hancock, although that underperformance probably wasn't his fault).  Despite that, there should be enough headroom for the Conservative administration to continue.

A lot of that underperformance in western Suffolk was a large independent vote resulting from the abolition of the former Forest Heath council, based on Newmarket and Mildenhall, whose area is now administered by <b>West Suffolk</b> council from Bury St Edmunds.  Independent candidates did very well in the old Forest Heath area, as can be seen from the result in <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i21068">Lakenheath</a> ward where independent David Gathercole, the only opposition to a two-man Conservative slate, topped the poll.  This ward includes the RAF Lakenheath airbase occupied by the US Air Force; very few if any of the Americans here will have the right to vote, so Lakenheath ward shouldn't suffer the turnout problems seen in other military-dominated wards.  Two independent candidates - David Chandler and Gerald Kelly - will try to take over the late David Gathercole's seat, while Colin Noble will seek to gain for the Conservatives.

That's just one of six local by-elections to West Suffolk council, the most for any council on 6th May.  Two of these are in sprawling wards covering villages between Bury St Edmunds and Haverhill.  <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i21088">Whepstead and Wickhambrook</a> ward had a big Tory lead in May 2019 and their candidate Sarah Pugh should have few problems.  <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i21055">Clare, Hundon and Kedington</a> ward returned two Tories and an independent in 2019, but this by-election is a straight fight between the Conservatives' Nick Clarke and Kerry Rogers for Labour, who didn't stand here last time.

That leaves three local by-elections in Bury St Edmunds.  Beyond the A14 on the eastern edge of the city lies <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i21074">Moreton Hall</a> ward, which extends outside the city boundary to take in Rougham Airfield.  Local elections here are dominated by independent councillor Trevor Beckwith; he topped the poll in 2019, with the other two seats going to independent Frank Warby and a Conservative.  The by-election here is in respect of Warby, who had joined the Conservatives before resigning from the council; his replacement is likely to be a contest between independent Barry Thomas and Conservative Birgitte Mager.  The Tories will also be looking to gain the city-centre <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i21047">Abbeygate</a> ward, which returned one councillor each for the Greens and Conservatives in 2019; the Greens' Julia Wakeham will be looking to hold against the Tories' Nick Wiseman.  Finally, Bury St Edmunds' <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i21082">Southgate</a> ward was safe Conservative last time and should be an easy hold for their candidate Sarah Stamp.

Another new council created in 2019 was <b>East Suffolk</b> district, which stretches along the littoral from Felixstowe to Lowestoft.  The Green Party will fancy their chances in both East Suffolk by-elections today.  <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i21026">Framlingham</a>, a tiny market town about 16 miles north-east of Ipswich, is the location of the "castle on the hill" in that song by Ed Sheeran who is an elector here; Framlingham Castle is notable in its own right as the place where Mary Tudor was proclaimed Queen in 1553.  The Conservatives won both seats here at the first East Suffolk council elections in 2019 with the Greens close behind; defending Tory candidate Lydia Freeman will be challenged this time by Green Party nominee Beth Keys-Holloway.  The Greens have turned the Broads town of Beccles into a stronghold at local level, and Sarah Plummer should have little trouble defending the <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i21019">Beccles and Worlingham</a> by-election.

Beccles lies on the northern boundary of Suffolk, while the Sudbury suburb of <a href="https://tinyurl.com/mmvhbd6j">Great Cornard</a> lies on the county's southern boundary.  This is one of the strongest Labour areas within the <b>Babergh</b> district of southern Suffolk, although the Conservatives still won all three seats here in 2019.  Simon Barrett is the defending Conservative candidate in the Great Cornard by-election, Jake Thomas will hope to gain for Labour.

Despite having a Tory MP since December 2019, <b>Ipswich</b> council has a large Labour majority which looks in no serious danger, although a repeat of the May 2019 results would see Labour lose two seats.

<h2>Cambridgeshire</h2>

<h3>Mayor of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough</h3>

The most rural of the metro mayoralties set up to date is that for Cambridgeshire and Peterborough, which covers an area which is fast growing in population but still has a lot of green space (although quite a lot of that is fenland).  The inaugural mayoral election in 2017 saw the Tories' James Palmer lead in the first round with 38%, with 23% for the Lib Dems and 19% for Labour.  Palmer and the Lib Dem candidate Rod Cantrill went through to the runoff, which Palmer won by the easy margin of 57-43.

Palmer is seeking re-election for a second term as mayor.  The Lib Dems have selected Aidan van de Weyer, the deputy leader of South Cambridgeshire council.  Completing the mayoral ballot paper is Labour candidate Nik Johnson, an NHS consultant paediatrician and Huntingdonshire councillor.

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

A year earlier, the Cambridgeshire PCC election (which covers the same area) had a rather different result.  Conservative PCC Jason Ablewhite was re-elected for a second term, polling 36% in the first round against 31% for Labour and 17% for UKIP; on this occasion the run-off was Tory versus Labour, with Ablewhite prevailing by the narrower margin of 53-47.  Ablewhite resigned as PCC in November 2019 under something of a cloud, and his deputy has been acting in the role since then.

For this election the Conservatives have changed candidate to Darryl Preston, a former police officer now working for the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners.  Labour have selected Cambridge city councillor Nicky Massey.  UKIP have not returned, so completing the PCC ballot paper are Susan Morris for Reform UK and Rupert Moss-Eccardt for the Liberal Democrats.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

There are elections this year for the whole of Cambridgeshire county council, for the whole of Cambridge city council on new ward boundaries, and for one-third of Peterborough council.

<b>Cambridgeshire county council</b> was a Conservative gain in 2017, with new division boundaries helping the party to 36 seats against 15 Lib Dems, 7 Labour councillors and 3 independents.   The Tories have since performed very badly in the south of the county: the Lib Dems won a majority in South Cambridgeshire district in 2018, weren't far off winning control of East Cambridgeshire in May 2019 and weren't far off taking the South Cambridgeshire parliamentary seat in December 2019.  Some of these trends were already evident in May 2017 (six of the 15 Lib Dem wins that year were in South Cambridgeshire district) so we shouldn't overstate the chance of major seat changes, but the Tories must be looking at their majority on the county council with some concern.

<b>Peterborough</b> council is currently hung, with a minority Conservative administration on 28 out of 60 seats (two of which are vacant) supported by the 3 Werrington localist councillors.  A repeat of the May 2019 results would see the Conservatives lose three further seats and could result in Labour challenging for the council leadership.  Mind, Peterborough is a city that had three different MPs in 2019, which shows a volatile local political scene firmly in keeping with the volatile events of that year.  It would take a brave person to predict what will happen here.

Outside Peterborough we have a by-election to <b>Fenland</b> council from <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i17097">Lattersey</a> ward, covering the south-east corner of Whittlesey around Whittlesea station.  (When it comes to spelling, there's the right way, the wrong way and the railway.)  The Conservatives won this ward unopposed in 2015 - Fenland district is like that - and had a 2-1 margin over Labour in 2019 so the defending Tory candidate Jason Mockett can be confident of his election chances.

Peterborough was once linked with the former county of <b>Huntingdonshire</b>, which is now a district under Cambridgeshire county council and sees four by-elections on 6 May.  I mentioned earlier that the Police and Crime Commissioner Jason Ablewhite had resigned in November 2019; he had also resigned as a Huntingdonshire councillor, and a by-election was sneaked in during the winter of 2019-20 which resulted in a Conservative hold in the East ward of the town of St Ives.  The other <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i19344">St Ives East</a> councillor has now resigned, and the Conservatives should hold this seat with their candidate Craig Smith.  The Tories also defend by-elections in <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i19345">St Ives South</a> ward and in the <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i19355">Warboys</a> ward in the fens between Huntingdon and Ramsey (with Rianna d'Souza and Michael Haines as the defending candidates), and might fancy their chances in the Labour-held ward of <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i19341">Huntingdon North</a> (covering most of Huntingdon town), although Labour's candidate Marion Kadewere is defending a large enough majority from the last Huntingdonshire elections in 2018.

Finally, Labour are firmly in control of <b>Cambridge</b> city council, where all 42 seats are up for election this year on slightly-revised ward boundaries.

<h2>Essex</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

The 2016 Essex PCC election was open following the retirement of Tory PCC Nick Alston.  New Conservative candidate Roger Hirst topped the poll in the first round with 33% of the vote, against 24% for former Conservative MP Bob Spink standing as the UKIP candidate, 20% for Labour and 13% for "Zero Tolerance Policing Ex Chief" Martin Terry.  Hirst and Spink went through to the runoff, with Hirst winning comfortably by 57-43.

Roger Hirst is seeking re-election for a second term, and this time he won't have to face a UKIP candidate or Martin Terry.  Labour have re-selected their 2016 candidate Chris Vince, a Harlow councillor and maths teacher.  Also standing are Jon Whitehouse for the Lib Dems and Robin Tilbrook for the English Democrats.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

There are elections this year for the whole of Essex county council and for one-third of Basildon, Brentwood, Castle Point, Colchester, Epping Forest, Harlow, Rochford, Southend-on-Sea and Thurrock councils.

<b>Essex county council</b> is one of the safest county councils for the Conservatives.  The 2017 election returned 56 Conservative councillors against 7 Lib Dems, 6 Labour, 3 localists (2 from Canvey Island, the other from Loughton), 2 independents and a Green.

Instead attention within the county should focus on the districts and boroughs.  To start with England's oldest town, <b>Colchester</b> council is currently hung; the Conservatives are the largest party with 23 seats (including one vacancy) out of 51, but the administration is a coalition of the Lib Dems, Labour and an independent group which has a lock on Highwoods ward.  A repeat of the 2019 results would see that coalition increase its majority, with Stanway ward falling to the Lib Dems.

Moving to the towns on the north side of the Thames estuary, a similar rainbow coalition controls <b>Southend-on-Sea</b> council where the Conservatives are the currently the largest party on 20 seats out of 51.  The Tories did very poorly here in May 2019, carrying only four of the borough's 17 wards; they are defending eight seats this year so there is the potential for some large changes on this council.

<b>Rochford</b> council, based on Rayleigh and the rural area to the north of Southend, has a strong Conservative majority which can be expected to increase.  <b>Castle Point</b> council is stuck in a rut, with the Conservatives holding all the wards on the mainland in Benfleet and an independent group dominating offshore on Canvey Island; because Benfleet has more councillors than Canvey, this means a small but very stable Conservative majority.  The Castle Point returning officer has taken the unusual step of filling the casual vacancies in Boyce and St George's wards (on the mainland) with separate elections rather than combining them into a double vacancy election like every other RO does, so if you are voting in those wards you will receive two ballot papers for the district council election (plus one for the county council and one for the PCC).

Billericay and Wickford are covered by the large <b>Basildon</b> council where the Tories lost control in 2019; Labour and a number of independent groups are now running the show.  In 2016 Basildon returned three UKIP councillors, none of whom are still in the party; their respective wards returned one Conservative, one Labour and one independent councillor in 2019, so the Tories probably can't rely on a UKIP unwind here.

The UKIP factor was much larger in <b>Thurrock</b> in 2016.  The Kippers topped the poll across the 17 wards up for election that year with 39% of the vote, and won 6 wards; Labour polled 32% and won 4 wards, and the Conservatives won 7 wards despite coming in third in votes with just 28%.  Isn't England's first-past-the-post system wonderful?  A number of those UKIP councillors (after a "Thurrock Independents" interlude) have ended up in the Conservative group since the 2019 election, which has resulted in the Tories gaining, albeit by defection, a majority on Thurrock council for the first time since 2007.  Judging from the 2019 results, that majority could well be endorsed by the electorate this time round.

<b>Brentwood</b> has a rather small Conservative majority - 20 seats out of 37 - following a good Lib Dem performance in 2019, but the scope for further Conservative losses is limited as they are only defending six wards this year.  The Conservative majority in <b>Epping Forest</b> looks safe, as does the Labour majority in <b>Harlow</b> where the Tories have yet to make their dominance at parliamentary and county council level stick.  Harlow council currently has a 20-13 lead for Labour, who are defending 7 wards this year to the Conservatives' 4.

The standalone by-elections (other than the ones in Castle Point already mentioned) are an interesting bunch.  We start in the county town of <b>Chelmsford</b> where the Lib Dems defend <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i3810">Moulsham Lodge</a> ward, in the south of the city proper; although the Tories won one of the two seats in 2015, this was safely Lib Dem in 2019 and the defending candidate is Hazel Clark.

To the east of Chelmsford is the deeply rural and very small <b>Maldon</b> district, which returned a tiny Conservative majority of 16-15 over independent councillors in 2019.  That majority has since fallen apart thanks to a damaging split in the Tory group, and the independents took over the council leadership in November last year.  Things could get worse for the Maldon Conservatives if they fail to defend the by-elections in <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i3896">Heybridge East</a> ward (immediately north-east of Maldon, and including a large swathe of saltmarsh in the Blackwater estuary) or <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i3906">Tollesbury</a> ward (a remote village in the marshes which returned a Labour councillor in a 2012 by-election, but was safe Conservative in 2019).  The defending Conservative candidates are Bruce Heubner in Heybridge East and Debbie Keating in Tollesbury.

<b>Uttlesford</b> district, covering a large rural area in the north-west of Essex, was one of the councils where the Conservatives lost control in 2019: the ruling Residents for Uttlesford party has a large majority on the council which is not in danger even though they are defending two by-elections: in <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i16917">The Sampfords</a> ward, covering five parishes east of Saffron Walden which was a Residents gain in 2019 on a big swing, and in <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i16908">Newport</a> ward on the railway line from Stansted to Cambridge which R4U have held since 2015.  On the other hand, the R4U councillor who vacated Newport had jumped to the Greens before leaving the council, so some debate can be had about whether the defending candidate there is Judy Emanuel for the Residents or Edward Gildea for the Greens.  The Residents have nominated Uli Gerhard to hold the by-election in The Sampfords.

The Green Party have had a presence for some time in the <b>Braintree</b> district, but the two wards holding elections there on 6 May were both safely Conservative in 2019.  These are <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i16614">Witham South</a> ward, defended for the Tories by William Korsinah; and <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i16603">Hatfield Peverel and Terling</a> ward, a rural area to the west of Witham town, where the Conservatives have nominated Darren White.

Saving the best till last, we come to the <b>Tendring</b> district which covers everything in Essex east of Colchester, including the town of Clacton-on-Sea which, seven long years ago, was the first constituency to elect a UKIP member of parliament.  UKIP won a large number of seats on Tendring council at the following elections in May 2015; despite the inevitable split and a seventh-place finish in the 2019 elections, the Kippers did still hold on to five council seats here in May 2019.  One of those was in the <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i19792">West Clacton and Jaywick Sands</a> ward, based on the village of Jaywick.

When your own council leader describes your village as "an embarrassment to the whole country", <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/features/edge-nowhere-7924708.html">as then Tendring leader Neil Stock said in 2012</a>, you know you've got problems.  Notorious for consistently being right at the bottom of the English indices of multiple deprivation, worse-off than anywhere in inner-city London or Manchester, Jaywick started off in the late 1920s as summer holiday homes for East Enders, and is now occupied year-round with increasingly dilapidated housing stock, mostly unadopted roads, a serious coastal flooding risk and intractable economic problems following the closure of the nearby Clacton Butlins camp in the 1980s.  Despite this, there is clearly a community spirit in the village: Jaywick residents successfully fought off an attempt by the local council to bulldoze the place in 1970, and the use of the village in an attack ad by a 2018 US congressional Republican candidate resulted in uproar here and a climbdown from the candidate concerned.  Those who would sneer at people who live in UKIP-voting areas (of whom your columnist is one) would do well to put those sneers away.

And a UKIP-voting area this is: West Clacton and Jaywick Sands ward elected an independent (easily) and a UKIP candidate (narrowly) as its two councillors in 2019.  The UKIP councillor has resigned and the party is not defending the resulting by-election giving us a free-for-all.  Andy White, who was the runner-up here in 2019 as an independent candidate, has returned for another go and this time he has the nomination of the localist group Tendring First; two other independents are standing (Brad Thompson and Andy Wood), while the ruling minority Conservative group on the council have nominated Jayne Nash for this by-election.

The Tories may have better chances in the other Tendring by-election, at the other end of Clacton-on-Sea.  <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i19772">Eastcliff</a> ward was close in 2019 between the localist group "Holland-on-Sea and Eastcliff Matters" and the second-placed Conservatives.  The localists have nominated Rick Speller to hold the Eastcliff by-election, while former Tory councillor Mick Skeels senior will seek to make a comeback.

<h2>Hertfordshire</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

The Hertfordshire PCC since 2012 has been David Lloyd of the Conservatives.  He was re-elected in 2016, polling 42% against 27% for former Labour MP Kerry Pollard and 16% for the Lib Dems.  Lloyd's lead over Pollard in the final reckoning was 59-41.

The 2021 PCC election will feature only those three parties.  The Conservatives' Lloyd is seeking a third term, and is opposed by Labour's Philip Ross (a cybersecurity consultant) and the Lib Dems' Sam North (a North Hertfordshire councillor and former police officer).

<h3>Local elections</h3>

There are elections this year for the whole of Hertfordshire county council and for one-third of Broxbourne, North Hertfordshire, St Albans, Stevenage, Three Rivers, Watford and Welwyn Hatfield councils.

The only of those which looks completely safe for the Tories is <b>Broxbourne</b>, based on the towns of Cheshunt and Hoddesdon in the Lea Valley.  The A1/East Coast Main Line corridor is another matter entirely.  The Conservatives lost their majority on <b>Welwyn Hatfield</b> council in 2019, but still run the district as a minority with 23 seats against 13 Labour and 12 Lib Dem councillors.  If the 2019 election is repeated the Tories would lose three of the ten wards they are defending and fall further from overall control.  Similar considerations apply in the <b>North Hertfordshire</b> district, which is based on Hitchin, Letchworth and Royston; however, here the 22-strong Conservative group is in opposition to a coalition of Labour (16) and the Lib Dems (11).  <b>Stevenage</b> council has had a Labour majority continuously since the 1974 reorganisation and that will not change this year.

Following a Tory bloodbath in 2019 <b>St Albans</b> council is tied, with the Conservatives and Lib Dems both on 24 seats; the balance of power is held by 5 Labour councillors, 4 independents and a single Green councillor.  Since then the Lib Dems have gained the St Albans parliamentary seat after decades of trying.  A repeat of the May 2019 results would result in four Lib Dem gains (mostly from the small parties), which would make their present minority administration more secure.  The Liberal Democrats are more firmly in control of <b>Watford</b> (where they hold the elected mayoralty) and the <b>Three Rivers</b> district which wraps around the western side of Watford.

<b>Hertfordshire county council</b> has a large Conservative majority at present (51 councillors against 18 Lib Dems and 9 Labour), but there are enough marginal divisions for this majority to be in some real danger if the poor Conservative performance in 2019 is repeated two years down the line.

There are three standalone by-elections at opposite ends of the county.  In <b>East Hertfordshire</b> district the Lib Dems have the task of defending <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i3110">Bishop's Stortford All Saints</a> ward, covering the east of the town on the road towards the motorway and Stansted Airport; this ward has seesawed between the Tories and Lib Dems over the last couple of decades, but the Liberal Democrat win in 2019 was by a big enough margin that their defending candidate Richard Townsend should be favoured.  The Liberal Democrats also performed well in the 2019 elections to <b>Dacorum</b> council at the western end of Hertfordshire, making the <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i3105">Tring Central</a> ward safe; Sheron Wilkie is their defending candidate there.  The Dacorum district is based on the new town of Hemel Hempstead, which also hosts a by-election in <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i3102">Leverstock Green</a> ward on the eastern edge of the town; this ward was safe Conservative in 2019 and their defence is led by Neil Harden.

<h2>Bedfordshire</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

In the 2016 police and crime commissioner elections Bedfordshire was the only police area which the Conservatives gained from Labour, whose win in 2012 had been rather surprising.  Former TV presenter and journalist Kathryn Holloway topped the poll in the first round with 37% against 35% for outgoing Labour PCC Olly Martins and 12% for the Lib Dems; in the runoff Holloway won by 51.6-48.4, a majority of 2,883 votes.

Holloway is standing down after one term, and the Conservatives have selected Festus Akinbusoye, who runs a security business and briefly served as a special constable before his nomination papers went in.  Akinbusoye was the Conservative candidate for West Ham in the 2015 general election.  Labour have selected David Michael, who has 30 years' service as a Metropolitan Police officer under his belt.  Akinbusoye and Michael are both black, and the Lib Dems make it a trio of BAME candidates from the major parties - not something you see very often in a shire county election - with their nomination of Jas Parmar, a postmaster and former police officer.  Also standing are independent Patrick Hamill and the English Democrats' Antonio Vitiello.

The only local elections this year in Bedfordshire are two by-elections to <b>Luton</b> council.  <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i1448">High Town</a> ward, immediately to the north of the town centre, has been vacated by the new Luton South MP Rachel Hopkins; as described in <em>Andrew's Previews 2016</em>, page 106, this is a safe Labour ward and their candidate Umme Ali shouldn't have much trouble holding it.  The neighbouring <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i1454">Round Green</a> ward is a very different matter, having returned candidates from all three main parties in the last two elections; the 2019 poll returned two Labour councillors and one Lib Dem, and this by-election promises to be closely fought between the defending Labour candidate Fatima Begum and the Lib Dem challenger Steve Moore.

There are no local elections this year to Bedford or Central Bedfordshire councils.

<h2>Thames Valley</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

The Thames Valley is one of the largest of England's police areas, covering the counties of Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire to the north-west of London.  The PCC since 2012 has been Anthony Stansfeld, a Falklands veteran and Conservative representative.  In the 2016 PCC election Stansfeld led in the first round with 40% against 33% for Labour and 15% for the Lib Dems, winning the run-off over Labour by the relatively small margin of 54-46.

Stansfeld is standing down and the Conservatives have selected Matthew Barber, who is a former leader of Vale of White Horse council in Oxfordshire and presently serves as Stansfeld's deputy PCC.  The Labour candidate is Laetisia Carter, a West Oxfordshire councillor and mental health practitioner.  The Lib Dems have selected Oxfordshire county councillor John Howson, and completing a ballot paper of four Oxfordshire-based candidates is independent Alan Robinson.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

There are elections this year for the whole of Oxfordshire county council, the whole of the new Buckinghamshire council, the whole of Oxford council on new ward boundaries, and for one-third of Cherwell, Milton Keynes, Reading, Slough, West Oxfordshire and Wokingham councils.

To start in <b>Buckinghamshire</b>, which holds its first local elections since May 2017 following a reorganisation of the county's local government.  The new council has carried over the electoral divisions from the old Buckinghamshire county council, which four years ago returned 41 Conservative councillors against an opposition of four Lib Dems (all from Aylesbury), three independents and a single Labour councillor.  The new unitary council will be three times the size of the old county council, so for a par score those numbers should be scaled up accordingly.

The other Buckinghamshire local authority is for the New City of <b>Milton Keynes</b>, whose council is very politically balanced; the ruling minority Labour group has 22 seats (one of which is vacant) against 19 Conservatives (including two vacant seats), 15 Lib Dems and an independent.  The Conservatives lost five seats here in May 2019, which doesn't look good at first slight but that actually outperformed expectations given that they were defending ten marginal wards; the ward map this year is much more friendly to the Tories, and a repeat of the 2019 results would see them gain three seats from Labour and become the largest party.

The Conservatives did pretty poorly in the 2019 Oxfordshire council elections, but that underperformance was concentrated in the districts south of Oxford.  The Tory vote generally held up better in <b>Cherwell</b> district, based on Banbury and the fast-growing town of Bicester; a repeat of the 2019 results for Cherwell council would see them lose one seat in Bicester and two seats in the Oxford satellite town of Kidlington, but that won't significantly threaten the Conservative majority on the council.  Similar considerations apply in <b>West Oxfordshire</b> district, where the Conservatives are defending four wards (mostly in Witney town) which voted for the opposition in 2019; however they will have to do worse than that for the district to fall into No Overall Control.

There has been no Conservative local government presence for many years in the city of <b>Oxford</b>, where the whole council is up for election this year on revised ward boundaries.  Oxford is, of course, more than just dreaming spires; there's a significant technological and manufacturing base to the city's economy, and that produces a safe Labour council.

That Tory underperformance in Oxford cost them a majority on <b>Oxfordshire county council</b> in both 2013 and 2017, the latter election resulting in 31 Conservative councillors against 14 Labour, 13 Lib Dems, 4 independents and a localist from Henley-on-Thames.  The Conservatives rely on three of the independent councillors for control of the county.  It will be interesting to see whether the party's poor May 2019 performances in the Vale of White Horse (Abingdon and Wantage) and South Oxfordshire districts are repeated, particularly with the Lib Dems and Greens in South Oxfordshire having apparently renewed their electoral pact.

Those two districts also see three local by-elections.  One of these is in the home of the Williams Formula 1 team, the village of Grove which can found immediately north of Wantage in the <b>Vale of White Horse</b> district.  <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i17076">Grove North</a> was a ward gained by the Lib Dems in their takeover of that council in 2019, and Lib Dem candidate Andy Przybysz will look to defend a seat which should be safe for them now.

Further up the Great Western main line is the boom town of Didcot, within the <b>South Oxfordshire</b> district.  In the town's <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i17050">North East</a> ward a Tory slate was cleared out in 2019 and replaced by two Lib Dems and independent Simon Hewerdine; Hewerdine has resigned and his seat is open with no independent candidate contesting the resulting by-election.  Paul Giesberg contests for the Lib Dems, while the Tories' Andrea Warren will hope to gain a seat back.

At the other end of South Oxfordshire district we come to the third contest Andrew's Previews has covered between the Tories' John Walsh (an accountant with Oxford University Press) and the Lib Dems' Tim Bearder (a former BBC journalist and son of the former Lib Dem MEP Catherine Bearder).  Walsh and Bearder have previously faced off within this column in a 2013 by-election for the North ward of Oxford city council (which Labour won) and in a 2018 by-election for the Wheatley division of Oxfordshire county council (which Bearder won; <em>Andrew's Previews 2018</em>, page 420).  With Bearder holding a 1-0 lead in the series, round 3 will take place immediately to the east of Oxford in the <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i17053">Forest Hill and Holton</a> ward of South Oxfordshire.  Walsh lost his district council seat here to the Lib Dems rather soundly in 2019, and following the withdrawal of Labour this by-election is a straight Lib Dem-Tory fight.

Berkshire county council disappeared in the 1990s, but three of its former districts are holding elections.  In the county town of <b>Reading</b>, where boundary changes have been deferred until next year, Labour have a strong majority on the council and got a rare swing in their favour in the Reading East constituency at the 2019 general election.  The Reading East constituency includes a large amount of territory which is part of the town's urban area but administered separately as part of the <b>Wokingham</b> district; this is a council where the ruling Conservatives have been underperforming throughout the last electoral cycle, and a repeat of the 2019 results would see the Lib Dems gain five seats here and wipe out the Tory majority.  Finally, the Labour majority on <b>Slough</b> council is in no danger whatsoever.

There are no local elections this year in Bracknell Forest, West Berkshire or Windsor and Maidenhead.

<h2>Hampshire</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

Hampshire's police and crime commissioner elections have been unusually interesting, with the inaugural contest in 2012 won by independent candidate Simon Hayes who defeated former Conservative MP Michael Mates.  For the 2016 election the Tories changed candidate to Michael Lane, whose 29% of the vote was enough for a big lead in the first round.  A four-way pileup for the other place in the runoff was won by Labour candidate Robin Price on 16%, ahead of outgoing independent PCC Hayes who finished third with 15%; close behind were the Lib Dems and UKIP on 14% each.  The runoff between Lane and Price resulted in an easy Conservative gain with a 64-36 margin.

Lane is not seeking re-election, and the Conservatives have selected former Portsmouth council leader Donna Jones.  The Labour candidate is Tony Bunday, who is fighting his first election campaign, runs an events company and is a former social worker.  The Lib Dems have selected Richard Murphy, a businessman from Winchester, and completing the ballot paper is Steve James-Bailey for a new party called the Hampshire Independents.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

There are elections this year for the whole of Hampshire county council and the Isle of Wight council, for the whole of Basingstoke and Deane council on new ward boundaries, for one-half of Fareham and Gosport councils, and for one-third of Eastleigh, Hart, Havant, Portsmouth, Rushmoor, Southampton and Winchester councils.

To take the big one first, <b>Hampshire county council</b> has a long-standing and strong Conservative majority, the 2017 election returning 56 Conservative councillors against 19 Lib Dems, 2 Labour councillors (both from Basingstoke) and one councillor from the Community Campaign in Hart district, of which more later.

The 2017 election also saw the Tories gain overall control of the <b>Isle of Wight</b> council after four years of independent-led administration.  Wight returned 25 Conservative councillors, 11 independents, 2 Lib Dems and one councillor each from Labour and the Greens.  There have been no local elections on the Isle of Wight since then.  The Labour slate for this year's Wight council election includes a former MP: Sarah McCarthy-Fry, who represented Portsmouth North in the 2005-10 parliament, is standing for the party in the Conservative-held Lake South division.

The districts which face Wight across the Solent are an interesting bunch.  To start at the eastern end, <b>Havant</b> council was a rare bright spot for the Conservatives in the May 2019 elections: the party was defending every seat up for election that year, and did so successfully.  The Tory majority there is under no danger.  Things were different over the water in the city of <b>Portsmouth</b> which was taken over by a minority Lib Dem administration; the most recent breakdown has 17 Lib Dems, 15 Conservatives, 6 Labour and 4 others (all of whom were elected on one of the above tickets).  A repeat of the 2019 results would see the Lib Dems lose some ground: they are defending Eastney/Craneswater ward which voted Conservative in 2019, and St Jude ward which voted Labour in 2019.  The Tories will also have their eye on the Labour seat in the volatile estates of Paulsgrove ward.

Over the water again, the Tories are defending a majority of two seats on <b>Gosport</b> council.  This has bizarre voting patterns: in the 2019 election the Conservatives polled 52% of the vote across the district to the Lib Dems' 23%, but the Tories and Lib Dems won eight wards each.  A repeat of those results would result in two Conservative losses and No Overall Control.  To reach the rest of the country from Gosport you have to pass through <b>Fareham</b> district, whose Conservative majority is under no danger.  The Lib Dem majority on the neighbouring <b>Eastleigh</b> council is even more impregnable.  The only Labour-controlled local authority in Hampshire is <b>Southampton</b> city council, where Labour have a 30-18 majority over the Conservatives; a repeat of the May 2019 results would see the Conservatives gain three seats nett.

Moving to the M3 corridor of inland Hampshire, the Tories performed very poorly in 2019 in <b>Winchester</b> district which now has a Lib Dem majority.  Although the district does include a large rural area around the city, the Winchester Conservatives will be doing well if they can stem further losses.  All the seats on the <b>Basingstoke and Deane</b> council are up for election on new ward boundaries; this district is currently hung, with 28 Conservatives forming a minority administration against 13 Labour councillors, 10 independents (a number of whom have split from Labour) and 7 Lib Dems.  <b>Hart</b> district (based on Fleet and Yateley) is run by a coalition of the Liberal Democrats and the aforementioned Community Campaign, and that coalition's majority is in no danger.  The Conservatives will remain in control of <b>Rushmoor</b> district, based on the aerospace and military towns of Aldershot and Farnborough.

Most Hampshire districts hold elections by thirds, but there are also five local by-elections to discuss.  Three of these are in the <b>Test Valley</b> district, which runs all the way from Andover to the edge of Southampton.  The edge-of-Southampton ward is called <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i20019">Chilworth, Nursling and Rownhams</a> and represents some closure for your columnist, because I previewed a by-election here on 19th March 2020 which was called off at the last moment due to COVID.  That by-election was to replace the late councillor Nigel Anderdon; since then a second councillor for the ward, Alison Finlay, has also died.  Both of them were Conservative councillors for a safe ward.  This double by-election is a straight fight between the Conservatives and Lib Dems; on the defending Conservative slate, Terese Swain returns from the aborted 2020 by-election and is joined by Mike Maltby.

The other two by-elections to Test Valley council are in Andover, where a localist slate called the Andover Alliance won seven seats in 2019 and appears to have since fallen apart in Handforthesque scenes.  Both these by-elections will be free-for-alls as the Andover Alliance are not defending them.  <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i20012">Andover St Mary's</a> is a contest between the three main parties, with the Tories' Jan Budzynski possibly favourite although Nigel Long, who polled decently as an independent in 2019, is back for another go and now has the Lib Dem nomination.  In <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i20010">Andover Millway</a>, which was very close between the Conservatives and Andover Alliance in 2019, the localist torch has been taken up by Susana Ecclestone of the breakaway Andover Independents, while Jim Neal will seek to gain for the Conservatives.

Finally, we come to the two by-elections in <b>East Hampshire</b> district, both of which are in wards on the boundary with Surrey.  <a href="https://tinyurl.com/ywr9pj7b">Grayshott</a> is essentially an extension of the Surrey village of Hindhead, while the large village of Liphook on the London-Portsmouth railway line anchors the Bramshott and Liphook ward.  These are very safe Conservative wards and should be easily defended by Nick Sear (Bramshott and Liphook) and Tom Hanrahan (Grayshott) respectively.

<h2>Surrey</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

If you thought the Conservatives could never lose a county-wide election in true-blue Surrey, think again.  It happened as recently as November 2012, when the first Surrey police and crime commissioner election was won by "Zero Tolerance Policing Ex Chief" candidate Kevin Hurley.  For the 2016 election the Conservatives got their act together, and their Surrey PCC candidate David Munro led in the first round with 35% against 18% for Hurley, 13% for the Lib Dems and 12% for Labour.  Munro and Hurley went through to the runoff which Munro won by the wide margin of 63-37.

For the 2021 election the Conservatives have deselected David Munro in favour of Lisa Townsend.  Munro has not taken this well, and is seeking re-election as an independent.  Zero Tolerance Policing Ex Chief Kevin Hurley is also trying to get his old job back.  The Lib Dems have selected Mole Valley councillor Paul Kennedy, and train driver and Labour candidate Howard Kaye completes a five-strong ballot paper.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

There are elections this year for the whole of Surrey county council and for one-third of Elmbridge, Mole Valley, Reigate and Banstead, Runnymede, Tandridge and Woking councils.

The 2019 local elections were generally horrific for the Tories in Surrey, with the party losing more than 100 councillors across the county - 60 of them in Guildford and Waverley districts alone.  In <b>Guildford</b> the Conservatives have a chance to recover from that with three local by-elections.  They are defending the Army-dominated <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i4462">Pirbright</a> ward, which was the safest Tory ward in the district in 2019 but where the previous Tory councillor, Gordon Jackson, had gone independent before resigning from the council; Keith Witham is the defending candidate.  <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i4455">Friary and St Nicolas</a> ward, covering Guildford town centre, was safe Lib Dem in 2019 and is defended by their candidate Cait Taylor.  <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i4463">Send</a> ward, between Guildford and Woking, has been held since 2015 by the Guildford Greenbelt Group and gave that party 71% of the vote in 2019; Guida Esteves is their defending candidate.

There are two other standalone by-elections in Surrey to mention.  One of these arises out of the death in January 2020, at the horribly young age of 33, of a luckless man called Sam Kay.  Readers may remember a controversy from 2009 involving the quartet from Corpus Christi College, Oxford, memorably captained by Gail Trimble and including Kay, which won the final of that year's series of <em>University Challenge</em>.  Now, when your columnist did <em>UC</em> in the 2002-03 series it was made clear in the selection meeting that, because of the timing of the series recordings, final-year students were not eligible.  Kay was a final-year student at the start of the series, but was intending to stay on at Oxford by applying for a PhD.  That fell through.  By the time the quarter-finals and later stages were recorded, Kay had left Corpus and found work as an accountant, but he still took part in the recordings in breach of the series rules.  After the final was broadcast news of this got out, and the programme-makers Granada disqualified Corpus and stripped them of their title.  Whether you agree with that decision or not, the fault ultimately lay with Sam Kay.

Regrettably, Sam Kay's local government career didn't last much longer than his reign as a <em>University Challenge</em> champion.  He had been elected in May 2019 as a Liberal Democrat member of <b>Surrey Heath</b> council representing the town of <a href="https://tinyurl.com/rtrkq3q">Bagshot</a>, beating the alphabet to top the poll and riding the anti-Tory wave in that election.  Kay's death leaves the local Lib Dems with a tricky defence in a marginal ward in Michael Gove's constituency.  Richard Wilson is the defending Lib Dem candidate, opposed in a straight fight by the Tories' Mark Gordon.

The other standalone by-election comes over the river in <b>Spelthorne</b> district, based on Staines-upon-Thames and one of the few parts of Middlesex that escaped incorporation into Greater London in the 1960s.  The Conservatives lost a large majority here in the 2019 election and now run the district as a minority; one of the wards which fell was <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i4533">Staines South</a> ward, which returned two Liberal Democrats and one Labour councillor.  You get the impression that the opposition parties didn't see this result coming, as the Lib Dems finished with a big lead in votes but only had a slate of two for the three available seats.  Over the last two years Spelthorne council has suffered a number of defections and regroupings, including Lib Dem Staines South councillor Nichola Cornes who went independent and then resigned from the council altogether.  For the resulting by-election Rob Millist is the defending Lib Dem candidate, Harriet Digby stands for Labour and Sinead Mooney for the Conservatives.  The sort of defection level seen in Spelthorne often indicates a slightly dysfunctional council, and this political dysfunctionality may soon be joined by financial dysfunctionality.  Spelthorne council has invested massively in commercial property in recent years; their position is rather different to that of Croydon, who have made similar investments and run out of money, in that Spelthorne's portfolio is mostly generating rent, but whether the buildings are still worth what the council paid for them is another matter.

Of the Surrey councils holding elections by thirds this year, <b>Mole Valley</b> council (based on Leatherhead and Dorking) flipped straight to the Liberal Democrats in 2019; <b>Elmbridge</b> council (outer London suburbia around Weybridge and Walton-on-Thames) was taken over by a coalition of the residents groups and Lib Dems; while in <b>Tandridge</b> (the eastern end of the county, including Caterham and Oxted) and in <b>Woking</b> the Conservatives now have to rely on independent councillors for control.  In those areas, the primary focus for the Surrey Conservatives must be to stop the rot.  So far as Elmbridge is concerned, the Conservatives may be helped by what appears to be a breakdown in the Residents/Lib Dem pact: most of Elmbridge district is covered by the Esher and Walton parliamentary seat where the Lib Dems came close to knocking out foreign secretary Dominic Raab in December 2019, and the party appears to be trying to build on that success by contesting several Resident-held marginal wards.

The Tories do still retain overall control of <b>Reigate and Banstead</b> council (the M23/Brighton Line corridor) and the <b>Runnymede</b> district at the northern end of the county.  All of the seats on those councils were up in 2019 with new ward boundaries, and there don't appear to be many opportunities for opposition parties in the seats up for election there.

One interesting question will be whether these May 2019 underperformance feeds through to <b>Surrey county council</b>.  However, given that the Tories won 61 seats out of a possible 81 here in May 2017, it will take a lot for that majority to disappear.

<h2>Sussex</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

There was little of interest in the 2016 election for Sussex police and crime commissioner, which easily re-elected Conservative PCC Katy Bourne.  In the first round she led with 42% against 22% for Labour and 16% for UKIP; the run-off against Labour produced a Tory majority of 62-38.  Bourne is seeking a third term for the Conservatives; Labour have selected former Whitehall special adviser Paul Richards, while UKIP have not returned.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

There are elections this year for the whole of East Sussex and West Sussex county councils, for one-half of Adur and Hastings councils and for one-third of Crawley and Worthing councils.

The stand-out one of these to watch is <b>Crawley</b>.  This New Town got new ward boundaries in 2019 putting all 36 council seats up for re-election; in vote terms there was a photofinish with the Tories and Labour polling 42.6% each across the borough, while in seat terms Labour eked out a win by 19 to 17.  Since then two Labour councillors have died and two more have left the party, which at one point left the Conservative group holding half of the seats; a highly unusual situation has developed, with the Conservatives declining to seek control of the council for themselves and instead shoring up the Labour administration in advance of these elections.  Control of Crawley council is likely to come down to a handful of votes in one or more wards.

Things are on the other foot in the south coast resort of <b>Worthing</b> where Labour have made strong gains over the last electoral cycle.  Worthing council currently stands at 23 Conservative councillors against 10 Labour, 3 Lib Dems and a UKIP councillor; nearly half of the Tory group is up for re-election this year, and a repeat of the 2019 results would result in five Labour gains and a sharply-reduced Conservative majority.

The Tories have much less margin for error in the neighbouring <b>Adur</b> district, based on towns such as Shoreham on the coastal strip between Worthing and Brighton; they currently hold 16 seats (one of which is vacant) out of a possible 29.  Adur last went to the polls in 2018, and a repeat of those results would see the Conservatives gain two seats with UKIP wiped out.

The four local by-elections in West Sussex are all defences for the opposition.  <b>Arun</b> council, which stayed Conservative throughout the lean times of the 1990s, is now run by a minority Lib Dem administration following impressive results in 2019.  Among the Lib Dem gains that year were <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i16940">Brookfield</a> ward (in Littlehampton) where the party holds both seats, and <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i16951">Pevensey</a> ward (in Bognor Regis) where they split the two seats with an independent councillor.  The Lib Dems are defending both by-elections: Bob Woodman should be favoured to hold Brookfield, while John Barrett is the defending candidate in Pevensey but may face a challenge from independent Jan Cosgrove.

There is more long-standing Lib Dem strength in the <a href="https://tinyurl.com/yyhjfx3h">Trafalgar</a> ward of <b>Horsham</b>, which covers the west of the town and where their candidate Martin Boffey is favoured.  In <b>Mid Sussex</b> district the 2019 election saw the Conservatives lose <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i5402">Copthorne and Worth</a> ward (immediately to the east of Crawley) to an independent slate; Norman Mockford has come forward as a new independent candidate for this by-election against the Tories' Bruce Forbes.

The Conservative majority on <b>West Sussex county council</b> is in no danger.  <b>East Sussex county council</b> is however more balanced, with the 2017 election returning 30 Conservatives against 11 Lib Dems, 5 independents and 4 Labour councillors.  Since then the Tories have performed pretty poorly in the 2019 local elections in Bexhill-on-Sea and the 2018 local elections in Hastings, where all of the Labour county councillors come from.  One-half of <b>Hastings</b> council is up for election this year, and the Labour majority there looks safe.

Of the nine council by-elections in the East Sussex council area, eight are Conservative defences.  The new Hastings and Rye MP Sally-Ann Hart has vacated her seat on <b>Rother</b> council, provoking a by-election in <a href="https://tinyurl.com/vdkbphvk">Eastern Rother</a> ward which covers the villages around Rye.  This ward is safe Conservative and should return their candidate Lizzie Hacking.  The Tories are defending four by-elections in the sprawling <b>Wealden</b> district, including both wards in Heathfield and two of the six wards in Hailsham.  Three of these look safe and should be defended without fuss by their candidates Mike Baker (<a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i19210">Heathfield North</a>), Tom Guyton-Day (<a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i19211">Heathfield South</a>) and Kevin Balsdon (<a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i19207">Hailsham South</a>), but <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i19205">Hailsham North</a> ward was a three-way marginal in 2019 and could again be closely contested between Chris Bryant of the Conservatives, Paul Holbrook of the Lib Dems and Rachel Chilton of the Greens.

Over on the coastal strip, the Conservatives are defending two of the five Seaford wards in by-elections to <b>Lewes</b> council.  Both <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y4sfkl4k">Seaford East</a> (defended by Richard Turner) and Seaford West (defended by Linda Wallraven) look safe enough; the Greens ran second in both wards last time, but the decision by the Lib Dems to contest these by-elections may split their vote.  Lewes shares a lot of its services with <b>Eastbourne</b> council, where Conservative MP Caroline Ansell has vacated <a href="https://tinyurl.com/yyjwpnbl">Sovereign</a> ward; this is based on a relatively new marina development and as such is very unlike the rest of Eastbourne.  Sovereign ward is safe Tory and their defending candidate is Kshama Shore.  Finally, in the north of Eastbourne the Lib Dems defend a by-election in the very safe Hampden Park ward; their candidate is Josh Babarinde.

There are no scheduled local elections this year in <b>Brighton and Hove</b>, but there are two by-elections to the city council from wards in Caroline Lucas' Pavilion constituency.  <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i2036">Hollingdean and Stanmer</a> ward runs out along the railway line towards Lewes up to and including the University of Sussex campus.  This has been a Labour-Green marginal for the last decade, and in 2019 the ward split its representation between two Labour councillors and one Green.  Labour's Leila Erin-Jenkins will defend the by-election, the Greens' Zoë John will hope to gain.  <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i2039">Patcham</a> ward lies on the northern edge of the city at the point where the road and railway line from London break through the South Downs; this is a safe Conservative ward which Anne Meadows should defend for the party.

<h2>Kent</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

Our final English PCC election is for the county of Kent, which returned independent candidate Ann Barnes as its first police and crime commissioner in 2012.  Barnes retired in 2016 and the first round of the election to replace her saw Matthew Scott of the Conservatives top the poll with 33%.  Second with 27% was UKIP candidate Henry Bolton, who subsequently had his fifteen minutes of fame as leader of that party.  Labour's Tristan Osborne finished third with 19% of the vote, while independent candidate Gurvinder Singh Sander polled 10%.  Last of the six candidates that year was Steve Uncles of the English Democrats, who polled 3% and lost his deposit; Uncles was subsequently sent to prison for seven months for electoral fraud in the 2013 Kent county council elections, having submitted seven sets of nomination papers for English Democrats "candidates" who either hadn't consented to their nomination or never existed in the first place.  The run-off for the 2016 Kent PCC election was Conservative versus UKIP, with Scott beating Bolton by 54-46.

Matthew Scott is seeking re-election, and is opposed this time by two other candidates: Lola Oyewusi (who is also standing for the county council, in Sittingbourne South) for Labour and Graham Colley for the Lib Dems.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

There are elections this year for the whole of Kent county council and for one-third of Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells councils.  There are no local elections this year in the Medway towns.

<b>Tunbridge Wells</b> was extensively discussed by this column at the end of last year, as the 2019 local elections saw the Conservatives lose 13 of the 18 seats they were defending, and save one other seat on the toss of a coin following a tied result in Paddock Wood West ward.  To cut a long story short, a lot of that was down to proposals by the council for a new civic centre/theatre/underground car park complex which went down with the locals with, for want of a better word, disgust.  That cunning plan has since fallen by the wayside, but the ruling Conservatives will have to rebound a heck of a lot from last year's performance to hold onto their council majority.

<b>Maidstone</b> council is hung and likely to remain so; a Lib Dem-Independent administration is currently in place.  Maidstone is also home to <b>Kent county council</b>, whose Tory majority shouldn't be in danger.  The county council candidate lists have revealed a mistake by Labour who have managed to nominate two candidates for the Malling Central division (based on East and West Malling together with Larkfield off the M20 motorway); mind, Labour only polled 5% there in 2017 so this probably won't cost them a seat.  Sadly, the Labour candidate for Elham Valley division (a large swathe of the North Downs to the north of Folkestone) has died, and the poll there will be postponed to a later date.

The Conservative revival in the polls in late 2019 saw its first fruits on 17th October that year with a by-election gain in the <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i4811">Westcourt</a> ward of <b>Gravesham</b> (<em>Andrew's Previews 2019</em>, pages 323 and 329), a downmarket residential area in eastern Gravesend.  That Westcourt poll was the first council by-election the Conservatives had gained from Labour in over a year.  Well, we are back here again for a crucial local by-election to Gravesham council; if Labour lose this one as well, their council majority will go with it and they will be down to half of the seats.  Karina O'Malley defends this Westcourt by-election for Labour, Samir Jassal challenges for the Conservatives.

The Conservatives have three other local by-elections to defend in western Kent.  In the Darent valley there are by-elections to <b>Dartford</b> council from <a href="https://tinyurl.com/yxzqr32o">Darenth</a> ward (Maria Kelly defending) and from the cumbersomely-named neighbouring ward of Wilmington, Sutton-at-Hone and Hawley (Ellenor Palmer defending).  In <b>Sevenoaks</b> district the Tories defend a by-election in <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i4841">Brasted, Chevening and Sundridge</a> ward, covering villages immediately to the west of Sevenoaks at the south-east corner of the M25 (Keith Bonin defending).  None of these look in any danger.

East Kent's by-elections have a rather left-wing bias to them.  The by-election-prone <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y338atz9">Beaver</a> ward in the south of <b>Ashford</b> town comes to the notice of this column for the fourth time in ten years, following the death of one of the Labour councillors; Dylan Jones is the defending Labour candidate for a ward that should be safe enough for them.  In <b>Dover</b> district Labour defend <a href="https://tinyurl.com/2wafdume">Mill Hill</a> ward, the western of the four wards covering Deal: Jeffrey Loffman is the Labour candidate here in a ward that had good showings in 2019 for both the Conservatives (who have selected David Hawkes) and the Greens (Mike Eddy).

We finally get around to the by-election in the <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i4927">Newington</a> ward of <b>Thanet</b> which I previewed all the way back on 19th March 2020 but which was pulled by the returning officer due to the pandemic; all four candidates who were nominated in that poll have returned, with Mary King favoured to hold for Labour.  Newington ward is in Ramsgate as is <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i4917">Central Harbour</a> ward, which split its three seats between Labour and the Greens in 2019; confusingly, the defending Labour candidate has the name David Green, while the Greens have selected Tricia Austin.  Over in Margate we have a by-election in the <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i4921">Dane Valley</a> ward which is defended by the Thanet Independents, the main remnant of the UKIP group which won a majority on Thanet council in 2019.  Dane Valley voted Conservative in 2007, Labour at a December 2009 by-election and in 2011, then UKIP in 2015 before splitting its three seats in 2019 between the two Thanet Independents candidates and Labour, with the Tories close behind.  All three candidates for this Dane Valley by-election will feel they have realistic chances of winning: Mark Websper defends for the Thanet Independents, Martin Boyd is the Labour candidate, David Wallin stands for the Conservatives.

These three by-elections could be crucial to the future direction of Thanet council.  The 2019 Thanet election returned 25 Conservative councillors, 20 Labour, 7 Thanet Independents, 3 Greens and 1 independent; a Conservative minority administration was originally installed, then deposed in favour of a Labour minority administration.  The Labour council leader has recently resigned in an attempt to stave off a counter-coup attempt; a new leader will be elected on 13th May once the results of these by-elections are known.

Further along the north Kent coast Labour defend the town of <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i19390">Sheerness</a>, where they have held two out of three <b>Swale</b> council seats since the current ward was introduced in 2015.  The other seat went to UKIP in 2015 and to an independent candidate in 2019, so this by-election could be tricky to hold given the presence of a candidate from the Swale Independents council group.  Nicola Nelson is the Labour candidate, Dolley White stands for the Swale Independents.

The only Conservative by-election defence in East Kent is the <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i17456">Swalecliffe</a> ward of Whitstable, after Ian Thomas - who represented the area on both <b>Canterbury</b> council and Kent county council - took his own life after being arrested on suspicion of sexual assault.  The by-election is for Canterbury council only, and the defending Conservative candidate is Mark Dance.

In Canterbury proper we have a by-election for the city-centre <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i17459">Westgate</a> ward.  This was the destination point for many pilgrimages to the shrine of Thomas Becket over the centuries, so it's fitting that our tour of England's local by-elections on 6th May 2021 ends here.  Since it was redrawn in 2015 Westgate ward has returned councillors from all three main parties, with a Labour gain from the Conservatives at a by-election on 8th June 2017 presaging the Labour gain of the parliamentary seat later on that election night.  The 2019 poll here returned one Lib Dem and two Labour councillors, with the Conservatives now out of the running here.  Pip Hazelton defends for Labour, Alex Lister will try to gain for the Lib Dems.

<h2><em>In memoriam</em></h2>

The last year has, of course, been a terrible time for everyone.  I would like to pause here to remember and to pay tribute to the local councillors who have passed away over the two municipal years since May 2019.  Some of these people were veterans of local government, some only just beginning their careers in our council chambers; in some cases their friends and colleagues left behind can reflect on a long life well lived, in others we mourn those who passed before their time.  Some of these names have already appeared in this column over the last two years; but in too many cases, the pandemic has left insufficient space for their stories to be told here.  Where I have included a picture in the list below, that signifies that the councillor was reported to have died of COVID-19.

<h2>Final remarks</h2>

The UK's electoral services teams, who work their socks off all year round to put this show on for your benefit, have been hard at work to make sure that these elections are being run in line with the current public health restrictions.  If you are attending a polling station this year, you can have confidence that you can cast your vote safely.  The deadline to apply for a postal vote has passed; if you have a postal vote you should have received one by now.  In Scotland almost a quarter of the electorate have secured postal votes for this election, which is the highest proportion on record; there's no reason to believe that similar increases won't happen in England and Wales.

The Britain Elects team have put a huge amount of work into preparing for these local elections.  We are here to give you cold hard facts, facts which may turn out to be surprising.  In fact I fully expect that some of the results will surprise, and at least one ward will produce a result that makes my jaw drop.  These previews have been researched to the best of my ability, in line with the Andrew's Previews policy of covering "all the right votes, but not necessarily in the right order"; but they can't and won't all turn out as expected.

We have never previously tried holding ordinary county council and district council elections together.  Even in 1973, when the current local government structure was set up in many parts of England, the county and district elections were staggered with different tiers polling on different dates.  Add the other polls on top of that, and this is going to make for some horribly complicated and protracted counts at a time when space in our counting halls is at a premium.  Very few returning officers are going for a traditional overnight count this year; final results for the Scottish Parliament and the London Assembly won't be available until Saturday, and the count for several of the Police and Crime Commissioners won't even start until the Monday after the election.  The election-watcher's vigil this May is going to be a long one.  There will be plenty of time to hunker down with your snacks of choice and to read this primer on what to look out for in the results.

It only remains for me to wish the very best of luck to everybody participating in these elections - whether as a voter, as a candidate or as an administrator.  Whoever you support, whoever you vote for, do have an enjoyable election, and I'll see you on the other side.

<em>Andrew Teale</em>
