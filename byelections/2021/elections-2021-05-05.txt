"All the right votes, but not necessarily in the right order"

Well, you have to start somewhere.  Welcome to Andrew's Previews' countdown to the May 2021 elections, which promise (in that hazy, faraway fantasy called the future) to be one of the biggest electoral events of this Parliament.  The whole of Great Britain is due to go to the polls.  And there's not just one type of election involved: many voters will have two, three or (in some cases) four ballot papers to juggle, and multiple electoral systems abound.  It's complicated.

For this reason there will be a long series (quite a long series) of Preview pieces.  I'm going to start by setting out the scene in the north-east of England.  Here we have up for election the police and crime commissioners for Northumbria, Durham and Cleveland; the Mayors of the Tees Valley and North Tyneside; and elections for a third of the five Tyne and Wear boroughs and the whole of Northumberland, Durham and Hartlepool councils.

<h2>Comparisons</h2>

The hybrid nature of the May 2021 elections means that any comparison is inevitably going to be confusing.  There are two different baselines to consider.

Most of the posts up for election next year were last filled in 2016, which was a very close set of local elections in England: the BBC's Projected National Share put Labour under Jeremy Corbyn on 31%, the Conservatives under David Cameron on 30%, the Lib Dems on 15% and UKIP on 12%.  In the Scottish Parliament, the SNP gained vote share but lost its overall majority; the party has been running Holyrood as a minority since.  Labour fell short of a majority in the National Assembly for Wales (as it was then), but stayed in power with the support of the single Liberal Democrat member.  Sadiq Khan gained the London mayoralty for Labour following the retirement of Boris Johnson who had chosen re-enter politics on the national stage, with some success.  Finally, the second set of Police and Crime Commissioner elections saw a bonfire of many of the independents who had been elected on comedy turnouts in November 2012.

May 2016 was very much another time, and by May 2017 things were very different.  This set of local elections came slap-bang in the middle of Theresa May's snap election campaign, and very much in her honeymoon period.  The BBC's Projected National Share had an eleven-point Conservative lead, with 38% against 27% for Labour and 18% for the Liberal Democrats.  With 2017 being (in England) essentially a county council year, and with UKIP having done well in the 2013 county elections, that resulted in big seat gains for the Conservatives who gained Derbyshire from Labour and won majorities in Cambridgeshire, East Sussex, Gloucestershire, Lancashire, Lincolnshire, Norfolk, Suffolk, Warwickshire and the Isle of Wight.

So, let's break down the country into its police areas and see what's going on.

<h2>Northumbria</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

Vera Baird, the former Labour MP for Redcar, was Northumbria PCC from 2012 until 2019 when she resigned to become Victims' Commissioner for England and Wales.  The resulting by-election, held in July 2019, saw Labour's Kim McGuinness, a Newcastle upon Tyne city councillor, take the lead on first preferences: 38%, against 22% each for two Northumberland councillors, independent candidate Georgina Hill and Conservative Robbie Moore; the Lib Dems coming in fourth and last with 19%.  Having placed second narrowly ahead of Moore, Hill got into the runoff and picked up most of the transfers, meaning that McGuinness was elected in the final reckoning by the narrow margin of 52-48.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

The whole of Northumberland county council is up for election along with one-third of the seats in the five Tyne and Wear boroughs and the elected mayoralty of North Tyneside.

<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2017/northumberland17.png" />

The Conservatives almost won an overall majority in Northumberland in May 2017.  Their 12 net gains, for a total of 33 seats, were mostly due to a collapse by the Lib Dems who lost all their seats in the Berwick upon Tweed constituency.  However, the Conservatives did also gain two seats in Cramlington (one of them from Laura Pidcock, who subsequently had an ill-starred Parliamentary career in North West Durham) and tied for first place in the South Blyth division whose Lib Dem councillor was re-elected on the returning officer's drawing of lots.  This was a sign of things to come: Cramlington and Blyth are both in the Blyth Valley constituency which was the first declared Conservative gain of the December 2019 general election.  With 33 seats against 24 for Labour, 7 independents and 3 Lib Dems the Conservatives formed a minority administration, although they're a man down at the moment after Robbie Moore (their candidate in the Northumbria PCC by-election) was elected in December 2019 as MP for Keighley.  His seat in Alnwick is vacant.  Laura Pidcock's father died in 2019; he was a Northumberland councillor, and Labour held the resulting by-election in Holywell division.

<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/sunderland19.png" />

The largest of the five Tyne and Wear boroughs is another early declarer: the city of Sunderland.  This column wrote in 2019 that Sunderland has a Labour administration which is very locally unpopular while also having a very secure majority, and despite the fact that Labour lost 12 councillors in 2019 that's still true.  The Labour group currently has 51 seats (three of which are vacant), against 12 Conservatives, 8 Lib Dems, 3 UKIPpers and 1 Green (whose seat is vacant).  There are 10 wards with split representation and Labour are defending every single one of them; but for the party's majority to be in serious danger they'd have to do far worse even than in 2019.  Three wards have double vacancy elections: Copt Hill (covering villages to the west of the city, which was close between Labour and UKIP in 2019), Shiney Row (more villages to the west of the city, safe Labour) and Washington South (the unlikely-looking Green gain in 2019; the by-election is for the Green councillor, who was sitting on a majority of three votes).

<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/newcastletyne19.png" />

Things are much more secure for Labour in the other four Tyne and Wear boroughs.  In Newcastle upon Tyne the party has 54 seats (five of which are vacant) against 20 Lib Dems and four independents and localists.  A repeat of the 2019 results would see Labour lose three seats: North Jesmond and Ouseburn to the Lib Dems, and Callington and Throckley ward to the localists.  There are double-vacancy elections in Byker ward (safe Labour) and Chapel ward (on the western outskirts of the city, and safe for an independent slate).

<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/ntyneside19.png" />

North Tyneside is different to the other four Tyne and Wear boroughs in that it has an elected mayor.  The mayoralty has been held by both Labour and the Conservatives in the past with a number of very close results, but the last mayoral election in 2017 had a big lead for Labour's Norma Redfearn who was re-elected in the first round with a 56-31 lead over the Conservatives.  Labour hold 51 of the 60 seats on the council (one of which is vacant) against 7 Conservatives, a Lib Dem and an independent; a repeat of the 2019 results would see the Conservatives gain Cullercoats and Tynemouth wards from Labour, but Labour would gain Monkseaton North from the Conservatives and also pick up the Lib Dem seat in Northumberland ward.  In the event that the Conservatives gain the mayoralty, it's likely that the new mayor will have to cohabit with a Labour-majority council.  Labour councillor Kate Osborne has vacated her seat in Preston ward after being elected as MP for Jarrow; this is the northern ward of North Shields, and has returned Conservative councillors before but not since 2010.  There are also double vacancies in Chirton ward (safe Labour), and St Mary's ward (the northern end of Whitley Bay, safe Conservative).

<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/gateshead19.png" />

Gateshead is a borough where very little seems to change from election to election.  There are currently 52 Labour seats (one of which is vacant) against 12 Lib Dems and two independent councillors who were elected on the Lib Dem ticket.  One of the defectors (in Whickham South and Sunniside) is up for re-election next year.  A repeat of the 2019 results would result in no change to the Labour total.  There are double vacancies in both seats covering the town of Birtley; Labour councillor Mary Foy of Lamesley ward (northern Birtley and southern fringes of Gateshead, including the Angel of the North) is now the MP for the City of Durham, and Labour are also defending two seats in Birtley proper.

<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/styneside19.png" />

South Tyneside, on the other hand, had some excitement in the 2019 elections where Labour lost five seats, four to independents and the other (Beacon and Bents ward, covering South Shields town centre) to the Green Party.  There has been some infighting in the Labour group since, with the council leader resigning his seat in Horsley Hill ward (the South Shields coast, including the Great North Run finish line); there will be a by-election there and a second by-election in the Monkton ward covering south-western Jarrow.  In 2016 Labour won a clean sweep of all 18 wards, some of which may prove tricky to defend; although with 47 seats out of a possible 54 it is impossible for the party to lose its majority here.

<h2>Durham</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

Ron Hogg, who had led the English police response against football hooliganism during the 2002 FIFA World Cup in Japan and South Korea, had been the Durham PCC since 2012.  Hogg died in December 2019 and his deputy, Steven White, is serving as PCC in an acting capacity until an election can be held.  Hogg had been re-elected in the first round in 2016, defeating the Conservatives 64-24.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2017/durham17.png" />

There are whole council elections this year for Durham council.  The last elections here were in 2017 and left Labour with a reduced majority.  They won 74 seats against 25 for various categories of independents and localists, 14 for the Liberal Democrats (who are particularly strong in Durham city), 10 Conservatives and 3 seats for the North East Party, a regionalist movement with a powerbase in the New Town of Peterlee.  None of the ten Conservative councillors were elected in the North West Durham constituency, which the party now holds in Westminster.  There have been six by-elections since 2017, with Labour holding three, the Lib Dems holding one and (in May 2019) gaining Shildon and Dene Valley from Labour, and a very fragmented by-election in Spennymoor in May 2019 which saw an independent candidate finish in first place with just 19% of the vote, succeeding a different independent.

There are no scheduled local elections this year in Darlington, but that borough will take part in the Tees Valley mayoral election discussed in the next section.  Darlington council does have two by-elections: Paul Howell, the new Conservative MP for Sedgefield, has vacated his seat in <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i17469">Hummersknott</a> ward on the western edge of town, while on the eastern edge of town Labour are defending the <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i17477">Red Hall and Lingfield</a> ward which Howell unsuccessfully contested in 2015.  Both of those wards were safe in 2019, although Red Hall and Lingfield was fairly close in a November 2017 by-election (<em>Andrew's Previews 2017</em>, page 343).

<h2>Cleveland</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

The Cleveland PCC since 2012 has been Labour's Barry Coppinger, a Labour man who had previously sat on Middlesbrough council.  Having already announced his retirement, Coppinger resigned as PCC in 2020 and his deputy has taken over for the rest of his term.  Coppinger was re-elected in 2016 with a 62-38 lead over the Conservatives in the runoff.

<h3>Tees Valley mayoralty</h3>

The Tees Valley mayoral election the following year told a completely different story.  The electorate here consists of the four Cleveland boroughs plus Darlington, and the addition of Darlington made all the difference.  Ben Houchen, who had previously been leader of the Conservative group on Stockton-on-Tees council, was elected as the first Mayor of the Tees Valley by the narrow margin of 51.1% to 48.9% over Labour in the runoff, having led 39.5-39.0 on first preferences.  With the Conservatives having gained three seats here in December 2019 (plus the Sedgefield constituency, part of which is in Darlington borough), and with local elections across the area since 2017 having been dire for Labour, Houchen must be fairly confident about the prospect of re-election.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/hartlepool19.png" />

The only council in Cleveland holding ordinary local elections this year is Hartlepool, where local politics has been bizarre for many years and seems to have got more so since the Monkey Mayor left the scene.  All simian and indeed human life is here, and the council membership is the broadest of broad churches with members from the Socialist Labour Party at one end of the political spectrum, the For Britain Movement at the other end and representatives of nearly every viewpoint in between.  The Scargillite group is in fact the former Labour council leadership following a split in early 2019; that split and six seat losses for Labour in May 2019 means that the town is now in the hands of a group which was originally called the Independent Union, before affiliating to the Brexit Party, before leaving the Brexit Party and becoming the Independent Union again.  They are running the show in alliance with those obvious political bedfellows the Scargillites and the Conservatives.  Defections abound to the extent that this column has completely lost track of what is going in the Pool.  The usual medicine for political basket cases like Hartlepool is to hit the reset button with an all-out election, and as luck would have it the Local Government Boundary Commission were in town recently so there will be an all-out election this year on new ward boundaries.

<h2>Cumbria</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

The Cumbria PCC position has been held by the Conservatives since 2012.  Peter McCall, a former Army officer who commanded a squadron during the Bosnian war, has served since 2016.  On the first count he had 34% of the vote against 24% for Labour, 17% for the Lib Dems and 15% for an independent candidate; in the runoff McCall defeated the Labour candidate by 58-42.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

The scheduled elections this year for the whole of Cumbria county council and one-third of Carlisle and South Lakeland councils have been cancelled, pending a possible reorganisation of local government in the area.

This has left us with lots of by-elections.

<h2>Lancashire</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

The Lancashire police and crime commissioner is Labour's Clive Grunshaw.  In May 2016 he polled 44% in the first round against 32% for the Conservatives and 17% for UKIP, and went on to win the run-off by a 56-44 margin.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

There are elections this year for the whole of Lancashire county council, the whole of Chorley and Pendle councils on new ward boundaries, and one-third of Blackburn with Darwen, Burnley, Hyndburn, Preston, Rossendale and West Lancashire councils.

Lancashire county council has swung rather wildly in recent years: Labour in 2005, Conservative in 2009, hung in 2013 with Labour as the largest party, Conservative in 2017.  That election returned 46 Conservative councillors against 30 Labour, 4 Lib Dems, 2 independents, a Green councillor and the only UKIP councillor returned in 2017 (in Padiham ad Burnley West; he is now in the Conservative group).  The Tories had a majority of 8 seats which rests on particularly good results in marginal Rossendale and Colne and the New Town territory of Leyland.  There are a large number of marginal divisions in these areas, and on current polling this will be a difficult council for the Conservatives to defend.

The Conservatives did particularly well in East Lancashire at the 2019 general election, but generally this wasn't off a strong local government base.  Their strongest council is Pendle covering the towns of Nelson and Colne, but the Conservatives lost control here in May 2019 to a Labour/Lib Dem coalition.  There are new ward boundaries in Pendle this year with all the seats up for election; at the time of writing the Conservatives hold 22 seats (two of which are vacant), Labour 16 (one of which is vacant), the Lib Dems have 10 and there is one independent.  One of the Tory vacancies is in respect of the new Bury South MP Christian Wakeford, who was the group leader here before he entered the Commons; Wakeford was subsequently thrown off Pendle council under the six-month non-attendance rule, which doesn't say much for his organisational skills.

Further down the Calder valley we come to Burrnley, which elected MPs from all three main parties in the last decade but whose council elections tell a rather different story.  Labour lost their majority on Burrnley council in May 2019, and the council currently stands at 22 Labour seats against 8 Lib Dems, 7 localists and independents, 6 Tories (three of whom were elected on the UKIP ticket) and 2 Greens.  A rainbow anti-Labour coalition was formed after the 2019 election, but this fell apart in September 2020 and Labour are back in minority control.  If the 2019 results are repeated, Labour would lose Trinity ward to the Greens and Rosegrove with Lowerhouse to the localists.

Hyndburn district (based on Accrington) has a Tory MP now but a large Labour majority on its council, which currently stands at 26 Labour seats (one of which is vacant) and 9 Conservative seats (one of which is vacant).  The vacant seats are in the politically split wards of Barnfield (in eastern Accrington) and Overton (in Great Harwood).  A repeat of the 2019 results would result in those seats swapping to give no net change here.

By contrast Labour have a difficult defence of Rossendale council over the moors in the upper Irwell valley.  They currently hold 19 out of 36 councillors, against 13 Tories and 4 independents and localists.  This time Labour are defending three wards which voted Conservative in 2019 together with Eden ward, a normally-Tory area which surprisingly went Labour in 2016 in the aftermath of severe flooding in Irwell Vale on Boxing Day 2015.  This is one to watch.

South-facing Rossendale is paired for parliamentary purposes with north-facing Darwen, which is part of the borough of Blackburn with Darwen.  This is strongly Labour (34 out of 51 seats at present) and if the 2019 results are repeated Labour would gain one seat from the Conservatives.

Perhaps surprisingly Labour have an even larger majority on Chorley council (37 out of 47 seats), having gained five seats here from the Conservatives in 2019.  There are new ward boundaries in Chorley this year with all the seats on the council up for election, which may give the Tories some chance of fighting back although they start a long way behind.

New ward boundaries came in last year for Preston, resulting in a Labour majority with 30 seats against 9 each for the Tories and Lib Dems.  Only one ward could be reasonably described as marginal on the basis of the 2019 results (Tory-held Sharoe Green ward in Fulwood) so we shouldn't expect much if any change here.

West Lancashire elections are normally a snoozefest, this being an extremely polarised district where two-party swings are low; however, this year promises to be interesting.  Currently Labour have 29 seats, the Conservatives have 19 and there are 6 councillors from the OWL group.  The OWLs are not what they seem: the initials represent Our West Lancashire, a localist group which won all three wards in Ormskirk in the 2019 election.  This time round Labour are defending two of the Ormskirk wards, and if they lose them both it will probably be No Overall Control time.

<h2>Merseyside</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

The Merseyside PCC position is held by Labour's Jane Kennedy.  In 2016 she won in the first round with 62% of the vote, the Conservatives being her nearest challengers on 18%.

<h3>Liverpool City Region mayoral election</h3>

The Liverpool City Region mayoralty covers a larger area than just Merseyside, with the Halton borough also included; this covers the towns of Runcorn and Widnes up the Mersey estuary.  The first mayoral election was held in May 2017 and was a convincing win for the outgoing Liverpool Walton MP Steve Rotheram, who defeated Tory candidate Tony Caldeira in the first round by 59% to 20%.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

There are elections this year for one-third of all the Merseyside boroughs plus the elected mayoralty of Liverpool.

The Liverpool mayoralty is likely to be the main point of interest in the big city.  Labour's Joe Anderson performed poorly in 2016 relative to PCC Jane Kennedy; Big Joe won in the first round with 53% compared to 20% for the Liberal Democrats and 11% for the Green Party.  Recent legal troubles have forced him out of office, and there will be a new Labour candidate.  Labour are in an impregnable position on the city council with 73 out of 91 seats; a repeat of the 2019 results would see them lose one seat nett to the Greens.

Labour control of Knowsley is also secure, despite a poor performance in the 2019 election - a repeat of that would see the Green Party gain two seats and an independent gain one.  A similar story played out in St Helens in 2019, where the Greens won two wards from nowhere and were close in a number of others; a repeat of those results would see Labour lose four seats.

By contrast Labour are on the rise in Sefton, having finally broken through into the traditional Lib Dem stronghold of Southport.  They have a good chance of four seat gains this year (two from the Lib Dems in Southport, two from independents in Maghull) to increase the Labour majority.  Currently Labour hold 43 out of 66 seats here, which is a mark of how far this area has swung to the left: Sefton had never had a Labour majority before 2012.

The Labour majority over the water in Wirral council has disappeared since the 2019 election partially as a result of infighting following a left-wing takeover.  There are three wards with split representation, and this year Labour are defending all of them: Birkenhead/Tranmere and Prenton voted Green in 2019, whereas Pensby and Thingwall voted Conservative.

<h2>Cheshire</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

David Keane gained the Cheshire PCC post for Labour from the Conservatives in 2016.  On first preferences he had 40% of the vote to 38% for the Tories and 12% for UKIP; in the run-off Cheshire went Labour by the narrow margin of 51% to 49%, a majority of 2,949 votes.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

Following the 2019 local elections Labour, for the first time, have a monopoly on local government in Cheshire, running as a majority or as a minority all the local government districts which cover the county.  And this is true whatever current or historical definition of Cheshire you use.  Rather striking for the county that includes the richest areas of north-west England.

There are elections this year for all the councillors in Halton and Warrington, with new ward boundaries coming in for Halton.  Both of these councils have strong Labour majorities at present (51 out of 56 seats in Halton, 45 out of 58 seats in Warrington).  The Conservatives gained the Warrington South parliamentary seat in December 2019 but that wasn't based on local government strength: in 2016 the party won just two seats on Warrington council (in the Real Housewives territory of Lymm South) and one of those has since gone Lib Dem in a by-election.

There are no local elections of any sort this year in Cheshire East or in Cheshire West and Chester.

<h2>Greater Manchester</h2>

<h3>Mayor of Greater Manchester</h3>

The Greater Manchester mayoralty was created in 2017, subsuming the Police and Crime Commissioner post.  Andy Burnham had a big win in the inaugural GM mayoral election, crushing the Tory candidate Sean Anstee by 63% to 23% in the first round.  Unusually, a ward-level breakdown of the count was published, and the number of wards Anstee carried in the county (out of a possible 214) can be counted on the fingers of two hands.  Little which has happened since 2017 suggests that Burnham will struggle for re-election.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

There are elections this year for the whole of Salford council on new ward boundaries, the Mayor of Salford, and one-third of the councillors in the other nine Greater Manchester boroughs.

The only Conservative-run metropolitan borough in the North of England is the Greatest Town in the Known Universe.  Following a decisive rejection of Labour in the 2019 Bolton council election a minority Conservative administration (currently with 20 out of 60 councillors) was installed by a gaggle of localist groups, the Lib Dems and UKIP.  Labour are going to need to do a lot better than in 2019 to stem further seat losses (they are defending three or four wards which voted Tory, Lib Dem or localist last time out), so some sort of anti-Labour administration looks likely to continue.

The localist surge seen in Bolton could also cost Labour control of neighbouring Bury this year.  Bury currently has 28 Labour councillors, 16 Conservatives, 4 Lib Dems and 3 independents elected on a localism ticket in the forgotten town of Radcliffe, giving a Labour majority of 3.  In 2019 Labour lost Radcliffe North ward to the Conservatives, Radcliffe East ward to the localists and St Mary's ward in Prestwich to the Lib Dems; the localists subsequently took a by-election off Labour in working-class Radcliffe West.  Labour are defending all those wards this year.  While Labour do have chances to offset any losses in that list by gaining Conservative seats in Ramsbottom and Prestwich's Sedgley ward (which will be an interesting test of whether the party has sorted out its anti-Semitism problem), there are several other marginal Labour wards which the Tories will have their eyes on, such as Elton and Unsworth; and of course this is a borough with two extremely marginal Conservative parliamentary seats.  This is one to watch.

The other major battle in Greater Manchester would appear to be for Stockport council.  This is currently tied at 26 seats each for Labour and the Lib Dems, with 8 Conservatives and three Heald Green ratepayers holding the balance of power.  In 2019 the Lib Dems gained five seats from the Conservatives and they have a chance of a further gain this year in Marple South and High Lane ward; that would probably make them the largest party on the council and could result in a change of control.

The other seven Greater Manchester boroughs have impregnable Labour majorities, and that includes Salford where all 60 councillors are up for re-election on new ward boundaries this year.  The new lines have created a completely new ward in the inner city, reflecting large housing developments under construction in the Quays area; the new Quays ward is hugely undersized at the moment in population terms but this should resolve itself over the next few years.  Salford has an elected mayor of its own, currently Labour's Paul Dennett who won the 2016 mayoral election in the first round: he polled 51% against 26% for the Conservatives and 16% for UKIP.

<h2>West Yorkshire</h2>

<h3>Mayor of West Yorkshire</h3>

The latest piece in the devolution jigsaw will slot into place in these elections with the first poll for the West Yorkshire mayoralty.  This position covers the five metropolitan boroughs of Bradford, Calderdale, Kirklees, Leeds and Wakefield, and will replace the West Yorkshire police and crime commissionership.

The outgoing PCC is Labour's Mark Burns-Williamson, who has overseen the county's police force almost continuously since 2003 when became chairman of the former West Yorkshire police authority.  In the 2016 election he came very close to winning in the first round, polling just under 50% against 23% for the Conservatives and 14% for UKIP, and increased his lead to 66-34 in the runoff.

Burns-Williamson is not standing again.  For the new mayoralty Labour have selected Tracey Brabin, a former <em>Coronation Street</em> actress who has been MP for Batley and Spen since winning the 2016 by-election after Jo Cox' murder.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

There are elections this year for one-third of the councillors in all five West Yorkshire boroughs.  All of these had Labour majorities following the party's gain of Calderdale in May 2019; that council's Labour group (currently 28 councillors out of 51) has the chance to substantially increase its majority this year, as the Conservatives are defending 6 wards which voted for Labour, Lib Dem or an independent candidate in 2019.

The Labour majority in Kirklees district, however, disappeared in November 2020 after three councillors walked out of the party and went independent.  The party also faces a relatively difficult ward map - a repeat of the 2019 results would see Labour make a net loss of one seat.  Two of the Conservative gains in West Yorkshire at the December 2019 election are within Kirklees district - Colne Valley and Dewsbury - but the party has some catching up to do at the local level.

The other three West Yorkshire boroughs have comfortable Labour majorities, particularly so in Wakefield where the party holds three-quarters of the seats.  The Conservatives made no impression at all here in 2019 - they held the four seats they were defending but fell short in their target ward of Wrenthorpe and weren't particularly close anywhere else.  Despite this, the party broke through to gain the Wakefield parliamentary constituency in December 2019.  The council's ward map is better for the Conservatives this year, as they will have the chance to gain the two Ossett wards which Labour are now defending.

<h2>North Yorkshire</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

The North Yorkshire PCC position is Conservative-held.  The incumbent is Julia Mulligan, who in the 2016 election polled 40% against 26% for Labour and 23% for an independent candidate, beating Labour 59-41 in the runoff.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

The scheduled elections this year for the whole of North Yorkshire county council and one-third of Craven council have been postponed to 2022, to allow time for a consultation on local government reorganisation.

<h2>Humberside</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

Labour gained the Humberside PCC position at the 2016 election, defeating Tory incumbent Matthew Grove 60-40 in the runoff; the first round had given 40% to Labour, 27% to the Conservatives and 18% to UKIP.  Grove had won narrowly in 2012, defeating the UKIP MEP Godfrey Bloom and former Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott.  The Labour incumbent going into the 2021 election is former police chief superintendent Keith Hunter.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

Two of the four Humberside boroughs are holding elections this year.  North East Lincolnshire, based on Grimsby, Cleethorpes and surrounding villages, has swung a mile to the right in recent years at both parliamentary and council level; the Tories won an overall majority here in 2019, and a repeat of those results would see them gain four more seats.

Things are rather different over the Humber estuary in the big city of Kingston upon Hull.  This has a rather narrow Labour majority of 31/57 seats, with a significant Liberal Democrat opposition of 24.  The city got new ward boundaries in 2018, and a repeat of the 2019 results would result in no net changes.

There are no local elections this year in North Lincolnshire or in the East Riding.

<h2>South Yorkshire</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

The South Yorkshire police and crime commissionership is held by Labour's Alan Billings, an academic and priest who has served since winning a by-election in 2014.  He was re-elected in the first round in 2016, polling 52% against 20% for UKIP and 11% for the Conservatives.  Although he is now well into his seventies, Billings is seeking a third term.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

There are elections this year for the whole of Rotherham council on new ward boundaries, the whole of Doncaster council and one-third of Barnsley and Sheffield councils.

Rotherham council has had a troubled recent history, being taken over by Commissioners in 2014 following a huge child sexual exploitation scandal.  In that year's local elections the UK Independence Party won 10 seats on Rotherham council, which they increased to 14 at a whole-council election in 2016: Labour won 48 seats that year, and the remaining seat went to an independent candidate in Anston and Woodsetts ward.  The Rother Valley parliamentary seat, which the Conservatives gained in December 2019, is one of several seats with a Tory MP but no Tory local councillors; the party will have a chance to do something about that this year.  Rotherham UKIP have since rebadged as the "Rotherham Democratic Party".

Doncaster went over to the elected mayoral system some years ago.  The current mayor is Ros Jones of the Labour party, who narrowly defeated the English Democrats mayor Peter Davies in 2013; Jones had a much easier time in the 2017 mayoral election, winning in the first round with 51% of the vote against 21% for the Conservatives and 12% for UKIP.  She is backed up by a large Labour majority on Doncaster council: the simultaneous 2017 council election returned 43 Labour councillors, 7 Conservatives, 3 localists from Mexborough and two independents.

Despite some extremely wacky results in 2019, including two seat gains for the Democrats and Veterans Party (the "gay donkey" UKIP splinter group), the Labour majority in Barnsley looks completely safe.  The big city of Sheffield should be more hotly contested.  The Labour group is currently on 45 councillors plus four vacant seats, with 43 being a majority; a repeat of the 2019 results would see Labour lose seven seats nett to the Lib Dems and Greens, putting that majority in danger.

Sheffield, Richmond (Lab)

<h2>Derbyshire</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

The Derbyshire PCC election in 2016 was very close.  In the first round Labour's Hardyal Dhindsa led with just 37% of the vote, against 35% for the Conservatives' Richard Bright and 17% for UKIP.  Bright picked up most of the transfers in the runoff, but it wasn't enough as Dhindsa prevailed by 50.5% to 49.5%, a majority of 1,613 votes out of over 150,000.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

There are elections this year for the whole of Derbyshire county council and for one-third of Amber Valley and Derby councils.

Amber Valley is a very swingy council based on the towns of Belper and Heanor to the north of Derby.  This was a Labour gain from the Conservatives in 2019, but the party will have a difficult time defending their majority; this year all the traditionally Labour-voting wards in the east of the district are due to poll. and the party is defending 11 of the 15 wards up for election.  If the Conservatives are having a good night, they have a realistic chance of making the gains they need for outright control.

The Conservatives do currently run Derby city council as a minority.  The city has become very politically balanced, with currently 19 Conservative councillors, 15 Labour, 8 Lib Dems, a five-strong Reform Derby group who were elected on the UKIP ticket, and three independents.  A repeat of the 2019 results would see the Conservatives lose 1 seat and Labour lose 2.

Derby city is not covered by Derbyshire county council, which has swung wildly between the two main parties at the last three elections: it was a Tory gain in 2009, a Labour gain in 2013 and a Tory gain again in 2017.  In seat terms the Conservative win four years ago looks pretty large - 37 seats against 24 Labour and 3 Lib Dems - but in vote terms it won't take that much of a swing for many of those seats to change hands.  For example, in the High Peak district the Conservatives hold three county seats in Buxton and Glossop on very small majorities; and the party hasn't performed particularly well there since, only narrowly gaining the High Peak constituency in December 2019 and resoundingly losing a by-election in Whaley Bridge to the former Labour MP two months later.  The Tory candidate to take Whaley Bridge back in this election certainly has name recognition - she is the former MP Edwina Currie.  Labour may have lost Dennis Skinner's Bolsover seat in December 2019, but given the majorities involved it will take another special Tory performance for them to gain any county divisions in that corner of Derbyshire.

<h2>Nottinghamshire</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

The Nottinghamshire PCC since 2012 has been Paddy Tipping, the former Labour MP for the Sherwood constituency who served for a time as Deputy Leader of the Commons during the last Labour Government.  Tipping was re-elected quite easily in 2016: in the first round he led with 47% against 28% for the Conservatives and 12% for UKIP, and he increased his lead to 62-38 in the runoff.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

There are elections this year for Nottinghamshire county council only.  There are no local elections this year in the city of Nottingham.

The Conservatives have had spectacular success in Nottinghamshire at parliamentary level in recent years.  They now hold all eight constituencies in the area covered by the county council, having gained Ashfield and Bassetlaw in 2019 to add to the gain of Mansfield in 2017.  The task now for the party is to make this dominance stick at county council level, as the Tories do not have a majority at the county hall in West Bridgford and are governing in coalition with the Mansfield Independent Forum.  That group along with the Zadroznyite Ashfield Independents will form a large independent bloc on the new county council, so for the gains they need for a majority the Tories will likely have to look elsewhere: perhaps in the northern Nottingham suburbs of Arnold and Carlton, where there are a number of marginal Labour divisions.  The Tories must have carried a number of divisions in Worksop in December 2019 given their huge majority in Bassetlaw, but as in neighbouring Bolsover the Labour county councillors there are sitting on very large majorities from May 2017.

<h2>Lincolnshire</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

The 2016 Lincolnshire PCC election turned in a fragmented first-round result after the independent incumbent retired.  In a field of four candidates the Conservatives' Marc Jones led with 35% against 26% for UKIP candidate Victoria Ayling, 23% for Labour and 17% for the Lincolnshire Independents, a long-standing group of independent county councillors.  Jones and Ayling went into the runoff, which Jones won 56-44 to gain the position for the Conservatives.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

There are elections this year for the whole of Lincolnshire county council and for one-third of Lincoln council.  These shouldn't see much excitement.  Lincoln city council is the only Labour-controlled district in Lincolnshire; their majority over the Conservatives is 24-9, and a repeat of the 2019 results would see three Tory seats flip to Labour.  Lincolnshire county council returned a large Tory majority in the 2017 election, after a large UKIP caucus in the 2013-17 term fell apart; unless something similarly seismic happens the Conservatives are in no danger at the county hall this time.

<h2>Northamptonshire</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

Northants' police and crime commissioner election in 2016 was a three-way fight.  The first round was relatively close with 41% for the new Conservative candidate Stephen Mold, 36% for Labour and 24% for UKIP; UKIP's transfers broke for the Conservatives giving them a 54-46 win in the final reckoning.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

Northamptonshire's local government has been reorganised this year following the financial failure of Northamptonshire county council.  2021 sees the inaugural elections for the two new councils of North Northamptonshire and West Northamptonshire.

West Northamptonshire is the larger of the two with around 307,000 electors on the roll.  The county town of Northampton accounts for slightly under half of the electorate, and should be comfortably outvoted by the former rural districts of Daventry and South Northamptonshire which are true blue.  Similar considerations apply in North Northamptonshire, which succeeds the former districts of Corby, East Northamptonshire, Kettering and Wellingborough.  Corby is a strongly Labour-voting town, and the party can also perform decently in Kettering, but politically these will be red islands in a large blue lake.  Mind, we only have parliamentary election data from Northamptonshire in recent years, because the May 2019 elections for all the districts here were cancelled in advance of the reorganisation.

<h2>Leicestershire</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

Leicestershire's police and crime commissionership was gained by Labour in the 2016 election.  Lord Bach, who served as a junior minister for much of the Blair and Brown years in the defence and environment departments and the whip's office, led in the first round with 45% against 31% for the Conservatives and 13% for the Liberal Democrats; in the final reckoning he beat the Conservatives 57-43.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

There are elections this year for Leicestershire county council only.  Unlike the PCC position this has a large Conservative majority thanks to the absence of Labour-voting Leicester city, which has unitary status; the Lib Dems form the main opposition on the county council thanks to their strength in Oadby, Wigston and Hinckley.  The 2017 election returned 36 Conservatives, 13 Lib Dems and 6 Labour councillors.  Not much is likely to change here.

There are no local elections this year in the city of Leicester or in Rutland.

<h2>Warwickshire</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

Independent Warwickshire PCC Ron Ball retired at the 2016 election leaving the position open.  On the first count the Conservatives led with 31%, Labour had 25%, UKIP 13% and independent candidate Dave Whitehouse 11%; the Tories and Labour went through to the runoff where the Conservatives won by 55-45.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

There are elections this year for the whole of Warwickshire county council, for one-half of Nuneaton and Bedworth council, and for one-third of Rugby council.

The main contest here will be in Nuneaton and Bedworth which is currently on a knife-edge.  The ruling Labour group has 17 seats - half of the council - with the Conservatives on 14, the Greens on 1 and two independents (who were elected for the Conservatives).  This is one of the handful of councils which renew half of their members at every election, so the last local elections here were in May 2018 - and a repeat of those results would see the Conservatives gain six seats and a comfortable majority to go with their lead in the Nuneaton parliamentary seat.

The good Conservative result in Nuneaton in May 2018 was also seen at the Warwickshire county elections in May 2017 and allowed the Tories to gain overall control of the county hall in Warwick.  The 2017 elections in Warwickshire returned 36 Conservatives, 10 Labour, 7 Lib Dems, two Greens and two localist independents.  Labour will need to do a lot better in Nuneaton to force a hung council here.

Rugby council has a small Conservative majority which looks safe enough.  A repeat of the 2019 results would see just one seat change hands, the Conservatives picking up the rural Dunsmore ward from an independent councillor.

<h2>West Midlands</h2>

<h3>Mayor of the West Midlands</h3>

Both of the West Midlands metropolitan areas' major elected officials will be up for election this year.  On paper the mayoralty is the more interesting position, as this was very close in 2017.  The first count gave Conservative candidate Andy Street, a former head of the John Lewis Partnership, a 42-41 lead over Birmingham Labour MP Siôn Simon; Simon got slightly more transfers, but it wasn't enough to take the lead in the runoff which Street won by 50.4-49.6, a majority of 3,766 votes across the county.

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

By contrast the West Midlands police and crime commissionership has always been safe for Labour.  This post has been held by Michael Jamieson since he won a by-election in 2014.  At the 2016 election Jamieson was less than a thousand votes short of being re-elected in the first round, polling 50% against 26% for the Conservatives and 17% for UKIP; in the final reckoning he beat the Conservative candidate 63-37.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

As in 2019, Dudley council is the West Midlands borough to watch.  This currently stands at 35 Labour councillors, 34 Conservatives, two independents and one vacancy; the Conservatives have a minority administration, and the casting vote of the mayor helps in that.  This year the ward map is in the Tories' favour; the 2016 results here had Labour winning 14 wards, the Conservatives 9 and UKIP 1, while in 2019 the Conservatives won 13 wards to Labour's 11.  That would suggest that the Conservatives should be favoured for an overall majority here.

The Tories already have a majority in Walsall, although only a thin one: 31 councillors against 26 Labour, two Lib Dems and an independent.  Again, this year the ward map is in their favour: a repeat of the 2019 results would see the Conservatives gain 3 Labour wards and all 3 of the seats held by other parties.

A sterner test for the government party will be to see whether they can make any headway in Sandwell.  This is the Black Country council which includes the two West Bromwich constituencies, both of which were Tory gains in December 2019; however, the last three Sandwell council elections have returned 72 Labour councillors out of a possible 72.  Judging from the May 2019 results the Tories should have their eyes on gaining Blackheath ward, but anything else looks a very tall order.

On the far side of Birmingham, the Conservatives have suddenly found themselves in trouble in Solihull where their majority is down to 26 seats out of 51.  The opposition here is an unlikely one: it's the Green Party, who have broken through in some of the bourgeois ex-Liberal parts of Solihull proper <em>and</em> the tower blocks of Chelmsley Wood and Castle Bromwich.  A repeat of the 2019 results would see the Conservatives lose Castle Bromwich ward to the Greens, and their majority on the council would go with it.

The Labour majorities in Coventry and Wolverhampton are impregnable.  There are no local elections this year in Birmingham.

<h2>Staffordshire</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

The Staffordshire PCC position has been held since 2012 by the Conservatives' Matthew Ellis.  In 2016 Ellis led the first round rather narrowly with 36% against 31% for Labour and 16% for UKIP; he increased his lead in the final round, but only to 53-47.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

There are elections this year for the whole of Staffordshire county council and for one-third of Cannock Chase and Tamworth councils.  There are no local elections this year in Stoke-on-Trent.

Staffordshire county council has had a large Conservative majority since 2009, when the ruling Labour group crashed from 32 seats to just 3.  The local Labour party has never really recovered from that experience, although they didn't do quite as badly in the 2017 election which returned 51 Conservatives, 10 Labour and an independent.  Any Labour recovery would need to start in Cannock, Tamworth and Newcastle-under-Lyme, and pre-pandemic results from Newcastle do not give much indication of that happening.  What about Cannock and Tamworth, though?

Well, Labour do retain Cannock Chase council, but only as a minority after losing overall control in 2019.  Going into these elections there are 17 Labour councillors, 15 Conservative seats (one of which is vacant), 2 Lib Dems and 7 others, most of whom were originally elected for the Green Party.  More than half of the Labour group is up for re-election this year, and a repeat of the 2019 results would see the Conservatives become the largest party here.

And there's not much sign of a Labour revival in Tamworth either.  The Conservatives have had a large majority here for a long time now - currently 21 seats against 5 Labour, 2 UKIP and 2 independents.  A repeat of the 2019 results would see the Conservatives gain one seat each from Labour and UKIP.

<h2>West Mercia</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

The West Mercia police area covers three counties in the Severn and Wye valleys in the west of England: Worcestershire, Shropshire and Herefordshire.  The 2012 PCC election returned an independent candidate, Bill Longmore, who didn't seek re-election in 2016.  Five years ago the Conservatives topped the poll here with 33% against 21% for Labour, 17% for UKIP and 14% for an independent candidate; the Conservatives' John-Paul Campion and Labour's Daniel Walton went through to the runoff, which Campion won 60-40.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

There are elections this year for the whole of Shropshire council and Worcestershire county council and for one-third of Redditch and Worcester councils.  There are no local elections this year in Herefordshire or Telford and Wrekin.

To start in Redditch, which like Tamworth is a quasi-New Town with voting patterns to match.  The Conservatives run Redditch council with an 18-11 lead over Labour, and no fewer than seven of the Labour councillors are up for re-election this year.  A par score for the Tories here would involve significant gains.

Worcester city council is currently hung: the Conservatives have 16 seats, Labour 15, the Greens 3 and the Lib Dems 1.  An all-party administration is in place.  The Conservatives will have their eye on gaining the city-centre Cathedral ward which they won two years ago, but the second gain they require for an overall majority may prove elusive.

Worcestershire county council has a big Conservative majority and that looks unlikely to change.  The 2017 election here returned 40 Conservative councillors, 10 Labour, 3 Lib Dems, 2 Greens, 1 Kidderminster Health Concern and an independent.

The ruling Conservative group on Shropshire council attracted rather a lot of bad publicity over the last decade, although the last term does seem to have been significantly quieter on that front.  The Tories are defnding a large majority from the 2017 election which returned 49 Conservatives, 12 Lib Dems, 8 Labour (all from Shrewsbury and the satellite village of Bayston Hill), three independents, a Green councillor and a representative of Kidderminster Health Concern (in Cleobury Mortimer, for which Kidderminster is the main service centre).

<h2>Gloucestershire</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

The post of Gloucestershire PCC has been held since 2012 by retired senior police officer Martin Surl, who was elected in 2012 and 2016 as an independent candidate.  At the 2016 election Surl led in the first round with 41%, to 35% for the Conservatives and 24% for Labour; the Labour transfers broke heavily for Surl who won the run-off by the comfortable margin of 59-41.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

There are elections this year for the whole of Gloucestershire county council and Gloucester and Stroud councils, and for one-half of Cheltenham council.

Gloucestershire county council was a Conservative gain in 2013 and has a relatively small majority: there are 31 Conservative seats against 14 Lib Dems, 5 Labour, 2 Greens and one county councillor for the People Against Bureaucracy Group, a long-standing localist group based in northern Cheltenham.  With a number of Tory-held divisions across the county having small majorities, it won't take much of an unwind for a No Overall Control result.

Gloucester city council is in a similar position.  It last polled in 2016, when the Conservatives won 22 seats in Gloucester against 10 for Labour and 7 Lib Dems.  The ruling group has since lost a by-election to the Lib Dems and has two further vacancies; unfortunately one of these is an entry for the Councillors Behaving Badly file, because Conservative councillor Lee Hawthorne resigned after becoming one of the first people to be prosecuted under recently-enacted laws against upskirting.  Despite that scandal, the Conservative majority in Gloucester is probably stronger than it appears as most of their wards look fairly safe.

In Stroud district, which also last polled in 2016, the Conservatives are the largest party but the administration is a coalition of Labour, the Greens and the Liberal Democrats.  The Tories will have to improve their position here significantly to take over the council.  One-half of Cheltenham council is also up for election; this borough has a large Lib Dem majority which does not look in serious danger.

<h2>Avon and Somerset</h2>

<h3>West of England Mayoralty</h3>

It's metro mayor time again as we come to the mayoralty for the Bristol area, generally known as the West of England Mayoralty.  This is voted for by the voters of the city of Bristol and the districts of South Gloucestershire, and Bath and North East Somerset.  North Somerset, on the far side of the Clifton suspension bridge, is not included.

The inaugural election for this position turned in a fragmented result on the first count. The Conservatives' Tim Bowles led with 27% of the vote; Labour candidate Lesley Mansell placed second with 22%; former Lib Dem MP Stephen Williams finished third with 20%; independent candidate John Savage polled 15% and the Green Party 11%.  The Conservatives and Labour went through to the runoff, which Bowles won 52-48.

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

There is a wider electorate for the Avon and Somerset police and crime commissioner, whose remit covers the three boroughs in the West of England mayoralty, the Somerset county council area and the unitary district of North Somerset.  Since 2012 the PCC has been independent figure Sue Mountstevens, who in 2012 was the only police and crime commissioner to receive a vote from more than 10% of their electorate - such was the awful turnout in those comedy elections.  Things were different in 2016, when Mountstevens topped the poll in the first round with just 26% of the vote; Labour polled 24%, the Conservatives 19%, UKIP 9% and three other candidates all saved their deposits with 7% each.  Sue Mountstevens and Labour candidate Kerry Barker went through to the runoff, which Mountstevens won 54-46.  She is not seeking re-election.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

For some reason, Bristol has ended up with three major single-member elected posts.  As well as the Avon and Somerset Police and Crime Commissioner and the Mayor of the West of England, the Mayor of Bristol is up for re-election.  This is currently Labour's Marvin Rees who had a big win here in 2016; on the first count he led with 40% against 23% for the outgoing independent mayor George Ferguson and 14% for the Conservatives, and Rees increased his lead in the runoff to beat Ferguson 63-37 in the final reckoning.  Along with Rees' mayoralty, Labour are defending an overall majority of four seats on Bristol city council; in 2016 they won 37 seats against 14 Conservatives, 11 Greens and 8 Lib Dems.

There are no local elections this year in Bath and North-East Somerset, North Somerset or South Gloucestershire.  The scheduled election for Somerset county council has been postponed to 2022 due to the possibility of further local government reorganisation in the county.

<h2>Wiltshire</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

The Wiltshire PCC is Angus Macpherson of the Conservatives, who was re-elected for a second term in 2016 comfortably.  In the first round he had 47% of the vote against 23% for Labour and 16% for the Liberal Democrats; this lead was extended to 64-36 in the runoff.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

There are elections this year for the whole of Wiltshire council and one-third of Swindon council.

The present Wiltshire council dates from 2009 when the county's local government was reorganised and its district councils were abolished.  All three Wiltshire elections to date have returned Conservative majorities, with the party winning 68 seats out of a possible 98 in 2017.  Although new division boundaries make comparisons difficult, there's no real reason to expect a change of control here.

Instead attention within the county will focus on the town of Swindon.  This has a small Conservative majority that rests on a particularly good result in May 2019, when the Tories converted a 39.6-39.2 lead over Labour in votes into a 12-7 win in seats; this seat tally was impressive enough in its own right but was actually an improvement on the 11-8 Tory lead recorded on general election day in 2015.  This year Labour and the Tories are defending nine wards each, and a par score would be for the Conservatives to increase their majority on the council.

<h2>Dorset</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

The Dorset PCC since 2012 has been Martyn Underhill, a long-serving senior police officer who worked on (among other things) the Sarah Payne child murder investigation.  Underhill was elected in 2012 as an independent candidate, being re-elected in 2016; in the first round he had 38% of the vote to the Conservatives' 29% and UKIP's 17%, and in the runoff he defeated Tory candidate Andrew Graham 60-40.  Underhill is not seeking re-election.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

Following the reorganisation of Dorset's local government in 2019, there are no local elections in the county this year.  There are, however, two crucial by-elections to Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole council.

BCP, Canford Heath (LD); Commons (Ind)

<h2>Devon and Cornwall</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

The Devon and Cornwall PCC election turned in a close result in 2016.  Top in the first round was Alison Hernandez of the Conservatives with just 24%; Gareth Derrick of Labour was second with 23%; UKIP polled 17%, independent candidate Bob Spencer got 15% and former Lib Dem MP Richard Younger-Ross finished fifth with 12%.  Hernandez and Derrick went through to the runoff, and transfers from the other four candidates were very even which resulted in a Conservative win by 51.1-48.9, a majority of 3,794 votes.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

There are elections this year for the whole of Devon county council, Cornwall council and the Isles of Scilly council, together with one-third of Exeter and Plymouth councils.

Both the cities of Exeter and Plymouth have Labour majorities.  Labour control Plymouth with 30 seats out of 57; that majority might be in some danger judging solely from the May 2019 results, but the opposition Conservative group have suffered a major split and probably need to sort their own house out first before challenging for the council leadership.  The Labour majority in Exeter does not look in serious danger.

Exeter supplies the entire Labour group on Devon county council, which has a large and secure-looking Conservative majority.  Things are different over the Tamar in Cornwall, where the Conservatives are the largest party but the administration is a Lib Dem-Independent coalition.  There are major boundary changes in Cornwall with no fewer than 36 seats disappearing, which should shake things up quite a lot.  The tiny Isles of Scilly council is non-partisan.

There are no local elections this year in Torbay.

<h2>Norfolk</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

The Norfolk PCC is former Canadian diplomat Lorne Green.  In the 2016 election he was top of the first round with 28%, against 24% for Labour and 17% each for UKIP and the outgoing independent PCC Stephen Bett, who finished fourth in his re-election attempt.  The runoff saw Green beat the Labour candidate by 54-46.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

There are elections this year for the whole of Norfolk county council and for one-third of Norwich council.

Norfolk county council was hung in the 2013-17 term thanks to a very good UKIP performance in May 2013; this has since unwound and the 2017 election gave the Conservatives 55 seats here against 17 Labour, 11 Lib Dems and one independent.  It's difficult to see that changing, although the Green Party (which was wiped out here in 2017) will want to get back on the council.  The Green powerbase is in Norwich, whose whole council was up in 2019 on slightly-revised ward boundaries; that election gave 27 seats to Labour, 9 to the Greens and 3 to the Lib Dems, and none of the city's 13 wards look marginal so it will take a lot of effort for that seat count to change.

<h2>Suffolk</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

In the 2016 Suffolk easily re-elected the Conservatives' Tim Passmore as its police and crime commissioner.  On the first count Passmore had a big lead with 44% of the vote, against 25% for Labour and 17% for UKIP; his lead in the run-off against Labour was 62-38.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

There are elections this year for the whole of Suffolk county council and for one-third of Ipswich council.

Unlike its northern neighbour, Suffolk narrowly re-elected its Conservative administration in 2013 with a 39-36 lead over the opposition; however, by 2017 that Tory majority had disappeared in a series of poor by-election results.  The 2017 election marked a return to form for the Tories with 52 seats, against 11 Labour, 5 Lib Dems, 4 independents and 3 Greens.  Local elections in the county two years ago were not that promising for the Conservatives, who lost control of Babergh and Mid Suffolk districts and performed particularly poorly in the rural west of the county (the constituency of the health secretary Matt Hancock, although that underperformance probably wasn't his fault).  Despite that, there should be enough headroom for the Conservative administration to continue.

Despite having a Tory MP since December 2019, Ipswich council has a large Labour majority which looks in no serious danger, although a repeat of the May 2019 results would see Labour lose two seats.

<h2>Cambridgeshire</h2>

<h3>Mayor of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough</h3>

The most rural of the metro mayoralties set up to date is that for Cambridgeshire and Peterborough, which covers an area which is fast growing in population but still has a lot of green space (although quite a lot of that is fenland).  The inaugural mayoral election in 2017 saw the Tories' James Palmer lead in the first round with 38%, with 23% for the Lib Dems and 19% for Labour; Palmer and the Lib Dem candidate Rod Cantrill went through to the runoff, which Palmer won by the easy margin of 57-43.

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

A year earlier, the Cambridgeshire PCC election (which covers the same area) had a rather different result.  Conservative PCC Jason Ablewhite was re-elected for a second term, polling 36% in the first round against 31% for Labour and 17% for UKIP; on this occasion the run-off was Tory versus Labour, with Ablewhite prevailing by the narrower margin of 53-47.  Ablewhite resigned as PCC in November 2019 under something of a cloud, and his deputy has been acting in the role since then.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

There are elections this year for the whole of Cambridgeshire county council, for the whole of Cambridge city council on new ward boundaries, and for one-third of Peterborough council.

Cambridgeshire county council was a Conservative gain in 2017, with new division boundaries helping the party to 36 seats against 15 Lib Dems, 7 Labour councillors and 3 independents.   The Tories have since performed very badly in the south of the county: the Lib Dems won a majority in South Cambridgeshire district in 2018, weren't far off winning control of East Cambridgeshire in May 2019 and weren't far off taking the South Cambridgeshire parliamentary seat in December 2019.  Some of these trends were already evident in May 2017 (six of the 15 Lib Dem wins that year were in South Cambridgeshire district) so we shouldn't overstate the chance of major seat changes, but the Tories must be looking at their majority with some concern.

Peterborough council is currently hung, with a minority Conservative administration on 28 out of 60 seats (two of which are vacant) supported by the 3 Werrington localist councillors.  A repeat of the May 2019 results would see the Conservatives lose three further seats and could result in Labour challenging for the council leadership.  Mind, Peterborough is a city that had three different MPs in 2019, which shows a volatile local political scene firmly in keeping with the events of that year.

Labour are firmly in control of Cambridge city council, where all 42 seats are up for election this year on slightly-revised ward boundaries.

<h2>Essex</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

The 2016 Essex PCC election was open following the retirement of Tory PCC Nick Alston.  New Conservative candidate Roger Hirst topped the poll in the first round with 33% of the vote, against 24% for former Conservative MP Bob Spink standing as the UKIP candidate, 20% for Labour and 13% for "Zero Tolerance Policing Ex Chief" Martin Terry.  Hirst and Spink went through to the runoff, with Hirst winning comfortably by 57-43.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

There are elections this year for the whole of Essex county council and for one-third of Basildon, Brentwood, Castle Point, Colchester, Epping Forest, Harlow, Rochford, Southend-on-Sea and Thurrock councils.

Essex is one of the safest county councils for the Conservatives.  The 2017 election returned 56 Conservative councillors against 7 Lib Dems, 6 Labour, 3 localists (2 from Canvey Island, the other from Loughton), 2 independents and a Green.

Instead attention within the county should focus on the districts and boroughs.  To start with England's oldest town, Colchester council is currently hung; the Conservatives are the largest party with 23 seats (including one vacancy) out of 51, but the administration is a coalition of the Lib Dems, Labour and an independent group which has a lock on Highwoods ward.  A repeat of the 2019 results would see that coalition increase its majority, with Stanway ward falling to the Lib Dems.

Moving to the towns on the north side of the Thames estuary, a similar rainbow coalition controls Southend-on-Sea council where the Conservatives are the currently the largest party on 20 seats out of 51.  The Tories did very poorly here in May 2019, carrying only four of the borough's 17 wards; they are defending eight seats this year so there is the potential for some large changes on this council.

Rochford council, based on Rayleigh and the rural area to the north of Southend, has a strong Conservative majority which can be expected to increase.  Castle Point council is stuck in a rut, with the Conservatives holding all the wards on the mainland in Benfleet and an independent group dominating offshore on Canvey Island; since Benfleet has more councillors than Canvey, this means a small but very stable Conservative majority.

Billericay and Wickford are covered by the large Basildon council where the Tories lost control in 2019; Labour and a number of independent groups are now running the show.  In 2016 Basildon returned three UKIP councillors, none of whom are still in the party; their respective wards returned one Conservative, one Labour and one independent councillor in 2019, so the Tories probably can't rely on a UKIP unwind here.

The UKIP factor was much larger in Thurrock in 2016.  The Kippers topped the poll across the 17 wards up for election that year with 39% of the vote, and won 6 wards; Labour polled 32% and won 4 wards, and the Conservatives won 7 wards despite coming in third in votes with just 28%.  Isn't England's first-past-the-post system wonderful?  A number of those UKIP councillors (after a "Thurrock Independents" interlude) have ended up in the Conservative group since the 2019 election, which has resulted in the Tories gaining (albeit by defection) a majority on Thurrock council for the first time since 2004-07.  Judging from the 2019 results, that majority could well be endorsed by the electorate this time round.

Brentwood has a rather small Conservative majority - 20 seats out of 37 - following a good Lib Dem performance in 2019, but the scope for further Conservative losses is limited as they are only defending six wards this year.  The Conservative majority in Epping Forest looks safe, as does the Labour majority in Harlow where the Tories have yet to make their dominance at parliamentary and county council level stick.  Harlow council currently has a 20-13 lead for Labour, who are defending 7 wards this year to the Conservatives' 4.

<h2>Hertfordshire</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

The Hertfordshire PCC since 2012 has been David Lloyd of the Conservatives.  He was re-elected in 2016, polling 42% against 27% for former Labour MP Kerry Pollard and 16% for the Lib Dems.  Lloyd's lead over Pollard in the final reckoning was 59-41.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

There are elections this year for the whole of Hertfordshire county council and for one-third of Broxbourne, North Hertfordshire, St Albans, Stevenage, Three Rivers, Watford and Welwyn Hatfield councils.

The only of those which looks completely safe for the Tories is Broxbourne, based on the towns of Cheshunt and Hoddesdon in the Lea Valley.  The A1/East Coast Main Line corridor is another matter entirely.  The Conservatives lost their majority on Welwyn Hatfield council in 2019, but still run the district as a minority with 23 seats against 13 Labour and 12 Lib Dem councillors.  If the 2019 election is repeated the Tories would lose three of the ten wards they are defending and fall further from overall control.  Similar considerations apply in the North Hertfordshire district, which is based on Hitchin, Letchworth and Royston; however, here the 22-strong Conservative group is in opposition to a coalition of Labour (16) and the Lib Dems (11).  Stevenage council has had a Labour majority continuously since the 1974 reorganisation and that will not change this year.

Following a Tory bloodbath in 2019 St Albans council is tied, with the Conservatives and Lib Dems both on 24 seats; the balance of power is held by 5 Labour councillors, 4 independents and a single Green councillor.  Since then the Lib Dems have gained the St Albans parliamentary seat after decades of trying.  A repeat of the May 2019 results would result in four Lib Dem gains (mostly from the small parties), which would make their present minority administration more secure.  The Liberal Democrats are more firmly in control of Watford (where they hold the elected mayoralty) and the Three Rivers district which wraps around the western side of Watford.

The county council has a large Conservative majority at present (51 councillors against 18 Lib Dems and 9 Labour) but there are enough marginal divisions for this majority to be in some real danger, given the change in the polls since May 2017 and the poor Conservative performance in 2019.

<h2>Bedfordshire</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

In the 2016 police and crime commissioner elections Bedfordshire was the only police area which the Conservatives gained from Labour, whose win in 2012 had been rather surprising.  Former TV presenter and journalist Kathryn Holloway topped the poll in the first round with 37% against 35% for outgoing Labour PCC Olly Martins and 12% for the Lib Dems; in the runoff Holloway won by 51.6-48.4, a majority of 2,883 votes.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

There are no local elections this year in Bedfordshire.

<h2>Thames Valley</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

The Thames Valley is one of the largest of England's police areas, covering the counties of Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire to the north-west of London.  The PCC since 2012 has been Anthony Stansfeld, a Falklands veteran and Conservative representative.  In the 2016 PCC election Stansfeld led in the first round with 40% against 33% for Labour and 15% for the Lib Dems, winning the run-off over Labour by the relatively small margin of 54-46.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

There are elections this year for the whole of Oxfordshire county council, the whole of the new Buckinghamshire council, the whole of Oxford council on new ward boundaries, and for one-third of Cherwell, Milton Keynes, Reading, Slough, West Oxfordshire and Wokingham councils.

To start in Buckinghamshire, which holds its first local elections since May 2017 following a reorganisation of the county's local government.  The new council has carried over the electoral divisions from the old Buckinghamshire county council, which four years ago returned 41 Conservative councillors against an opposition of four Lib Dems (all from Aylesbury), three independents and a single Labour councillor.  The new unitary council will be three times the size of the old county council, so for a par score those numbers should be scaled up accordingly.

The other Buckinghamshire local authority is for the New City of Milton Keynes, whose council is very politically balanced; the ruling minority Labour group has 22 seats (one of which is vacant) against 19 Conservatives (including two vacant seats), 15 Lib Dems and an independent.  The Conservatives lost five seats here in May 2019, but that actually outperformed expectations given that they were defending ten marginal wards; the ward map this year is much more friendly to the Tories, and a repeat of the 2019 results would see them gain three seats from Labour and become the largest party.

The Conservatives did pretty poorly in the 2019 Oxfordshire council elections, but that underperformance was concentrated in the districts south of Oxford.  The Tory vote generally held up better in Cherwell district, based on Banbury and the fast-growing town of Bicester; a repeat of the 2019 results would see them lose one seat in Bicester and two seats in the Oxford satellite town of Kidlington, but that won't significantly threaten the Conservative majority on the council.  Similar considerations apply in West Oxfordshire district, where the Conservatives are defending four wards (mostly in Witney town) which voted for the opposition in 2019; however they will have to do worse than that for the district to fall into No Overall Control.

There has been no Conservative local government presence for many years in the city of Oxford, where the whole council is up for election this year on revised ward boundaries.  Oxford is, of course, more than just dreaming spires; there's a significant technological and manufacturing base to the city's economy, and that produces a safe Labour council.

That Tory underperformance in Oxford cost them a majority on Oxfordshire county council in both 2013 and 2017, the latter election resulting in 31 Conservative councillors against 14 Labour, 13 Lib Dems, 4 independents and a localist from Henley-on-Thames.  The Conservatives rely on three of the independent councillors for overall control.  It will be interesting to see whether the party's poor May 2019 performances in the Vale of White Horse (Abingdon and Wantage) and South Oxfordshire districts are repeated, or indeed whether there is a renewal of the Lib Dem-Green electoral pact in that latter district.

Berkshire county council disappeared in the 1990s, but three of its former districts are holding elections.  In the county town of Reading, where boundary changes have been deferred until next year, Labour have a strong majority on the council and got a rare swing in their favour in the Reading East constituency at the 2019 general election.  The Reading East constituency includes a large amount of territory which is part of the town's urban area but administered separately as part of the Wokingham district; this is a council where the ruling Conservatives have been underperforming throughout the last electoral cycle, and a repeat of the 2019 results would see the Lib Dems gain five seats here and wipe out the Tory majority.  Finally, the Labour majority on Slough council is in no danger whatsoever.

There are no local elections this year in Bracknell Forest, West Berkshire or Windsor and Maidenhead.

<h2>Hampshire</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

Hampshire's police and crime commissioner elections have been unusually interesting, with the inaugural contest in 2012 won by independent candidate Simon Hayes who defeated former Conservative MP Michael Mates.  For the 2016 election the Tories changed candidate to Michael Lane, whose 29% of the vote was enough for a big lead in the first round.  A four-way pileup for the other place in the runoff was won by Labour candidate Robin Price on 16%, ahead of outgoing independent PCC Hayes who finished third with 15%; close behind were the Lib Dems and UKIP on 14% each.  The runoff between Lane and Price resulted in an easy Conservative gain with a 64-36 margin.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

There are elections this year for the whole of Hampshire county council and the Isle of Wight council, for the whole of Basingstoke and Deane council on new ward boundaries, for one-half of Fareham and Gosport councils, and for one-third of Eastleigh, Hart, Havant, Portsmouth, Rushmoor, Southampton and Winchester councils.

To take the big one first, Hampshire county council has a long-standing and strong Conservative majority, the 2017 election returning 56 Conservative councillors against 19 Lib Dems, 2 Labour councillors (both from Basingstoke) and one councillor from the Community Campaign in Hart district, of which more later.  The 2017 election also saw the Tories gain overall control of the Isle of Wight council after four years of independent-led administration; Wight returned 25 Conservative councillors, 11 independents, 2 Lib Dems and one councillor each from Labour and the Greens.  There have been no local elections on the Isle of Wight since then.

The districts which face Wight across the Solent are an interesting bunch.  To start at the eastern end, Havant council was a rare bright spot for the Conservatives in the May 2019 elections: the party was defending every seat up for election that year, and did so successfully.  The Tory majority there is under no danger.  Things were different over the water in the city of Portsmouth which was taken over by a minority Lib Dem administration; the most recent breakdown has 17 Lib Dems, 15 Conservatives, 6 Labour and 4 others (all of whom were elected on one of the above tickets).  A repeat of the 2019 results would see the Lib Dems lose some ground: they are defending Eastney/Craneswater ward which voted Conservative in 2019, and St Jude ward which voted Labour in 2019.  The Tories will also have their eye on the Labour seat in the volatile estates of Paulsgrove ward.

Over the water again, the Tories are defending a majority of two seats on Gosport council.  This has bizarre voting patterns: in the 2019 election the Conservatives polled 52% of the vote across the district to the Lib Dems' 23%, but the Tories and Lib Dems won eight wards each.  A repeat of those results would result in two Conservative losses and No Overall Control.  To reach the rest of the country from Gosport you have to pass through Fareham district, whose Conservative majority is under no danger.  The Lib Dem majority on the neighbouring Eastleigh council is even more impregnable.  The only Labour-controlled local authority in Hampshire is Southampton city council, where Labour have a 30-18 majority over the Conservatives; a repeat of the May 2019 results would see the Conservatives gain three seats nett.

Moving to the M3 corridor of inland Hampshire, the Tories performed very poorly in 2019 in Winchester district which now has a Lib Dem majority.  Although the district does include a large rural area around the city, the Winchester Conservatives will be doing well if they can stem further losses.  All the seats on the Basingstoke and Deane council are up for election on new ward boundaries; this district is currently hung, with 28 Conservatives forming a minority administration against 13 Labour councillors, 10 independents and 7 Lib Dems.  Hart district (based on Fleet and Yateley) is run by a coalition of the Liberal Democrats and the aforementioned Community Campaign, and that coalition's majority is in no danger unless the electoral pact between them breaks down.  The Conservatives will remain in control of Rushmoor district, based on the aerospace and military towns of Aldershot and Farnborough.

<h2>Surrey</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

If you thought the Conservatives could never lose a county-wide election in true-blue Surrey, think again.  It happened as recently as November 2012, when the first Surrey police and crime commissioner election was won by "Zero Tolerance Policing Ex Chief" candidate Kevin Hurley.  For the 2016 election the Conservatives got their act together, and their Surrey PCC candidate David Munro led in the first round with 35% against 18% for Hurley, 13% for the Lib Dems and 12% for Labour.  Munro and Hurley went through to the runoff which Munro won by the wide margin of 63-37.

For the 2021 election the Conservatives have deselected David Munro in favour of Lisa Townsend.  Munro has not taken this well, and is seeking re-election as an independent.  Zero Tolerance Policing Ex Chief Kevin Hurley is also trying to get his old job back.  The Lib Dems have selected Mole Valley councillor Paul Kennedy, and train driver and Labour candidate Howard Kaye completes a five-strong ballot paper.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

There are elections this year for the whole of Surrey county council and for one-third of Elmbridge, Mole Valley, Reigate and Banstead, Runnymede, Tandridge and Woking councils.

The 2019 local elections were generally horrific for the Tories in Surrey, with the party losing more than 100 councillors across the county - 60 of them in Guildford and Waverley districts alone.  In Guildford the Conservatives have a chance to recover from that with three local by-elections.  They are defending the Army-dominated Pirbright ward, which was the safest Tory ward in the district in 2019 but where the previous Tory councillor, Gordon Jackson, had gone independent before resigning from the council; Keith Witham is the defending candidate.  Friary and St Nicolas ward, covering Guildford town centre, was safe Lib Dem in 2019 and is defended by their candidate Cait Taylor.  Send ward, between Guildford and Woking, has been held since 2015 by the Guildford Greenbelt Group and gave that party 71% of the vote in 2019; Guida Esteves is their defending candidate.

There are two other standalone by-elections in Surrey to mention.  One of these arises out of the death in January 2020, at the horribly young age of 33, of a luckless man called Sam Kay.  Readers may remember a controversy from 2009 involving the quartet from Corpus Christi College, Oxford, memorably captained by Gail Trimble and including Kay, which won the final of that year's series of <em>University Challenge</em>.  Now, when your columnist did <em>UC</em> in the 2002-03 series it was made clear in the selection meeting that, because of the timing of the series recordings, final-year students were not eligible.  Kay was a final-year student at the start of the series, but was intending to stay on at Oxford by applying for a PhD.  That fell through.  By the time the quarter-finals and later stages were recorded, Kay had left Corpus and found work as an accountant, but he still took part in the recordings in breach of the series rules.  After the final was broadcast news of this got out, and the programme-makers Granada disqualified Corpus and stripped them of their title.  Whether you agree with that decision or not, the fault ultimately lay with Sam Kay.

Regrettably, Sam Kay's local government career didn't last much longer than his reign as a <em>University Challenge</em> champion.  He had been elected in May 2019 as a Liberal Democrat member of Surrey Heath council representing the town of Bagshot, beating the alphabet to top the poll and riding the anti-Tory wave in that election.  Kay's death leaves the local Lib Dems with a tricky defence in a marginal ward in Michael Gove's constituency.  Richard Wilson is the defending Lib Dem candidate, opposed in a straight fight by the Tories' Mark Gordon.

The other standalone by-election comes over the river in Spelthorne district, based on Staines-upon-Thames and one of the few parts of Middlesex that escaped incorporation into Greater London in the 1960s.  The Conservatives lost a large majority here in the 2019 election and now run the district as a minority; one of the wards which fell was Staines South ward, which returned two Liberal Democrats and one Labour councillor.  You get the impression that the opposition parties didn't see this result coming, as the Lib Dems finished with a big lead in votes but only had a slate of two for the three available seats.  Over the last two years Spelthorne council has suffered a number of defections and regroupings, including Lib Dem Staines South councillor Nichola Cornes who went independent and then resigned from the council altogether.  For the resulting by-election Rob Millist is the defending Lib Dem candidate, Harriet Digby stands for Labour and Sinead Mooney for the Conservatives.  The sort of defection level seen in Spelthorne often indicates a slightly dysfunctional council, and this political dysfunctionality may soon be joined by financial dysfunctionality.  Spelthorne council has invested massively in commercial property in recent years: their position is rather different to that of Croydon, who have made similar investments and run out of money, in that Spelthorne's portfolio is mostly generating rent, but whether the buildings are still worth what the council paid for them is another matter.

Of the Surrey councils holding elections by thirds this year, Mole Valley council (based on Leatherhead and Dorking) flipped straight to the Liberal Democrats in 2019; Elmbridge council (outer London suburbia around Weybridge and Walton-on-Thames) was taken over by a coalition of the residents groups and Lib Dems; while in Tandridge (the eastern end of the county, including Caterham and Oxted) and in Woking the Conservatives now have to rely on independent councillors for control.  In those areas, the primary focus for the Surrey Conservatives must be to stop the rot.  So far as Elmbridge is concerned, the Conservatives may be helped by what appears to be a breakdown in the Residents/Lib Dem pact: most of Elmbridge district is covered by the Esher and Walton parliamentary seat where the Lib Dems came close to knocking out foreign secretary Dominic Raab in December 2019, and the party appears to be trying to build on that success by contesting several Resident-held marginal wards.

The Tories do still retain overall control of Reigate and Banstead council (the M23/Brighton Line corridor) and the Runnymede district at the northern end of the county.  All of the seats on those councils were up in 2019 with new ward boundaries, and there don't appear to be many opportunities for opposition parties in the seats up for election there.

One interesting question will be whether these May 2019 underperformance feeds through to Surrey county council.  However, given that the Tories won 61 seats out of a possible 81 here in May 2017, it will take a lot for that majority to disappear.

<h2>Sussex</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

There was little of interest in the 2016 election for Sussex police and crime commissioner, which easily re-elected Conservative PCC Katy Bourne.  In the first round she led with 42% against 22% for Labour and 16% for UKIP; the run-off against Labour produced a Tory majority of 62-38.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

There are elections this year for the whole of East Sussex and West Sussex county councils, for one-half of Adur and Hastings councils and for one-third of Crawley and Worthing councils.  There are no scheduled local elections this year in Brighton and Hove.

The stand-out one of these to watch is Crawley.  This New Town got new ward boundaries in 2019 putting all 36 council seats up for re-election; in vote terms there was a photofinish with the Tories and Labour polling 42.6% each across the borough, while in seat terms Labour eked out a win by 19 to 17.  Since then two Labour councillors have died and two more have left the party, which has left the Conservative group holding half of the seats; a highly unusual situation has developed, with the Conservatives declining to seek control of the council for themselves and instead shoring up the Labour administration in advance of these elections.  Control of Crawley council is likely to come down to a handful of votes in one or more wards.

Things are on the other foot in the south coast resort of Worthing where Labour have made strong gains over the last electoral cycle.  Worthing council currently stands at 23 Conservative councillors against 10 Labour, 3 Lib Dems and a UKIP councillor; nearly half of the Tory group is up for re-election this year, and a repeat of the 2019 results would result in five Labour gains and a sharply-reduced Conservative majority.

The Tories have much less margin for error in the neighbouring Adur district, based on towns such as Shoreham on the coastal strip between Worthing and Brighton; they currently hold 16 seats (one of which is vacant) out of a possible 29.  Adur last went to the polls in 2018, and a repeat of those results would see the Conservatives gain two seats with UKIP wiped out.

The Conservative majority on West Sussex county council is in no danger.  East Sussex county council is however more balanced, with the 2017 election returning 30 Conservatives against 11 Lib Dems, 5 independents and 4 Labour councillors.  Since then the Tories have performed pretty poorly in the 2019 local elections in Bexhill-on-Sea and the 2018 local elections in Hastings, where all of the Labour county councillors come from.  One-half of Hastings council is up for election this year, and the Labour majority there looks safe.

<h2>Kent</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

Our final English PCC election is for the county of Kent, which returned independent candidate Ann Barnes as its first police and crime commissioner in 2012.  Barnes retired in 2016 and the first round of the election to replace her saw Matthew Scott of the Conservatives top the poll with 33%.  Second with 27% was UKIP candidate Henry Bolton, who subsequently had his fifteen minutes of fame as leader of that party.  Labour's Tristan Osborne finished third with 19% of the vote, while independent candidate Gurvinder Singh Sander polled 10%.  Last of the six candidates that year was Steve Uncles of the English Democrats, who polled 3% and lost his deposit; Uncles was subsequently sent to prison for seven months for electoral fraud in the 2013 Kent county council elections, having submitted seven sets of nomination papers for English Democrats "candidates" who either hadn't consented to their nomination or never existed in the first place.  The run-off for the 2016 Kent PCC election was Conservative versus UKIP, with Scott beating Bolton by 54-46.

Matthew Scott is seeking re-election, and is opposed this time by two other candidates: Lola Oyewusi (who is also standing for the county council, in Sittingbourne South) for Labour and Graham Colley for the Lib Dems.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

There are elections this year for the whole of Kent county council and for one-third of Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells councils.  There are no local elections this year in the Medway towns.

Tunbridge Wells was extensively discussed by this column at the end of last year, as the 2019 local elections saw the Conservatives lose 13 of the 18 seats they were defending, and save one other seat on the toss of a coin following a tied result in Paddock Wood West ward.  To cut a long story short, a lot of that was down to proposals by the council for a new civic centre/theatre/underground car park complex which went down with the locals with, for want of a better word, disgust.  That cunning plan has since fallen by the wayside, but the ruling Conservatives will have to rebound a heck of a lot from last year's performance to hold onto their council majority.

Maidstone council is hung and likely to remain so; a Lib Dem-Independent administration is currently in place.  Maidstone is also home to Kent county council, whose Tory majority shouldn't be in danger.  The county council candidate lists have revealed a mistake by Labour who have managed to nominate two candidates for the Malling Central division (based on East and West Malling together with Larkfield off the M20 motorway); mind, Labour only polled 5% there in 2017 so this probably won't cost them a seat.

The Conservative revival in the polls in late 2019 saw its first fruits on 17th October that year with a by-election gain in the Westcourt ward of Gravesham (<em>Andrew's Previews 2019</em>, pages 323 and 329), a downmarket residential area in eastern Gravesend.  That Westcourt poll was the first council by-election the Conservatives had gained from Labour in over a year.  Well, we are back here again for a crucial local by-election to Gravesham council; if Labour lose this one as well, their council majority will go with it and they will be down to half of the seats.  Karina O'Malley defends this Westcourt by-election for Labour, Samir Jassal challenges for the Conservatives.

The Conservatives have three other local by-elections to defend in western Kent.  In the Darent valley there are by-elections to Dartford council from Darenth ward (Maria Kelly defending) and from the cumbersomely-named neighbouring ward of Wilmington, Sutton-at-Hone and Hawley (Ellenor Palmer defending).  In Sevenoaks council the Tories defend a by-election in Brasted, Chevening and Sundridge ward, covering villages immediately to the west of Sevenoaks at the south-east corner of the M25 (Keith Bonin defending).  None of these look in any danger.

East Kent's by-elections have a rather left-wing bias to them.  The by-election-prone Beaver ward in the south of Ashford town comes to the notice of this column for the fourth time in ten years, following the death of one of the Labour councillors; Dylan Jones is the defending Labour candidate for a ward that should be safe enough for them.  In Dover district Labour defend Mill Hill ward, the western of the four wards covering Deal: Jeffrey Loffman is the Labour candidate here in a ward that had good showings in 2019 for both the Conservatives (who have selected David Hawkes) and the Greens (Mike Eddy).

We finally get around to the by-election in the Newington ward of Thanet which I previewed all the way back on 19th March 2020 but which was pulled by the returning officer due to the pandemic; all four candidates who were nominated in that poll have returned, with Mary King favoured to hold for Labour.  Newington ward is in Ramsgate as is Central Harbour ward, which split its three seats between Labour and the Greens in 2019; confusingly, the defending Labour candidate has the name David Green, while the Greens have selected Tricia Austin.  Over in Margate we have a by-election in the Dane Valley ward which is defended by the Thanet Independents, the main remnant of the UKIP group which won a majority on Thanet council in 2019.  Dane Valley voted Conservative in 2007, Labour at a December 2009 by-election and in 2011, then UKIP in 2015 before splitting its three seats in 2019 between the two Thanet Independents candidates and Labour, with the Tories close behind.  All three candidates for this Dane Valley by-election will feel they have realistic chances of winning: Mark Websper defends for the Thanet Independents, Martin Boyd is the Labour candidate, David Wallin stands for the Conservatives.

Further along the north Kent coast Labour defend the town of Sheerness, where they have held two out of three council seats since the current ward was introduced in 2015.  The other seat went to UKIP in 2015 and to an independent candidate in 2019, so this by-election could be tricky to hold given the presence of a candidate from the Swale Independents council group.  Nicola Nelson is the Labour candidate, Dolley White stands for the Swale Independents.

The only Conservative by-election defence in East Kent is the Swalecliffe ward of Whitstable, after Ian Thomas - who represented the area on both Canterbury council and Kent county council - took his own life after being arrested on suspicion of sexual assault.  The by-election is for Canterbury council only, and the defending Conservative candidate is Mark Dance.

In Canterbury proper we have a by-election for the city-centre Westgate ward.  This was the destination point for many pilgrimages to the shrine of Thomas Becket over the centuries, so it's fitting that our tour of England's local by-elections on 6th May 2021 ends here.  Since it was redrawn in 2015 Westgate ward has returned councillors from all three main parties, with a Labour gain from the Conservatives at a by-election on 8th June 2017 presaging the Labour gain of the parliamentary seat later on that election night.  The 2019 poll here returned one Lib Dem and two Labour councillors, with the Conservatives now out of the running here.  Pip Hazelton defends for Labour, Alex Lister will try to gain for the Lib Dems.

<h2>Wales</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioners</h3>

Most of the focus of the 2021 elections in Wales will be on the Senedd, and with good reason.  However, Wales also has four police and crime commissioners to elect.  The 2016 Welsh PCC elections, also held alongside a Senedd poll, saw quite a lot of change due to the fact that they were contested by Plaid Cymru, who hadn't stood in 2012.

Plaid ended up gaining two PCC positions.  One of those was North Wales PCC, covering the old counties of Clwyd and Gwynedd and thus not quite the same as the North Wales electoral region of the Senedd.  That position was open following the retirement of 2012 winner Winston Roddick, who had won that year as an independent candidate despite being a Lib Dem party member.  (Roddick's political career went all the way back to the 1970 general election, in which he was the Liberal candidate for Anglesey.)  In 2016 the North Wales police area gave 31% to Plaid Cymru candidate Arfon Jones, 26% to Labour candidate David Taylor, 20% to the Conservatives and 12% to UKIP; Plaid picked up a lot of transfers to win the runoff against Labour 58-42.  Arfon Jones is standing down after one term and is replaced as Plaid candidate by Ann Griffith, an Anglesey county councillor.  Labour have selected Flintshire councillor Andy Dunbobbin, the Conservative candidate is former Mayor of Ruthin Pat Astbury, and UKIP have not returned.

The 2012 election for Dyfed-Powys PCC had been a straight fight between the Conservatives and Labour, with the Tories' Christopher Salmon prevailing against former Welsh agriculture minister Christine Gwyther.  There was a wider field for the 2016 election, with Plaid Cymru candidate Dafydd Llywelyn leading the first count on 28% against 25% for Salmon, 19% for Labour and 11% for UKIP who narrowly beat the Lib Dems for fourth place.  In the runoff Llywelyn defeated Salmon by a 56-44 margin.  Llywelyn is seeking re-election against Conservative candidate Jon Burns (a former Welsh city and county councillor) and Labour's Philippa Thompson (a former diplomat who contested Preseli Pembrokeshire in December 2019).  Again, UKIP have not returned.

The two PCC positions in industrial south Wales were both safely Labour.  A three-cornered contest in Gwent saw Labour lead in the first round with 46% against 31% for the Conservatives and 23% for Plaid; Plaid's transfers gave Labour a 62-38 win over the Conservatives in the runoff.  Incumbent Labour PCC Jeff Cuthburt is seeking re-election; the Tory candidate is Iraq veteran Hannah Jarvis, and Plaid have selected Caerphilly councillor Donna Cushing.

In the South Wales police area (corresponding to the old county of Glamorgan) former First Minister Alun Michael was re-elected for a second term in 2012 without fuss.  Michael led in the first round with 41% of the vote.  A three-way contest for the other place in the run-off saw the Conservatives and Plaid poll 18% each with independent Mike Baker in fourth on 17%; the Tory candidate Timothy Davies finished second, just 29 votes ahead of Plaid (70,799 to 70,770).  That put Davies into the runoff, where he was duly crushed 68-32 by Michael.  Michael is seeking re-election for a third term; the Conservative candidate is Swansea councillor and former police officer Steve Gallagher; Plaid have selected criminal justice campaigner Nadine Marshall, whose son was murdered six years ago by a person who was on probation at the time; and independent Mike Baker is trying again.

It should be noted that the elections in Wales on 6th May have different franchises.  If you are aged 16 or 17, or you are resident in Wales but not a citizen of a Commonwealth or EU country, then you cannot vote for your Police and Crime Commissioner but you can vote for the Senedd and in any local by-elections.  Which we shall come to next.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

There are no local elections in Wales this year, but there are ten council by-elections taking place.  One of these is a direct result of COVID-19, which has taken from us Flintshire county councillor Kevin Hughes.  He had served since 2017 as an independent councillor for Gwernymynydd division, taking over an open seat after a long-serving Liberal Democrat councillor retired; the Lib Dems didn't put up a candidate to defend the seat, and Hughes picked it up with a 58-29 lead over the Conservatives.  Gwernymynydd is a village just south-west of Mold on the main road towards Ruthin, and the division includes a number of other hamlets to the south of Mold.  Kevin Hughes' son Andy is seeking to follow in his father's footsteps as an independent candidate, and is opposed only by Plaid Cymru's Bob Gaffey.

At the far end of North Wales there are two by-elections to the Isle of Anglesey council.  Seiriol division is the eastern end of the island, covering the town of Beaumaris and surrounding villages; Caergybi division is the town of Holyhead, and as such is on the front line of Brexit as the main port of embarkation for Dublin and Dún Laoghaire.  The Caergybi division split its three seats between two independents and a Labour candidate in 2017; the late councillor Shaun Redmond was the second independent candidate, gaining his seat from Labour.  Independent candidate Ken Evans will seek to succeed Redmond, as will Labour's Jennifer Saboor.  Seiriol returned a full slate of Plaid Cymru candidates in 2017 and looks safe enough for the party, whose defending candidate is Gary Pritchard.

The other seven by-elections are in the industrial south of the country.  Newport's Victoria division is on the east bank of the Usk immediately opposite the city centre; the division is centred on Rodney Parade, the home ground of the Pro14 rugby side Newport Gwent Dragons.  Victoria was the first division in Wales to elect a Muslim local councillor, Mohammad Asghar, who was returned here as a Plaid Cymru representative in 2004 and was subsequently elected to the Senedd on their ticket in 2007.  Asghar was still an MS at the time of his death last year, although he had defected to the Conservatives in 2011.  Victoria division is now safe for Labour, whose defending candidate is Farzina Hussain.  Christine Jenkins resigned over a year ago, and the Victoria by-election was originally due to take place in April 2020 as were a number of other by-elections listed in this section.

The old county of Mid Glamorgan has given us three by-elections which have all generated varying degrees of controversy.  Bridgend councillor David Owen has got his name into the Councillors Behaving Badly file after he was sentenced to three years' imprisonment in March 2020: he was found guilty of conspiracy to steal and handling stolen goods, in relation to the theft of an agricultural vehicle worth £9,000 from a farm in Abergavenny.  His resignation letter to the council was sent from his prison cell, shortly before he was due to be disqualified from office (this kicks in when the deadline for appeals expires, or once any appeal is disposed of).  Owen had served since 2012 as an independent councillor for Nant-y-moel division, at the head of the Ogmore Valley, and had beaten Labour 62-38 in 2017.  The Nant-y-moel by-election features an all-female ballot paper: new independent Mary Hughes is challenged by Labour's Lee-Anne Hill and the Tories' Clare Lewis.  In the large Rhondda Cynon Taf district, Conservative councillor Mike Diamond has fallen out with his former party and resigned as councillor for the Cardiff commuter area of Llantwit Fardre division, which is the only safe Tory division in the district; while the council's only member from the Cynon Valley Party, Gavin Williams, has been controversially disqualified under the six-month non-attendance rule, leaving a vacancy in the village with Wales' highest rates of child poverty according to official 2019 figures, Penrhiwceiber.  Labour still hold the other seat in Penrhiwceiber division.  Gavin Williams is seeking re-election in the by-election caused by his disqualification, this time as an independent candidate; Ross Williams will try to gain his seat for Labour.  The defending Conservative candidate in Llantwit Fardre is Sam Trask.

Over in Port Talbot, Labour have the tricky task of defending the Aberavon division under the shadow of the M4 motorway.  This is an electoral division of two parts, with the Aberavon and Baglan Moors areas divided from each other by the Neath Port Talbot Hospital and a large industrial estate.  Aberavon division was a stronghold of the continuing SDP into the twenty-first century, long after they had disappeared from the national scene; but the SDP are now extinct here and the division's three seats split two to Plaid Cymru and one to Labour in 2017.  Labour's Stephanie Lynch has the task of defending this by-election; Plaid's Andrew Dacey will look to gain.

Finally, Labour also have two by-elections to defend in the city of Swansea.  Castle division (in the Swansea West constituency) covers the city centre, while Llansamlet division (in the Swansea East constituency)  is in the north-east of the city and takes in the villages of Llansamlet and Birchgrove together with the Swansea Enterprise Park.  Both of these returned full slates of four Labour councillors in May 2017 and should be safe for the party's candidates: Hannah Lawson in Castle (which has a field of nine candidates) and Matthew Jones in Llansamlet.

<h2>Greater London</h2>

<h3>Mayor and Assembly</h3>

A quick mention of the biggest single election in the country.  The fifth Mayor of London election will grab a lot of the headlines; this was a Labour gain at the most recent poll in 2016 after Conservative mayor Boris Johnson stood down.  (Anybody know what happened to him after that?  Answers on a postcard to the usual address.)  The Labour candidate, then Tooting MP Sadiq Khan, led the Conservative candidate Zac Goldsmith by 44-35 in the first round, and increased that lead to 57-43 in the runoff (1,310,143 votes to 994,614).  The general expectation is that Khan should win a second term.

The Greater London Assembly is the only English elected body to use proportional representation.  In the 2016 election Labour polled 40% of the vote and won 12 seats; the Conservatives polled 29% of the vote and won 9 seats; the Greens and UKIP polled 8% and 7% respectively and won 2 seats each; and the Liberal Democrats won 1 seat with 6% of the vote, just coming in over the 5% threshold.  13 seats would be an overall majority, and if Labour can improve their list vote that could be in range.

The other main point of interest will come in Newham council, where a referendum will be held on whether to abolish the elected mayoralty and move to the committee system of governance.  This was not without controversy: a group looking to move back to the leader and cabinet model had put a petition in for a referendum to that effect, which was ruled out of order because it had been delivered during the middle of pandemic restrictions.  If the people of Newham decide to vote for a change in their governance, that would commence after the current Mayor Rokhsana Fiaz' term expires next year.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

There are forty-six local by-elections in the capital on 6th May, all of which are being dealt with by the London Elects team as part of the centralised Mayor and Assembly count.  This is being split over two days, with seven GLA constituencies due to declare on Friday 7th, and the other seven constituencies and the list votes to come in on Saturday 8th.  Accordingly, it may take some considerable time for these by-election results to come through after the poll.  It could be worse: Tower Hamlets could be running the show.

I'll go through these polls in an anti-clockwise direction, starting with two by-elections to Redbridge council.  Seven Kings ward has a name which has nothing to do with seven kings; it was originally something like "Sevekings", and as such probably referred to a settlement of people associated with a man called Seofoca.  This ward lies to the north of the Great Eastern railway line and Roman road, while Loxford ward lies to the south of those communication links on the east bank of the River Roding.  Both of these wards were over 75% Labour in the 2018 local elections, so quite why Chaudhary Mohammed Iqbal, elected on the Labour slate in Loxford, thought it was necessary to commit electoral fraud to get elected there is difficult to fathom.  Iqbal, who was living in Barking at the time of the election, had lied about his address on his nomination papers; he resigned from the council after pleading guilty to four criminal charges, and is now serving a 68-week prison sentence.  The defending Labour candidates are Sahdia Warraich in Loxford and Pushpita Gupta in Seven Kings.

The River Roding flows into the Thames estuary at Barking Riverside, which forms the Thames ward of Barking and Dagenham council.  Barking and Dagenham has had a full slate of 51 Labour councillors since 2010, and don't expect any change to that here: in 2018 Thames ward gave 83% of the vote to Labour in a straight fight with the Conservatives.  This time there is more choice for the wards' voters with five parties and an independent candidate standing; although the Tories have put up a high-profile candidate in the form of Andrew Boff, who stood here in 2014 and has contested the Hackney mayoralty on a number of occasions, don't bet against Labour candidate Fatuma Nalule.  The Thames ward is served by Dagenham Dock railway station, from which change at Barking for an Underground train to East Ham Central ward in the London Borough of Newham; similar considerations apply here, with Farah Nazeer as the defending Labour candidate.  The poor voters of East Ham Central will have five ballot papers to juggle: three for the GLA, this by-election and the Newham governance referendum.

Rather different in character is the remaining by-election east of the Lea, in the Hatch Lane ward of Waltham Forest.  This is the south-eastern of the three wards covering Chingford, a Tory holdout which returns Iain Duncan Smith to Parliament.  Hatch Lane was safe enough for the Conservatives in May 2018, and their defending candidate is Justin Halabi.

Waltham Forest is part of the North East constituency of the London Assembly along with two Middlesex boroughs which have turned up with a large number of by-elections.  There are four polls in Hackney, with Labour defending the trendy Hoxton East and Shoreditch ward on the edge of the City and also King's Park ward in the Lea Valley (the ward which includes the Hackney Marshes), both within the Hackney South and Shoreditch constituency.  Both of the vacating councillors have gone on to greater things: Tom Rahilly (King's Park) now has a politically-restricted job, while Feryal Clark (Hoxton East and Shoreditch, elected under her maiden name of Feryal Demirci) was elected in December 2019 as the Labour MP for Enfield North.  The wards are safe, and the defending Labour candidates are Anya Sizer in Hoxton East and Shoreditch, and Lynne Troughton in King's Park.

In the Hackney North and Stoke Newington constituency, we have two fascinating by-elections in the Hasidic enclave of Stamford Hill.  At the time of the 2011 census, Hackney's New River and Lordship wards both turned in a Jewish population of over 25%, ranking 12th and 13th of all the wards in England and Wales for Judaism.  Since 2011 Hackney's ward boundaries have changed; much of this area is now covered by the Woodberry Down ward (very safe Labour in 2018) and the Stamford Hill West ward (a Conservative gain from Labour in 2018).  Both of these wards have by-elections on 6th May.  In Woodberry Down the defending Labour candidate is Sarah Young, while Stamford Hill West sees Conservative Hershy Lisser challenged by Labour's Rosemary Sales.

Islington borough has outdone Hackney with five by-elections.  Bunhill ward runs from the northern edge of the City to the Angel, and takes in the Silicon Roundabout at Old Street underground station; St Peter's ward runs north-east from the Angel between Essex Road and the Grand Union canal; Mildmay ward is centred on the Overground station at Canonbury; Highbury West ward includes Arsenal football grounds old and new; and Holloway ward is based on the northern end of the Caledonian Road.  The Bunhill by-election is to replace controversy magnet Claudia Webbe, who was elected in 2019 as a Labour MP for Leicester.  Despite the presence of independent candidates in Bunhill and St Peter's standing on anti-Low Traffic Neighbourhoods tickets, none of these polls should give the defending Labour candidates (respectively Valerie Bossman-Quarshie, Toby North, Angelo Weekes, Bashir Ibrahim and Jason Jackson) any cause for concern.

Things are different in Enfield district where Labour are defending three by-elections.  Chase ward, the northernmost ward within the Greater London boundary, takes in some genuinely rural areas within the M25 motorway; Crews Hill railway station, on the Hertford Loop, links the ward to the centre of the Great Wen.  This ward has swung a mile to the left over the last two decades, although not far enough for Labour to consider the ward safe yet.  Chris James defends for Labour, Andrew Thorp is the Conservative candidate.  Also within the Enfield North constituency is Southbury ward straddling the Great Cambridge Road, which is safer for Labour; as is Jubilee ward, immediately to the south of Southbury and located within the Edmonton constituency.  Ayten Guzel and Chinelo Anyanwu are respectively the defending candidates.

Also on the northern edge of Greater London is the Edgware ward of Barnet, where the Northern Line terminates; included within this ward is the Scratchwood motorway service area on the M1, assuming that the guns of HMS <em>Belfast</em> (which are aimed at Scratchwood) haven't destroyed it yet.  This is a safe Conservative ward with a very large Jewish population; the defending candidate is Nick Mearing-Smith.  Barnet by-election watchers are more likely to be focused on the poll in East Barnet ward, to the east of the East Coast main line and served by Oakleigh Park and New Barnet stations; this was narrowly gained by Labour in 2014, but the Tories took of the ward's three seats back in a close 2018 result.  Labour candidate Linda Lusingu is defending the East Barnet by-election, the Tories' Nicole Richer will try to gain.

Another Labour-held marginal to watch is the Brent ward of Brondesbury Park in Willesden, which has returned slates from all three major parties in the last three local elections.  Labour gained this ward from the Conservatives in 2018 by the narrow margin of 45% to 43%.  Three by-election results in Brent in January 2020 were very poor for Labour, but things may have changed since then.  Gwen Grahl defends for Labour, Sapna Chadha will try to gain for the Conservatives.  Also keep an eye on the Churchill ward of Westminster city council; located at the southern end of Westminster either side of Grosvenor railway bridge, this ward includes the Victoria coach station and Chelsea Barracks but is based on Churchill Gardens, a highrise postwar housing estate on the far side of the river from Battersea Power station.  As with East Barnet, Churchill ward was Conservative up to 2010, voted Labour in 2014, and split its three seats two to Labour and one to the Conservatives in 2018.  If Labour can repeat their good December 2019 result in the local Cities of London and Westminster constituency, this by-election should be a comfortable hold for them.  Labour's Liza Begum is challenged by the Conservatives' Shaista Miah.

Moving into west London, we come to three by-elections in the Ealing borough.  Two of these are caused by Conservative councillors being elected to Westminster: Alex Stafford (of Ealing Broadway ward) is now the MP for Rother Valley in Yorkshire, Joy Morrissey (of the neighbouring Hanger Hill ward, running from North Ealing underground station to the notorious Hanger Lane gyratory) has taken on the task of representing Beaconsfield in the Commons.  Both of these should be safe Conservative holds for Julian Gallant and Fabio Conti respectively.  Labour should just as easily defend Hobbayne ward, which runs north from Hanwell station on the Great Western main line to Ruislip Road East; their candidate here is Louise Brett.

Further out we come to the Charville ward of Hillingdon borough, a perennial marginal in Hayes to the north of the Uxbridge Road.  Unusually for a London ward, Charville has swung to the right over the last two decades: it returned a full slate of Labour councillors in 2002 and a full Conservative slate in 2018, with split representation at the three elections in between.  Defending Tory candidate Darran Davies, who got himself into trouble during the campaign for some offensive stuff on his Facebook, is challenged by Labour's Steve Garelick.

Mrs Gaskell's charming literary village of Cranford is located (checks notes) at the eastern end of the Heathrow Airport runways within the borough of Hounslow, and its economy is dependent on the airport - not good news at the moment.  Poonam Dhillon was one of the local residents who once drew a wage from services related to air travel (in her case, catering); in January 2021 she died from COVID-19, aged 58, during her third term as a councillor.  The by-election to replace her takes place at the same time as another by-election to Hounslow council, in the neighbouring Hounslow Heath ward.  Both of these are safe for Labour, whose candidates are Devina Ram and Madeeha Asim respectively.

Our final by-election north of the river takes place in Hampton Wick ward, across the water from Kingston upon Thames.  This ward in the borough of Richmond upon Thames was safe Conservative up to 2014, when the councillors elected on the Tory slate here included Tony Arbour and Tania Mathias.  Arbour is a veteran of local government who was first elected to Richmond council as far back as 1968, won one of the last by-elections to the Greater London Council in 1983, and has represented the South West constituency of the London Assembly since the establishment of the Assembly in 2000.  (He retires from the Assembly this year.)  Mathias was elected in 2015 as the MP for the local Twickenham constituency, defeating cabinet minister Vince Cable; she promptly resigned from Richmond council, and the resulting by-election surprisingly went to the Liberal Democrats.  This was a harbinger of things to come: Richmond upon Thames was comprehensively taken over by the Liberal Democrats at the 2018 election.  A number of wards in that election saw joint slates of Lib Dem and Green Party candidates, and Hampton Wick was one of them; this by-election is one of them, and this by-election is caused by the resignation of Hampton Wick's Green councillor Dylan Baxendale.  He won the final seat in 2018 with a majority of 98 votes over Tony Arbour, a long way behind the Lib Dem slate.  This one looks interesting, particularly as the Lib Dems are standing a candidate.  Chas Warlow defends for the Greens, Petra Fleming challenges for the Lib Dems, Nina Watson stands for the Conservatives.

If Richmond's by-election is interesting, the by-election in Kingston upon Thames looks bizarre.  This is in Chessington South ward, the salient of Greater London between Esher and Epsom.  Chessington South is safe Lib Dem, and the by-election has come about due to the resignation of their councillor Patricia Bamford who has topped the poll here in every election this century.  Her son Charles Bamford is contesting the by-election - for the Labour Party, while the former Labour MP for Thurrock Andrew Mackinlay (who was a Labour member of Kingston council many years ago) is also contesting the by-election - as the defending Liberal Democrat candidate.  This may be the constituency of the Lib Dem leader Ed Davey, but Chessington South ward also contains the pub run by the Official Monster Raving Loony Party's deputy leader Jason "Chinners" Chinnery, and Chinners has recruited not one, not two, but <em>thirteen</em> OMRLP candidates for this by-election.  I suppose it's possible that all those Loonies might end up splitting the vote.  Overall the ballot paper has nineteen candidates, which must be a record for a single-member local by-election.

Labour have a seat to defend in each of the boroughs of Merton and Wandsworth.  The Merton by-election is in Merton's half of the St Helier estate; this ward has had a few by-elections in previous years (<em>Andrew's Previews 2016</em>, page 81; <em>2017</em>, page 196) which have given Labour no trouble, and neither should this poll.  Helena Dollimore defends.  The Wandsworth seat is vacated by Fleur Anderson, who scored the only Labour gain from the Conservatives in December 2019 by winning the Putney constituency; her former Bedford ward is in the Tooting constituency, named after the Bedford Hill and including much of Tooting Common.  Anderson gained her council seat from the Conservatives in 2014 alongside Rosena Allin-Khan, who now represents Tooting in Parliament.  Bedford ward swung further to Labour in 2018 to return a full Labour slate for the first time, but the defending Labour candidate Hannah Stanislaus shouldn't forget that when it comes to local elections Normal Rules Do Not Apply within the borough of Wandsworth.

The troubled finances of the London Borough of Croydon will not be helped by having to organise five council by-elections this May.  Two of these are due to the resignations of the former Labour council leader Tony Newman and former finance cabinet member Simon Hall, on whose watch the borough ran out of money.  Newman and Hall, who are suspended from the Labour party, have respectively vacated Woodside ward (south-east of Norwood Junction station) and New Addington North (the northern half of the isolated quasi-New Town of New Addington).  Labour are also defending a by-election in South Norwood ward (west of Norwood Junction station), while the Tories have seats to defend in Park Hill and Whitgift ward (south-east of Croydon town centre) and Kenley ward (on the road and railway lines towards Warlingham and Caterham on the southern edge of Greater London).  None of these should give the defending parties much cause for concern in ordinary course, although with the special circumstances that apply in Croydon at the moment there is the potential for some big swings.  The defending Tory candidates are Ola Kolade in Kenley and Jade Appleton in Park Hill and Whitgift, while the Labour candidates for New Addington North, South Norwood and Woodside are respectively Kola Agboola, Louis Carserides and Michael Bonello.  Independent candidate Mark Samuel, a regular fixture in Croydon local by-elections who sometimes achieves the dizzy heights of ten votes, put in nomination papers for all five by-elections but was only allowed to contest one: he has chosen Woodside ward.  Croydon council have recently received a petition for a mayoral referendum, which will be held over until the autumn.

Greenwich and Lewisham have turned up with four by-elections each, all of them Labour defences.  In Lewisham, promising young Labour councillor Tom Copley is now a Deputy Mayor of London in Sadiq Khan's administration, while Joe Dromey (the son of Jack Dromey and Harriet Harman) has also taken up a new job which is politically restricted.  They have vacated Sydenham and New Cross wards respectively.  There also by-elections in the south of the borough in the Bellingham ward (for more on which see <em>Andrew's Previews 2016</em>, page 133) and the neighbouring ward of Catford South.  All of these were safe for Labour in 2018.  The defending Labour candidates are Rachel Onikosi in Bellingham, James Royston in Catford South, Samantha Latouche in New Cross and Jack Lavery in Sydenham.

Turning our attention to Greenwich, a mention is due to the first Muslim to become a UK local council leader.  Mehboob Khan led the Labour group on Kirklees council in West Yorkshire from 2003 to 2014, and was leader of that council from 2009 to 2014.  In 2015 he resigned from Kirklees council and transferred to Greenwich, taking over the seat in Greenwich West ward vacated by the newly-elected Greenwich and Woolwich MP Matthew Pennycook.  Khan has now taken a politically-restricted job and accordingly a by-election needs to be held in Greenwich West.  This is the core of historic Greenwich, taking in the town centre, the Royal Naval College, Greenwich Park and the old Observatory building, whose position defines the Greenwich Meridian of 0 degrees longitude.

The by-election in Greenwich's Glyndon ward, covering the area between Plumstead and Woolwich, is less savoury.  Tonia Ashikodi, who won a by-election here in May 2016 and was re-elected on the Labour slate in 2018, had accepted a council house in the borough in 2012 without revealing that she was the owner of three other properties.  She was found guilty of two charges of fraud by false representation, and in March 2020 she resigned from the council after being given an 18-month suspended sentence.  A by-election was immediately called to replace her but the pandemic intervened before it could be held, and Ashikodi's dishonesty has meant her council has had a vacant seat for over a year.

The other two Greenwich by-elections are both Labour defences, in the wards of Kidbrooke with Hornfair and Shooters Hill along the Roman road towards the Channel ports.  On paper, none of these should give Labour any cause for concern.  The defending Labour candidates are Sandra Bauer in Glyndon, Pat Slattery in Greenwich West, Odette McGahey in Kidbrooke with Hornfair, and Clare Burke-McDonald in Shooters Hill.

The final two by-elections in London are both the result of councillors moving on to greater things.  Conservative councillor and London Assembly member Gareth Bacon was elected in 2019 as the MP for Orpington, and he has vacated his Bexley council seat in Longlands ward (the western end of Sidcup).  Labour councillor Marina Ahmad is contesting and is favourite to win the Lambeth and Southwark constituency in this year's London Assembly elections, and she has resigned her Bromley council seat in Crystal Palace ward.  These should be safe defences for their respective parties' candidates: Lisa-Jane Moore for the Conservatives in Longlands, Ryan Thomson for Labour in Crystal Palace.

<h2>Scotland</h2>

<h3>Local elections</h3>

Scotland's returning officers have efficiently filled all the vacancies which arose last year.  The Scottish Parliament election for 2021 is combined with just one local by-election, in the <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i18544">Forth and Endrick</a> ward of Stirling council.  This is a large rural ward with no towns to speak of, located about 20 miles north of Glasgow beyond the Campsie fells.  The eastern bank of Loch Lomond, the Munro of Ben Lomond and the village of Drymen lie within the boundaries of the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park, while the ward extends east down the Forth valley as far as Gargunnock.  It's part of the Stirling constituency at both Holyrood and Westminster level.  The Stirling Holyrood seat has been SNP-held since 2007, but the Conservatives carried this ward in 2017 with a 45-30 vote lead and a 2-1 seat lead over the SNP.  The ward's SNP councillor Graham Lambie has died, and the Conservatives (who are the largest party on Stirling council, but in opposition to an SNP/Labour administration) are in a good position to gain a seat here.  The defending SNP candidate is Paul Goodwin, while Jane Hutchison challenges for the Conservatives.

<h2><em>In memoriam</em></h2>

The last year has, of course, been a terrible time for everyone.  I would like to pause here to remember and to pay tribute to the local councillors who have left us over the two municipal years since May 2019.  Some of these people were veterans of local government, some only just beginning their careers in our council chambers; in some cases their friends and colleagues left behind can reflect on a long life well lived, in others we mourn those who passed before their time.  Some of these names have already appeared in this column over the last two years; but in too many cases, the pandemic has left insufficient space for their stories to be told here.  Where I have included a picture in the list below, that signifies that the councillor was reported to have died of COVID-19.
