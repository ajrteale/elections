"All the right votes, but not necessarily in the right order"
</blockquote>

Well, you have to start somewhere.  Welcome to Andrew's Previews' countdown to the May 2021 elections, which promise (in that hazy, faraway fantasy called the future) to be one of the biggest electoral events of this Parliament.  The whole of Great Britain is due to go to the polls.  And there's not just one type of election involved: many voters will have two, three or (in some cases) four ballot papers to juggle, and multiple electoral systems abound.  It's complicated.

For this reason there will be a long series (quite a long series) of Preview pieces.  I'm going to start by setting out the scene in the north-east of England.  Here we have up for election the police and crime commissioners for Northumbria, Durham and Cleveland; the Mayors of the Tees Valley and North Tyneside; and elections for a third of the five Tyne and Wear boroughs and the whole of Northumberland, Durham and Hartlepool councils.

<h2>Comparisons</h2>

The hybrid nature of the May 2021 elections means that any comparison is inevitably going to be confusing.  There are two different baselines to consider.

Most of the posts up for election next year were last filled in 2016, which was a very close set of local elections in England: the BBC's Projected National Share put Labour on 31%, the Conservatives on 30%, the Lib Dems on 15% and UKIP on 12%.  In the Scottish Parliament, the SNP gained vote share but lost its overall majority; the party has been running Holyrood as a minority since.  Labour fell short of a majority in the National Assembly for Wales (as it was then), but stayed in power with the support of the single Liberal Democrat member.  Sadiq Khan gained the London mayoralty for Labour following the retirement of Boris Johnson who had chosen re-enter politics on the national stage, with some success.  Finally, the second set of Police and Crime Commissioner elections saw a bonfire of many of the independents who had been elected on comedy turnouts in November 2012.

May 2016 was very much another time, and by May 2017 things were very different.  This set of local elections came slap-bang in the middle of Theresa May's snap election campaign, and very much in her honeymoon period.  The BBC's Projected National Share had an eleven-point Conservative lead, with 38% against 27% for Labour and 18% for the Liberal Democrats.  With 2017 being (in England) essentially a county council year, and with UKIP having done well in the 2013 county elections, that resulted in big seat gains for the Conservatives who gained Derbyshire from Labour and won majorities in Cambridgeshire, East Sussex, Gloucestershire, Lancashire, Lincolnshire, Norfolk, Suffolk, Warwickshire and the Isle of Wight.

So, let's break down the country into its police areas and see what's going on.

<h2>Northumbria</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

Vera Baird, the former Labour MP for Redcar, was Northumbria PCC from 2012 until 2019 when she resigned to become Victims' Commissioner for England and Wales.  The resulting by-election, held in July 2019, saw Labour's Kim McGuinness, a Newcastle upon Tyne city councillor, take the lead on first preferences: 38%, against 22% each for two Northumberland councillors, independent candidate Georgina Hill and Conservative Robbie Moore; the Lib Dems coming in fourth and last with 19%.  Having placed second narrowly ahead of Moore, Hill got into the runoff and picked up most of the transfers, meaning that McGuinness was elected in the final reckoning by the narrow margin of 52-48.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

The whole of Northumberland county council is up for election along with one-third of the seats in the five Tyne and Wear boroughs and the elected mayoralty of North Tyneside.

The Conservatives almost won an overall majority in Northumberland in May 2017.  Their 12 net gains, for a total of 33 seats, were mostly due to a collapse by the Lib Des who lost all their seats in the Berwick upon Tweed constituency.  However, the Conservatives did also gain two seats in Cramlington (one of them from Laura Pidcock, who subsequently had an ill-starred Parliamentary career in North West Durham) and tied for first place in the South Blyth division whose Lib Dem councillor was re-elected on the returning officer's drawing of lots.  This was a sign of things to come: Cramlington and Blyth are both in the Blyth Valley constituency which was the first Conservative gain of the December 2019 general election.  With 33 seats against 24 for Labour, 7 independents and 3 Lib Dems the Conservatives formed a minority administration, although they're a man down at the moment after Robbie Moore (their candidate in the Northumbria PCC by-election) was elected in December as MP for Keighley.  His seat in Alnwick is vacant.  Laura Pidcock's father died in 2019; he was a Northumberland councillor, and Labour held the resulting by-election in Holywell division.

<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/sunderland19.png" />

The largest of the five Tyne and Wear boroughs is another early declarer: the city of Sunderland.  This column wrote in 2019 that Sunderland has a Labour administration which is very locally unpopular while also having a very secure majority, and despite the fact that Labour lost 12 councillors in 2019 that's still true.  The Labour group currently has 51 seats (one of which is vacant), against 12 Conservatives, 8 Lib Dems, 3 UKIPpers and 1 Green.  There are 10 wards with split representation and Labour are defending every single one of them; but for the party's majority to be in serious danger they'd have to do far worse even than in 2019.

<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/newcastletyne19.png" />

Things are much more secure for Labour in the other four Tyne and Wear boroughs.  In Newcastle upon Tyne the party has 54 seats (four of which are vacant) against 20 Lib Dems and four independents and localists.  A repeat of the 2019 results would see Labour lose three seats: North Jesmond and Ouseburn to the Lib Dems, and Callington and Throckley ward to the localists.

<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/ntyneside19.png" />

North Tyneside is different to the other four Tyne and Wear boroughs in that it has an elected mayor.  The mayoralty has been held by both Labour and the Conservatives in the past with a number of very close results, but the last mayoral election in 2017 had a big lead for Labour's Norma Redfearn who was re-elected in the first round with a 56-31 lead over the Conservatives.  Labour hold 51 of the 60 seats on the council (one of which is vacant) against 7 Conservatives, a Lib Dem and an independent; a repeat of the 2019 results would see the Conservatives gain Cullercoats and Tynemouth wards from Labour, but Labour would gain Monkseaton North from the Conservatives and also pick up the Lib Dem seat in Northumberland ward.  In the event that the Conservatives gain the mayoralty, it's likely that the new mayor will have to cohabit with a Labour-majority council.

<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/gateshead19.png" />

Gateshead is a borough where very little seems to change from election to election.  There are currently 52 Labour seats (one of which is vacant) against 12 Lib Dems and two independent councillors who were elected on the Lib Dem ticket.  One of the defectors (in Whickham South and Sunniside) is up for re-election next year.  A repeat of the 2019 results would result in no change to the Labour total.

<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/styneside19.png" />

South Tyneside, on the other hand, had some excitement in the 2019 elections where Labour lost five seats, four to independents and the other (Beacon and Bents ward, covering South Shields town centre) to the Green Party.  In 2016 Labour won a clean sweep of all 18 wards, some of which may prove tricky to defend; although with 47 seats out of a possible 54 it is impossible for the party to lose its majority here.

<h2>Durham</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

Ron Hogg, who had led the English police response against football hooliganism during the 2002 FIFA World Cup in Japan and South Korea, had been the Durham PCC since 2012.  Hogg died in December 2019 and his deputy, Steven White, is serving as PCC in an acting capacity until an election can be held.  Hogg had been re-elected in the first round in 2016, defeating the Conservatives 64-24.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2017/durham17.png" />

There are whole council elections this year for Durham council.  The last elections here were in 2017 and left Labour with a reduced majority.  They won 74 seats against 25 for various categories of independents and localists, 14 for the Liberal Democrats (who are particularly strong in Durham city), 10 Conservatives and 3 seats for the North East Party, a regionalist movement with a powerbase in the New Town of Peterlee.  None of the ten Conservative councillors were elected in the North West Durham constituency, which the party now holds in Westminster.  There have been six by-elections since 2017, with Labour holding three, the Lib Dems holding one and (in May 2019) gaining Shildon and Dene Valley from Labour, and a very fragmented by-election in Spennymoor in May 2019 which saw an independent candidate finish in first place with just 19% of the vote, succeeding a different independent.

There are no local elections this year in Darlington, but that borough will take part in the Tees Valley mayoral election discussed in the next section.

<h2>Cleveland</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

The Cleveland PCC since 2012 has been Labour's Barry Coppinger, a Labour man who had previously sat on Middlesbrough council.  Having already announced his retirement, Coppinger resigned as PCC in 2020 and his deputy has taken over for the rest of his term.  Coppinger was re-elected in 2016 with a 62-38 lead over the Conservatives in the runoff.

<h3>Tees Valley mayoralty</h3>

The Tees Valley mayoral election the following year told a completely different story.  The electorate here consists of the four Cleveland boroughs plus Darlington, and the addition of Darlington made all the difference.  Ben Houchen, who had previously been leader of the Conservative group on Stockton-on-Tees council, was elected as the first Mayor of the Tees Valley by the narrow margin of 51.1% to 48.9% over Labour in the runoff, having led 39.5-39.0 on first preferences.  With the Conservatives having gained three seats here in December 2019 (plus the Sedgefield constituency, part of which is in Darlington borough), and with local elections across the area since 2017 having been dire for Labour, Houchen must be fairly confident about the prospect of re-election.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/hartlepool19.png" />

The only council in Cleveland holding ordinary local elections this year is Hartlepool, where local politics has been bizarre for many years and seems to have got more so since the Monkey Mayor left the scene.  All simian and indeed human life is here, and the council membership is the broadest of broad churches with members from the Socialist Labour Party at one end of the political spectrum, the For Britain Movement at the other end and representatives of nearly every viewpoint in between.  The Scargillite group is in fact the former Labour council leadership following a split in early 2019; that split and six seat losses for Labour in May 2019 means that the town is now in the hands of a group which was originally called the Independent Union, before affiliating to the Brexit Party, before leaving the Brexit Party and becoming the Independent Union again.  They are running the show in alliance with those obvious political bedfellows the Scargillites and the Conservatives.  The usual medicine for political basket cases like Hartlepool is to hit the reset button with an all-out election, and as luck would have it the Local Government Boundary Commission were in town recently so there will be an all-out election in 2021 on new ward boundaries.

<h2>Cumbria</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

The Cumbria PCC position has been held by the Conservatives since 2012.  Peter McCall, a former Army officer who commanded a squadron during the Bosnian war, has served since 2016.  On the first count he had 34% of the vote against 24% for Labour, 17% for the Lib Dems and 15% for an independent candidate; in the runoff McCall defeated the Labour candidate by 58-42.
