Six by-elections on 12th August 2021, three in England and three in Scotland:

<h2>Inverness West; and<br/>Wick and East Caithness</h2>

Highland council, Scotland; caused respectively by the resignations of indeepndent councillors Graham Ross and Nicola Sinclair.

Welcome to the far north.  We start with two by-elections to the Highland council, which (using the standard European area metric) sprawls across 0.84 Belgiums at the northern end of Great Britain.  This area is mountainous and extremely sparsely populated, with most of the Highland Council's 235,000 or so constituents concentrated in the city of Inverness and other towns.

Around a tenth of the Highland council's residents live in the historic county of Caithness, a generally low-lying area which includes one of Europe's largest boglands, the Flow Country.  Most of Caithness' residents live in the two burghs of Thurso and Wick, leaving the rest of the county essentially empty.  On the coast between Thurso and Wick can be found the traditional northeastern corner of Great Britain, the village of John o'Groats from where ferries

161 railway miles fom Wick, and a rather shorter distance along the A9 trunk road, lies the commercial and administrative capital of the Highlands: the city of Inverness.  The Inverness West ward covers the city's western residential suburbs: Balnafettach and Clachnaharry on the western side of the Caledonian Canal, and Ballifeary between the canal and the River Ness.

Politically, the Highlands are an area where the candidate often matters more than the party label.  Political trends in the rest of the UK reverberate less strongly here when general elections come around; and local elections have traditionally been dominated by independent candidates to the point that they often went uncontested.  The introduction of PR for Scottish local elections in 2007 put a stop to unopposed elections here, meaning that everybody had something to vote for, and it also broke the independent stranglehold on the council chamber in Inverness.  At the last Scottish local elections in 2017 the Highlands' electors returned 28 independent councillors, 22 SNP, 10 Conservatives, 10 Lib Dems, 3 Labour and a Green.  The main independent group still leads the council, but they rely on a coalition with the Lib Dems and Labour for overall control.

Inverness West ward dates from the introduction of PR in 2007 and was redrawn in 2017.  Its three ordinary elections to date have all returned one independent, one Lib Dem and one SNP councillor.  The Lib Dems won a by-election in April 2009 for a seat previously held by an independent councillor, but didn't defend their gain in 2012.  In May 2017 the SNP topped the poll with 29% of the first preferences, the Lib Dems had 28%, independent councillor Graham Ross was re-elected with 21%, and the Conservatives finished as runner-up with 12%.  If we recount the votes for one seat, the Lib Dems finish top with a convincing 61-39 lead over the SNP.

The 2017 boundary changes cut the size of Highland council from 80 councillors to 74, and the big loser in the redistribution was Caithness which went down from ten councillors to eight.  Previously the burghs of Thurso and Wick had formed separate wards with a Landward Caithness ward covering all the rural villages; following the reduction the Landward Caithness ward was split up, with its southern and eastern parts being added to Wick ward to form a new ward called Wick and East Caithness.

The previous Landward Caithness ward was dominated by independent candidates, and going into the 2017 election it had a full slate of four independent councillors following a by-election gain from the SNP in November 2013: the winning SNP candidate was forced to resign from the council after it came out that he had gone over the expense limit in the 2012 election.  Wick ward started off with independent dominance too, but an SNP gain in an April 2011 by-election broke the mould; the new SNP councillor, Gail Ross, was re-elected in 2012 at the top of the poll with 46% of the vote.

Ross didn't seek re-election in 2017, and the first election for the new Wick and East Caithness ward returned to independent dominance, with five independent candidates polling 62% of the vote between them.  Top of the poll was Willie Mackey, outgoing councillor for Landward Caithness ward, who polled 22% of the vote and was elected on the first count.  Also elected on the first count was new independent candidate Nicola Sinclair, who polled 21%.  Another Sinclair on the ballot was Andrew Sinclair of the Conservatives, who polled 14% and won the third seat.  Raymond Bremner of the SNP (12%) narrowly defeated Neil Macdonald (9%), the outgoing Labour councillor for Wick ward, for the fourth and final seat.

So, for the same council we have two very different wards over a hundred miles apart geographically and almost as far apart politically.  The by-election in Wick and East Caithness has arisen due to the resignation of independent councillor Nicola Sinclair, the chair of Highland council's Caithness committee, who is going back to her previous career in local journalism.  In this connection she has written <a href="https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/news/highlands/3328573/theres-a-highland-council-by-election-on-the-horizon-heres-what-the-wick-and-east-caithness-candidates-are-promising-to-deliver/">this article (link)</a> for the <em>Press and Journal</em> on the candidates to succeed her on the Highland council.

For the Wick and East Caithness poll you might fancy the independent candidate on previous form, and there is only one defending independent candidate here.  He is Bill Fernie, who was a long-serving independent councillor for Wick West ward from 2003 to 2007 and then for Wick ward from 2007 to 2017.  Fernie topped the poll in Wick in 2007 with 30% of the vote, but his star has fallen somewhat since then; he scraped in on the final count in 2012, and in 2017 he polled 7% in this ward and was eliminated in sixth place.  The Conservative candidate Daniel Ross was given a large interview in the local paper (<a href="https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/news/county-has-been-unfairly-treated-by-highland-council-claims-245213/">link</a>), calling for devolution to Caithness in full "glumly pointing at potholes" mode.  Most of Ross' fire was trained on the SNP, who have selected Michael Cameron.  Also standing are Jill Tilt for the Liberal Democrats (who represent Caithness at Westminster) and Libertarian candidate Harry Christian.

The Inverness West by-election is also an independent defence following the resignation of Graham Ross, the deputy provost of Inverness.  Ross had served since 2012, and is leaving the council for family reasons.  Again, there is one independent candidate to replace him: Duncan McDonald, who is semi-retired after a 34-year Army career in the Royal Logistics Corps.  The SNP have selected Kate MacLean, who works for the NHS as a community development officer.  The Lib Dem candidate is 25-year-old Colin Aitken, a native Canadian who moved to the Highlands in 2015.  Another young candidate is the Conservatives' Max Bannerman.  Completing a ballot paper of seven candidates are Iain Forsyth of the Independence for Scotland Party, Libertarian Calum Liptrot and Ryan Mackintosh of the Scottish Greens.  The usual Scottish disclaimers apply: Votes at 16 are in force and the Alternative Vote applies, please fill out your ballot paper in order of preference.

<h2>Dalry and West Kilbride</h2>

North Ayrshire council, Scotland; caused by the resignation of Scottish National Party councillor Joy Brahim.

For our remaining Scottish by-election we move to a ward which covers a large chunk of rural Ayrshire.  Dalry (pronounced Dal-RYE, for those who weren't aware) is an industrial town on the main railway line from Glasgow to Ayr and the A737 road towards Paisley; a bypass road has recently been opened.  The main industry here back in the day was ironworking; today a large employer is the DSM chemical factory, improving the health of the nation by producing vitamins.

This would no doubt have pleased the 1st Lord Boyd-Orr, who grew up in the small town of West Kilbride on the Firth of Clyde coast.  He was briefly an MP, representing the Combined Scottish Universities from an April 1945 by-election to 1946.  John Boyd Orr was the first Director-General of the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, a position which followed on from a career doing important scientific research in nutrition.  In 1949 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.  Boyd-Orr was one of eleven British winners of that prize, eight of whom have served in the House of Commons: the other three are the 1976 winners Mairead Corrigan (now Maguire) and Betty Williams, and the 1977 winner Amnesty International.

West Kilbride has also given us Nicola Benedetti, a classical violinist who was born here in 1987 and whose musical career has blossomed since she won the BBC Young Musician of the Year award in 2004.  This column isn't always appreciative of string players, but Benedetti can certainly play.  Here she is in action, inspiring the next generation of musicians and music lovers.

But this area's main export has traditionally been nut music but energy of some form or another.  Just up the coast from West Kilbride is Hunterston, home to two nuclear power stations (one closed 1990, the other about to cease generation) and a port through which raw materials were imported into the UK for the Ravenscraig steelworks and our coal-fired power stations.  With Ravenscraig long gone and coal-fired power stations about to go the same way, the Hunterston terminal's coal-handling facilities are now being demolished.

Dalry and West Kilbride ward also has a large rural element, so it's not a strong left-wing area.  Its first election, in 2007, returned independent councillor Elizabeth McLardy, Robert Barr for the Conservatives and John Reid for Labour.  Barr successfully sought re-election as an independent candidate in 2012, when Reid lost his seat to the SNP's Catherine McMillan.

There was a clearout here in the 2017 election, as the SNP's McMillan stood down and independent McLardy lost her seat to the Conservatives after polling 8% and finishing in sixth place.  The new SNP candidate Joy Brahim topped the poll with 24%, the Conservatives returned Todd Ferguson with 22%, and independent Robert Barr was re-elected with 19%.  A second independent, Kay Hall, was runner-up with 12%, and Labour crashed to 8%.  The five independent candidates polled 46% between them, and if we rerun the count for one seat then it goes to Robert Barr, who leads Brahim by 56% to 44%.

Across North Ayrshire council the SNP and Labour tied for first place on 11 seats each in the May 2017 election, despite the SNP polling 35% while Labour had just 26%.  There is a Unionist majority on the council (the other 11 councillors are 7 Conservatives and 4 independents).  Labour run the council as a minority, and they recently became the undisputed largest group after one of the SNP councillors walked off to join Alex Salmond's new Alba party.

The SNP's Joy Brahim is now working outwith Dalry, and she has resigned from the council.  To replace her the Nationalists have selected Robyn Graham; she is the national secretary of the SNP's youth branch YSI.  As with the two Highland by-elections above there is one independent candidate here: John Willis previously fought this ward in 2017, polling 27 first-preference votes and finishing in eighth and last place.  Standing for the Conservtives is Ronnie Stalker, who runs a butchers shop in Dalry.  The Labour candidate is Valerie Reid, who stood in 2017 as the second Labour candidate in Saltcoats ward.  Completing the ballot paper are the Lib Dems' Ruby Kirkwood, who stood in the local seat of Cunninghame North in the Scottish Parliament elections three months ago; and James McDaid of the Socialist Labour Party.  Whoever wins may have to move fast to seek renomination for the 2022 North Ayrshire elections, when there will be new boundaries and this ward will be broken up.

<h2>Grange</h2>

South Lakeland council, Cumbria; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Dave Khan.

We come down the coast into England to reach Lancashire over the Sands.  The town of Grange-over-Sands lies on the west bank of the Kent estuary, as it flows into the flat and dangerous sandbanks and mudflats and saltmarshes of Morecambe Bay.  This mini-riviera is a Victorian seaside resort, with the railway line over the estuary and around the bay to Lancaster being the main link with the outside world.  The railway runs along the coast next to a mile-long promenade, interrupted by the forlorn remains of the Grange Lido, an Art Deco open-air swimming pool which closed in 1992 and which the council may now be deciding to do something about.  The Grange ward extends to the west, beyond the town boundary, to take in the village of Allithwaite.

Grange-over-Sands was included within Cumbria in 1974, and now forms part of the South Lakeland district and the Westmorland and Lonsdale parliamentary constituency.  This is the last major holdout of Liberalism in north-west England: Westmorland and Lonsdale is the region's only Lib Dem parliamentary seat (held by the former party leader, Tim Farron), and South Lakeland is the only district in the region with a Liberal Democrat majority.  For now, at least; local government in Cumbria is up for reorganisation, and the current plan is for South Lakeland to merge with Eden and Barrow-in-Furness districts into a new council from 2023 onwards.

In advance of this plan the May 2021 county and district elections in South Lakeland were cancelled, but Grange ward went to the polls anyway in May as a by-election was held alongside the election for Cumbria Police and Crime Commissioner.  Grange-over-Sands is part of the Lib Dem majority in South Lakeland, and the Liberal Democrats held the by-election by the wide margin of 60-26 over the Conservatives.  The Grange division of Cumbria county council was safely Conservative when it was last contested in May 2017, but it has very different boundaries (the county division extends north as far as the eastern shore of Windermere).

This second Grange by-election of 2021 is the result of the resignation of Lib Dem councillor Dave Khan, who was their candidate for the county division in 2017.  He was narrowly elected for the Grange ward in 2018 (when the current boundaries were drawn up) and easily re-elected in 2019.

Defending for the Lib Dems is Fiona Hanlon, a singer and guitarist from Grange.  The Conservatives have selected Steve Chambers, who was runner-up here in 2018 just 63 votes behind Khan; Chambers is a businessman and former police officer from Allithwaite and a governor of Allithwaite primary school.  Also standing are Robin le Mare for the Green Party (who returns from May's by-election) and Patricia Wright for Labour.

<h2>Orwell and Villages</h2>

East Suffolk council; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Melissa Allen.

For our Conservative defence of the week we travel to rural Suffolk.  The Orwell and Villages ward covers the countryside between Ipswich and Felixstowe, from the Orwell estuary in the south to the Deben estuary in the north.  Anything coming in or out of Felixstowe - and there is a lot of that, because Felixstowe is one of the UK's largest container ports - has to traverse this ward.

The largest population centres in the ward are the twin villages of Trimley St Martin and Trimley St Mary, named after two different churches which share the same churchyard.  These are the last villages on the main road before Felixstowe, and they were bypassed in the 1970s.

This area is the southern end of the East Suffolk district which was established following a reorganisation in 2019; previously it was the southern end of Suffolk Coastal district.  The inaugural election for the current ward was close between the Conservatives and an independent slate led by Sherrie Green, a former Conservative councillor who had represented the Trimleys on Suffolk Coastal council.  Shares of the vote were 35% for the Conservatives, 31% for the independent slate and 21% for the Green Party.  The ward is split between two divisions of Suffolk county council, both of which were safe Conservative in May's election.

Defending for the Conservatives is Trimley St Mary resident and Felixstowe town councillor Mick Richardson, a former policeman and Police Federation rep who now runs a business flying drones.  The independent slate and the Greens have not returned, so Richardson is opposed for the vacancy by Michael Ninnmey of the Lib Dems and Labour candidate David Rowe; Rowe returns from May's county council elections, in which he stood for Felixstowe North and Trimley.

Parliamentary constituency: Suffolk Coastal
