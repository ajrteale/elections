Thirteen by-elections on Super Thursday, 16th December 2021, and we start with the big one:

<h2>North Shropshire</h2>

House of Commons; caused by the resignation of Conservative MP Owen Paterson.

Have I mentioned that the Welsh Marches are beautiful?  Well, the landscape of North Shropshire does test that proposition a bit.  Here we don't have the grandeur of the Beacons, the spectacle of the Wye Valley or even the rolling moorland of southern Shropshire.  North Shropshire is based on relatively high ground, with the boundary between the Dee and the Severn catchments running the length of the constituency; but this is generally a flat landscape of prime agricultural land.  You don't have to go far in North Shropshire to find fields full of crops or cows.

What the Marches do specialise in is tiny but attractive market towns, and we have five of them here.  The easternmost of them is Market Drayton, located midway between Shrewsbury and Stoke-on-Trent.  Market Drayton gave us Robert Clive, the man without whose work and dubious legacy India might never have become British; Clive was born nearby and attended the former Market Drayton Grammar School.

Market Drayton lies on the Shropshire Union Canal, the last great work of Thomas Telford, which runs south to the Black Country and north to the Mersey estuary.  Our next town also lies on major north-south routes: the A49 road between Shrewsbury and Warrington, and the railway line between Shrewsbury and Crewe.  Whitchurch advertises itself as the home of tower clocks: from 1790 to 2012 it was the home of J B Joyce, whose public clocks have been installed all over the world.  Joyce built what is reputed to be the second most-photographed clock in England, the Eastgate Clock on the Chester city walls; other Joyce clocks appear at locations as diverse as Birmingham University, Carnforth railway station, and the Shanghai Custom House.

Some miles to the south of Whitchurch lies Wem, on the old road and railway line from Whitchurch to Shrewsbury.  The childhood home of the Georgian essayist William Hazlitt, Wem is centrally-located within the seat and was the home of North Shropshire district council until that council's abolition in 2009.

The main road west from Whitchurch crosses straight over the border into the English Maelor, which is part of Wales, and comes out the other side of the Maelor into Ellesmere, which is part of England.  Here the landscape starts to become hilly, and Ellesmere is surrounded by a number of lakes which have been left behind by the most recent Ice Age.  Ellesmere stands on the Llangollen Canal, which was originally called the Ellesmere Canal and ran northwards to the Mersey estuary: the town which developed around the other end of the canal took the name of this small Shropshire town, and to this day it is called Ellesmere Port.

We continue west from Ellesmere, passing the ruined castle at Whittington, to the largest population centre in North Shropshire.  Oswestry is a border town which has changed hands between England and Wales many times, but it's on the English side of Offa's Dyke and has ended up as part of Shropshire.  Nevertheless this is one of the most Welsh parts of England.  Oswestry lies on the main road from Wrexham into Powys, and a number of its streets and nearby villages bear Welsh-language names.  The town is home to the Welsh Guards Museum and to The New Saints FC, the most successful team in the history of the Welsh Premier League.

The New Saints are the most successful team in the history of the Cymru Premier, the top football league in Wales.  They have won the league thirteen times, including eight seasons in a row from 2011-12 to 2018-19, and they are currently top of the Cymru Premier table.  The New Saints have brought European football to Oswestry every autumn since 2009, with the exception of 2013-14 Champions League qualifying when their home tie against Legia Warsaw was switched to Wrexham; however, they are yet to qualify for the group stage of any UEFA competition.  They went out in the third round of qualifying for this season's Europa Conference League, losing on penalties to Viktoria Plzeň.

The town's name in both English and Welsh (<em>Croesoswallt</em>) refers to a tree or cross associated with Oswald, a name often identified with King Oswald of Northumbria.  That Oswald died in 641 or 642 at the Battle of Maserfield, whose location is the subject of debate but is often placed here.

Oswestry differs from the other towns in North Shropshire in that it was a major railway centre.  This town was the headquarters of the Cambrian Railways, the major railway company in mid-Wales; the Cambrian's main lines ran from here to Wrexham, Whitchurch, Aberystwyth, Pwllheli and Brecon, with a few other branches.  Much of the Cambrian network survives today, but the Welshpool to Whitchurch section has gone.  That has left Oswestry with no mainline railway station today (the town's railhead is at Gobowen, some miles away on the Shrewsbury-Chester line), and the Cambrian Railways complex is now a museum.

The list of famous Oswestrians is a long one.  It includes the First World War poet Wilfred Owen, who was born here in 1893; and the composer Sir Walford Davies, who was born here in 1869 and sung as a boy in the choir of Christ Church, a Congregational church in Oswestry.  Davies became the first director of music for the Royal Air Force, composing its March Past, and succeeded Edward Elgar in 1934 as Master of the King's Music.  For an eaxmple of Walford Davies' work which is appropriate for the time of the year, here is his beautiful setting of the Christmas carol <em>O Little Town of Bethlehem</em>.

Another famous Oswestrian was the Welsh golfer Ian Woosnam, who learned to play the game at the Llanymynech golf club which straddles the English-Welsh border.  Woosnam grew up in the village of St Martin's north of Oswestry, which along with the nearby village of Weston Rhyn forms a very unusual corner of this seat.  St Martin's and Weston Rhyn were pit villages, lying at the southern end of the Denbighshire coalfield; Ifton Colliery, near St Martin's, was the largest coal mine in Shropshire until its eventual closure in 1968.

With the exception of Oswestry and the St Martin's area agriculture is the mainstay of North Shropshire's economy, but that doesn't just mean farming.  Market Drayton's largest employers are the Müller yoghurt plant and the Pork Farms factory, which makes sausages and other meat products for well-known retailers.  Whitchurch and Ellesmere both have a history of cheesemaking, and Whitchurch (thanks to its relatively good road links) is home to a large logistics firm which transports food from North Shropshire to your plate.

This reliance on agriculture has left its mark on the politics of the area, to the extent that the Conservative selection for North Shropshire has long been unofficially controlled by the local branch of the National Farmers' Union.  The NFU have certainly done well out of that, because this is - as we shall see - one of the longest-standing Conservative seats in the UK.

As usual in these Parliamentary Specials I'll start discussing the parliamentary history of this area in 1885, the year in which single-member constituencies became the norm in parliamentary elections.  Shropshire did badly out of the 1885 redistribution, going down from 10 MPs to just five: the borough of Shrewsbury and four county divisions, called Ludlow, Newport, Oswestry and Wellington.

The Newport (Shropshire) constituency of 1885-1918 covered the north-eastern corner of the county, including Whitchurch, Wem and Market Drayton as well as the eponymous town.  Appropriately enough, the first Conservative candidate for the seat was George Bridgeman, Viscount Newport, who had been one of the two MPs for North Shropshire from 1867 to 1885.  Newport, however, lost his seat to the Liberals' Robert Bickersteth by 4,694 votes to 4,333, a majority of 361.  Newport eventually returned to Parliament, but not in the Commons: he succeeded to his father's title of Earl of Bradford in 1898.  One of his granddaughters married into the Royal Family in 1935: Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester died in 2004 at the age of 102.

Robert Bickersteth was from an ecclesiastical family: his father, also called Robert Bickersteth, had served from 1857 to 1884 as Bishop of Ripon.  He had got into Liberal politics as a protégé of the Earl of Kimberley, who was Secretary of State for India going into the 1885 election.

The 1885 general election returned a hung parliament, with the Liberals being the largest party and the Irish Nationalists holding the balance of power.  This led to a split in the Liberals over the issue of Irish Home Rule, and Robert Bickersteth joined the breakaway Liberal Unionists.  The split precipitated another general election in 1886, which the Conservatives won; Bickersteth sought re-election in Leicester as a Liberal Unionist candidate, without success.

With Bickersteth off the scene in Shropshire the Newport seat became safely Conservative.  Its second MP was William Kenyon-Slaney, who holds an unusual sporting distinction.  Kenyon-Slaney has gone down in the record books as the first player ever to score a goal in an international football match.  He did so inside the first two minutes of the England v Scotland match at the Oval in March 1873.  To quote from a match report:
<blockquote>
  Scotland had the throw in, but threw the ball too far into the field, where Chenery got the ball and kicked straight for goal, and the goal keeper while stooping to lift the ball and kick it, slipped, and was at once charged by Slaney, who sent the ball under the tape.
</blockquote>
The tradition of embarrassing performances from the Scotland football team has clearly been going for longer than you might have thought.  Kenyon-Slaney went on to get a second goal as England ran out 4-2 winners.  Three weeks later he was on the Wanderers team which won the second FA Cup final, beating Oxford University 2-0.  (That wasn't the only loss for Oxford that day, as they went on to lose the Boat Race later that afternoon.)

As well as all this, William Kenyon-Slaney was a Grenadier Guards officer.  He fought in 1882 at the Battle of Tel el-Kebir, the decisive British victory in the Anglo-Egyptian war.  Four years later he was in Parliament, gaining Newport (Shropshire) from the Liberals with a large majority.  In 1887 he married Lady Mabel Bridgman, Viscount Bradford's sister.

Kenyon-Slaney was elected five times as MP for Newport, with nobody opposing him in 1895 or 1900.  His final re-election came in 1906, when he managed to withstand the Liberal landslide by just 176 votes; he polled 4,853 against 4,677 for the Liberal candidate Francis Neilson.

William Kenyon-Slaney died in 1908, aged 60, after suffering an attack of gout.  For the resulting Newport by-election of 14 May 1908 the Liberals again put up Francis Neilson.  Neilson went on to be elected in 1910 as MP for Hyde in what was then Cheshire, and the relevant <em>Times Guide to the House of Commons</em> described him as an author and journalist who had founded the <em>Democratic Monthly</em>.  That source fails to mention his work as a stage director which had already taken him to Broadway and Bayreuth.  Neilson had directed a 1900 production of <em>Tosca</em> at Covent Garden under the supervision of none other than Puccini himself, and he later turned down an invitation from Puccini to direct the La Scala opera in Milan.

Neilson's politics were on the Radical side, which were not going to help him win Newport.  The 1908 by-election resulted in a swing to the Conservative candidate Beville Stanier, a Shropshire county councillor who farmed an estate at Peplow Hall in the constituency.  Stanier was re-elected in both 1910 elections (without opposition in December), and he was made a baronet in 1917.

That was Newport (Shropshire).  To the west of this lay the Oswestry constituency, which covered much of the western half of Shropshire.  Oswestry started off as a safe Conservative seat, and its first MP was Stanley Leighton who had been the other MP for North Shropshire between 1876 and 1885.  Leighton was a barrister and antiquarian who owned a large brickworks at Sweeney, just outside Oswestry.  Earlier in 1885 he had been one of the organisers of the Wenlock Olympian Games, a forerunner of the modern Summer Olympics.

Stanley Leighton was elected five times as MP for Oswestry, with no-one opposing his re-election in 1886, 1892 or 1900.  He died in 1901, aged 63, having developed pneumonia after rushing through the rain to a Commons vote on the Coal Duty Bill.

The resulting first Oswestry by-election, held on 24 May 1901, was held for the Conservatives by George Ormsby-Gore who defeated the Liberal candidate Allan Bright by the large margin of 1,088 votes.  Bright, who had recently moved to Weston Rhyn after two unsuccessful Parliamentary campaigns in Exeter, blamed his defeat on "landlordism" and "shortness of time", and he might have had a point as far as the landlordism goes.  Ormsby-Gore was the heir to Lord Harlech, who had an estate at Brogyntyn near Selattyn, north-west of Oswestry.

In 1904 George Ormsby-Gore succeeded to his father's titles and entered the Lords as the third Lord Harlech.  The resulting second Oswestry by-election, held on 26 July 1904, came at a time when the Balfour Conservative government had become unpopular and with the question of tariff reform or free trade as a major political issue of the day.  The young Oldham MP Winston Churchill, a free-trader who had recently defected to the Liberals, turned up on the campaign trail in support of Bright, giving speeches in Ellesmere and Oswestry.  The Conservatives selected William Bridgeman, who was a cousin of the 4th Earl of Bradford and sat on the London School Board; he was a former cricketer who had played at first-class level for Cambridge University.  Bridgeman already had experience of politics at the highest level as a private secretary to the former Chancellor of the Exchequer Michael Hicks-Beach.  To general surprise, the Liberals' Allan Bright defeated Bridgeman by 4,542 votes to 4,157, a majority of 385.

Allan Bright was the last Liberal MP - indeed, the last non-Conservative MP - for this part of Shropshire.  A rematch against Bridgeman in the 1906 general election saw Bright fail to hold the by-election gain, and the Oswestry seat reverted to the Conservatives with a majority of 503.  The 1906 election nationally was a landslide for the Liberals, so this was an against-the-trend gain.  William Bridgeman was re-elected in both 1910 elections, increasing his majority to 624 and then to 746.

The 1918 redistribution cut the number of Shropshire constituencies from five to four.  The Newport constituency disappeared, with its area split between a new constituency of The Wrekin and a radically redrawn Oswestry constituency.  The new Oswestry seat, stretching across the north rather than the west of the county, had exactly the same boundaries as the North Shropshire constituency we have today.

It has proven to be a very safe Conservative constituency.  Since 1918 the Conservative majority in Oswestry or North Shropshire has fallen below 10 points on only two occasions.  The first of those was in 1923, when William Bridgeman was elected for a sixth term of office with a majority of 1,815 votes over the Liberals.  By this point Bridgeman was firmly on the Conservative frontbench, having joined Cabinet in 1920 as the first Secretary for Mines.  He was a supporter of the Conservative revolt against the Lloyd George coalition government in 1922, and was rewarded for that by being appointed as Home Secretary in the Bonar Law government.  Bridgeman was one of the more hardline Home Secretaries, and this may have contributed to his narrow majority in 1923 as the Conservatives lost their majority.

A year later Baldwin's Conservatives and Bridgeman were back in government after winning the 1924 election.  William Bridgeman served throughout that Parliament as First Lord of the Admiralty in what was his final frontbench position.  He retired at the 1929 general election after 23 years as MP for Oswestry, and shortly afterwards entered the Lords as the first Viscount Bridgeman.  From the Lords Bridgeman later served a year as President of the Marylebone Cricket Club, and he was briefly chairman of the BBC for a few months before his death in 1935.

Bridgeman passed his Commons seat on 1929 to Bertie Leighton, son of the former Oswestry MP Stanley Leighton.  Bertie had previously pursued a military career, serving both in the Boer War and in the First World War; he was severely wounded in the latter conflict.  Leighton thrashed the Labour candidate by 74-26 in the 1931 election, and nobody opposed his re-election in 1935.

Bertie Leighton retired at the 1945 election and passed the Oswestry constituency to Oliver Poole, who won without fuss against the Attlee landslide.  A member of Lloyd's of London, Poole had joined the family firm of City insurance brokers.  He was also a Warwickshire Yeomanry officer, and had served during the Second World War in a number of spheres; by the end of the war he was on the staff of the 21st Army Group, with the rank of colonel and a military CBE.

Poole served only one term in the Commons, being succeeded as MP for Oswestry in 1950 by David Ormsby-Gore.  The grandson of the previous Oswestry MP George Ormsby-Gore, and a great grandson of the former Prime Minister the Marquess of Salisbury, David was farming his father's land at the time of his election.

Ormsby-Gore slowly worked his way up the greasy pole, becoming a junior Foreign Office minister in the first Macmillan government in 1957.  He was distantly related to and a good friend of John F Kennedy, a connection which made him very useful to the British government after Kennedy's election as President of the United States.  In 1961 Macmillan appointed Ormsby-Gore as the British Ambassador to the US, an appointment which meant he would have to leave these shores.  He applied for the Chiltern Hundreds.

David Ormsby-Gore ended up spending four relatively successful years in Washington, becoming such a close confidant of the Kennedys that he proposed to JFK's widow Jacqueline Kennedy in 1967.  She turned him down.  By this point David had succeeded to his father's titles, becoming the fifth Lord Harlech.  He became a TV executive - the H in HTV, the former Welsh ITV franchise, stands for Harlech - and served as president of the British Board of Film Classification from 1965 until his death in a car crash in 1985.  A number of Kennedy family members turned up for his funeral at Llanfihangel-y-traethau, just north of Harlech on the Welsh coast.  His grandson Jasset Ormsby-Gore, the 7th Lord Harlech, won a hereditary peers' by-election in July this year, and at 35 years old he is the youngest member of the Upper House.

The third Oswestry by-election took place on 9 November 1961.  It was the first time that Oswestry had seen a parliamentary election with four candidates, although there wasn't much support for the Patriotic Front candidate who lost his deposit.  For the by-election Labour selected the former Oxford Union president Brian Walden, who was 29 at the time; Walden's career as a Labour MP and political interviewer lay in the future at this point.  He came a very close third behind the Liberal candidate John Buchanan.

The by-election was won easily by a Conservative whom Walden described, many years later, as the most honest politician he had interviewed.  John Biffen was 31 years old when he won Oswestry in 1961, but he was already on his second election campaign after contesting Coventry East (against Richard Crossman) in 1959.  He had previously worked for the engineering group Tube Investments.

Biffen went on to serve as MP for Oswestry, and for its successor North Shropshire, for over 35 years.  He was one of the few MPs to vote for Enoch Powell in the 1965 Conservative leadership election, and he remained on the backbenches under the leadership of Edward Heath.  His "dry" economic views were more to Margaret Thatcher's taste, and Biffen served in Cabinet throughout the first two Thatcher terms: as Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Trade Secretary, and then for five years as Leader of the Commons.

The 1983 election saw the boundaries of the Oswestry seat change for the first time since 1918.  The Wrekin constituency had become oversized as a result of the growth of the New Town of Telford, and to reduce its electorate the town of Newport was transferred to the Oswestry constituency.  The seat also got a new name: North Shropshire, reflecting the larger of the two new local government districts entirely within the seat.  The boundary change was reversed in 1997 when Telford got a constituency of its own, but the seat's name is still North Shropshire and hasn't reverted back to Oswestry.

Shropshire had already undergone a local government reform in the late 1960s, which reduced the number of councils within the Oswestry constituency from nine to three: Market Drayton, North Shropshire and Oswestry rural districts.  The big bang of 1974 merged the first two of these into a larger North Shropshire district, while Oswestry rural district was one of the handful of councils which survived the Heath reorganisation unchanged.

John Biffen retired at the 1997 election, in which his successor Owen Paterson was nearly swept away by the Blair landslide.  The Labour candidate Ian Lucas (who would later serve for eighteen years as MP for Wrexham) surged from second place to 36% of the vote, and Paterson's majority was only 2,195.

Paterson got stuck in after this rocky start, and he has made the constituency safe again.  He is a local, Whitchurch born and bred.  Before entering politics Paterson worked in the tanning industry: that's tanning as in leather, and at the time of his election to Parliament he was managing director of the British Leather Company.  North Shropshire was not his first election campaign: he had contested Wrexham in the 1992 general election.

After increasing his majority in 2001 Owen Paterson started to climb the greasy pole, joining the Conservative frontbench in 2003 as shadow agriculture minister.  In 2007 he became the party's Northern Ireland spokesman, and negotiated an electoral pact with the Ulster Unionist Party whereby the UUP and Conservatives would run joint candidates in Northern Ireland at the next Westminster general election.  The UUP were already well on the downward slide by this point, with just one MP left: Sylvia, Lady Hermon, in North Down.  Hermon subsequently walked out of the party in disgust at this deal and sought re-election to Parliament in 2010 as an independent candidate for her North Down constituency; she was resoundingly re-elected, and the Ulster Conservatives and Unionists won nothing.  The pact was not renewed.

However, things had gone well enough for the Conservatives in Great Britain that Owen Paterson was included in the first Coalition cabinet, as Northern Ireland secretary.  He was reshuffled to become environment secretary in 2013, a position in which he didn't prosper.  Paterson is a climate change sceptic and a supporter of genetically-modified food, and his tenure as environment secretary included an attempted badger cull which was widely seen to have been ineffective.  When interviewed by the BBC on the disappointing results of the cull, Paterson memorably stated that "the badgers have moved the goalposts".

Owen Paterson was dropped from Cabinet in 2014, and returned to the backbenches.  This represented rather a drop in his salary, and he started to take on paid consultancy work.  In 2015 he was taken on by Randox Laboratories, a clinical diagnostics company; and the following year he became a consultant to the meat processing company Lynn's Country Foods.  Taken together, his remuneration from Randox and Lynn's amounted to nearly three times his MP's salary.  This was properly declared in the Commons register of interests.

What was not properly declared was what Paterson did with that consultancy work.  In 2019 media reports were published which alleged that he had improperly lobbied for those two companies.  The Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, Kathryn Stone, opened an investigation in October 2019.

Stone's investigation was subject to a number of delays, partly due to the December 2019 general election, partly due to the COVID lockdown and partly due to the sad death of Owen Paterson's wife Rose in June 2020.  Rose Paterson, a sister of Viscount Ridley and the chairman of Aintree Racecourse, was found dead in woods near the family home in Ellesmere; the coroner recorded a verdict of suicide.

The eventual report by Commissioner Stone found that Paterson had breached the Commons rules promoting paid advocacy on fourteen occasions, involving approaches to the Food Standards Agency and the Department for International Development; he had failed to declare his interest as a consultant to Lynn's Country Foods in four emails to the Food Standards Agency; and he had abused parliamentary facilities by using his Commons office for business meetings and using Commons headed notepaper for two business letters.  With the exception of the headed notepaper use, Paterson denied the charges and went on the attack, making allegations against the integrity of the Commissioner and her team.

This did not impress the Commons Select Committee on Standards, which duly considered Stone's findings and concluded that
<blockquote>
"Mr Paterson's actions were an egregious case of paid advocacy, that he repeatedly used his privileged position to benefit two companies for whom he was a paid consultant, and that this has brought the House into disrepute."
</blockquote>
In their report, published in October 2021, the Standards Committee recommended a suspension of 30 sitting days, which would inevitably result in a recall petition being opened in North Shropshire against Paterson.

If Paterson's actions hadn't brought the House into disrepute (as he continues to maintain), what happened next certainly did.  The relevant motion to suspend Paterson duly came before the House on 3 November 2021 for its approval.  In an unexpected move, the motion was amended on the floor of the House to instead raise concerns about "potential defects in the standards system" and to refer the whole matter (including the Paterson case) to a new select committee for recommendations.  The government whipped its MPs to support this amendment, which passed the Commons by 250 votes to 232.

It quickly became clear that this was a major error.  The opposition parties announced that they would boycott the new select committee, and the government came under heavy criticism for its decision to effectively let Paterson off the hook.  A U-turn followed; the whole idea was abandoned, and it was announced the following day that the original motion to suspend Paterson for 30 days would instead go back before the House for ratification.  The press declared open season on other MPs with high-paying jobs outside parliament, and the stench of sleaze started to hang around Westminster again.  Owen Paterson concluded that his position was an MP was no longer tenable, and he applied for the Manor of Northstead, bringing a 24-year Parliamentary career to a sad end.

The resulting North Shropshire by-election takes place in a very safe Conservative seat.  Paterson was re-elected for his seventh and final term of office in December 2019 with a majority of 22,949 votes over Labour; he polled 63% of the vote to Labour's 22%, a swing of nearly 6% in his favour compared with June 2017.  As readers will have noted, Paterson was only the third MP to have represented this constituency since 1950, and the last time anywhere in this constituency returned a non-Conservative MP was the 1904 Oswestry by-election.

This large Conservative lead was mirrored in this May's elections to Shropshire council, which replaced the county council, North Shropshire council and Oswestry council in 2009.  The Shropshire divisions which make up this constituency gave 51% to the Conservatives in May, 21% to the Liberal Democrats and 10% to independent candidates; in councillor terms the Conservatives won 21 seats out of a possible 25, with two seats going to the Green Party (who are active in Oswestry town) and two to independent candidates.  The Lib Dems have no councillors in this seat, and indeed in May they lost the one seat they were defending (in Wem).  The only part of the constituency with a critical mass of Labour votes is the former coalfield villages of St Martin's and Weston Rhyn, but those villages have been placed in different divisions where they are outvoted by more right-wing territory.

So, despite the circumstances of the by-election, you'd think this should be a straightforward enough defence for the new Conservative candidate.  Neil Shastri-Hurst, who lives in Birmingham, certainly has an interesting life story from his 38 years: he originally trained as a surgeon, served in the Royal Army Medical Corps, and now works as a barrister.

Labour ran second here in 2019, and they have selected Ben Wood.  Aged 26, Wood is a political adviser to the party who was born and grew up in Oswestry; his first job was working in the tile department of an Oswestry hardware store.  He gives an address in the constituency.

The only other party to save their deposit here in 2019 were the Liberal Democrats, who finished third with 10% of the vote.  They have reselected their candidate from last time Helen Morgan, a chartered accountant who lives in the constituency.  At the time of writing, she was the bookies' favourite.

The Green Party candidate is Duncan Kerr, who has appeared in this column before.  Kerr first came to my attention in 2011 when he became the first and, so far, the only Green Party member of Bolsover council in Derbyshire.  He resigned from Bolsover council in 2013 and shortly afterwards turned up in Oswestry.  Kerr was the Green candidate for North Shropshire in 2015, coming within a handful of votes of saving his deposit, and he then contested the Oswestry South by-election to Shropshire council in February 2016 (<em>Andrew's Previews 2016</em>, page 24).  That by-election was vacated by the Shropshire council leader Keith Barrow after he became caught up in his own scandal over improper business interests; Kerr put the skills he had learnt in Bolsover to good use, and he won the Oswestry South by-election easily.  He lost his seat on Shropshire council in 2017, but got it back in May's election.

Keith Barrow may be out of politics now, but his wife Joyce is still a Shropshire councillor (representing St Oswald division, to the south of Oswestry), and his daughter Kirsty Walmsley is standing in this by-election.  She has the nomination of Reform UK.

The five candidates already named occupy the bottom five places on the ballot paper.  For a change I'll take the other nine candidates in reverse alphabetical order, so we start with independent candidate Yolande Kenward who has contested Maidstone and the Weald in the last two general elections.  The anti-lockdown Freedom Alliance group have nominated Earl Jesse, who gives an address in Berkshire.  Howling Laud Hope is back for his umpteenth election campaign as leader of the Official Monster Raving Loony Party.  The Heritage Party (a UKIP splinter group led by the former London Assembly member David Kurten) are represented by James Elliot from Preston.  If the criterion for winning this election was how far away you live from North Shropshire, then Russell Dean would win hands down; Dean, standing for "The Party Party", lives and works in Monaco where he is a consultant for a yacht broker.  Two London-based candidates appear next to each other on the ballot: Martin Daubney is deputy leader of the Reclaim Party led by the actor Laurence Fox; while Drew Galdron, who somehow manages to make money by being a Boris Johnson impersonator, has changed his name for this election to "Boris Been-Bunged" and has the nomination of the Rejoin EU group.  Whitchurch parish councillor Andrea Allan, who contested the Eddisbury seat in 2019, is the UKIP candidate, and at the top of the ballot is independent candidate Suzie Akers Smith, who is an independent member of Cheshire East council.
