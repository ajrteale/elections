CHILTERN QUIZ LEAGUE - JON JACOB

<img src="chesham-amersham.png" />

The county of Buckinghamshire is a surprisingly heterogeneous area, running a long way from the banks of the Thames in the south, through the Chiltern Hills, to the Aylesbury Vale.  Like much of the English county system, it is of Anglo-Saxon origin; but the ancient county town of Buckingham, tucked away at the northern end of the county it gave its name to, never grew into a significant town and is now rather a backwater.  Since its creation in the 1880s the Buckinghamshire council has been based in Aylesbury, while the county's largest urban centre isn't old enough to be drawing a pension yet: that's the New City of Milton Keynes.

Buckinghamshire has played its part in politics over the years.  John Hampden, one of the prime movers behind the English Civil War, was from a prominent Buckinghamshire family and was one of the two MPs for the county from 1640 until his death in 1643.  In those days Bucks enjoyed fourteen members of Parliament, two for the county and two each for the six boroughs of Wycombe, Wendover, Great Marlow, Buckingham, Aylesbury and a "thriving little market town" in the Chilterns called Amersham.

The Amersham parliamentary borough had a relatively democratic franchise, with all householders paying scot and lot having the right to vote.  However, in practice it was a pocket borough controlled by the wealthy Drake family of the nearby Shardloes stately home.  The last contested election for the borough was a by-election in February 1735, and from 1768 onwards all the town's MPs were Drakes (later Tyrwhitt-Drakes).  This was exactly the sort of abuse which the first Reform Act of 1832 intended to put a stop to, and Amersham was one of the many boroughs which were disenfranchised by the first Reform Act in 1832.

Following the passage of the third Reform Act in 1885, all of the parliamentary boroughs in Buckinghamshire were swept away and the county was reduced to just three MPs, elected from single-member constituencies.  The Buckingham constituency covered the vale at the northern end of the county; the Wycombe seat covered the western Chilterns and the southern end of Buckinghamshire, including a small place on the Great Western Main Line called Slough; while in the middle lay the Aylesbury constituency.  The Aylesbury seat of 1885-1945 was much larger than the seat of the same name which exists today, covering a large swathe of central Buckinghamshire and the eastern Chilterns, including the whole of the modern Chesham and Amersham constituency.

If the pre-reform Amersham constituency had been dominated by the wealthy Drakes, the Aylesbury constituency at this time was dominated by an even more wealthy and far more influential family.  The first election for the new Aylesbury constituency at the end of 1885 was won easily by the Liberal candidate, Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild.  "Ferdy" had entered the Commons just a few months earlier, contesting and winning a by-election for the old Aylesbury borough in July 1885 after his cousin Sir Nathan Rothschild MP was elevated to the peerage.  The first non-baptised Jew to enter the Lords, Nathan had been a partner in the London branch of the Rothschild banking empire, financing ventures including the Suez Canal and Cecil Rhodes' adventures in southern Africa as a well as a number of philanthropic schemes and good (or at least less dubious) works.

Ferdinand de Rothschild's country house, Waddesdon Manor to the west of Aylesbury, was nearing completion at the time and already filling up with the Baron's extensive art collection.  It also quickly became a place of political intrigue.  The Rothschilds left the Liberals over the Irish Home Rule controversy, joining the breakaway Liberal Unionists, and Ferdy hosted a number of prominent Conservative politicians in meetings which led to the Conservatives and Liberal Unionists forming an alliance.  Ferdy was re-elected in 1886 under his new Liberal Unionist colours with a massive 74-26 lead over the new Liberal candidate, and he was never seriously opposed in Aylesbury after that.  His last re-election as MP for Aylesbury, in 1895, came without a contest.

Ferdinand de Rothschild died in December 1898, on his 59th birthday.  The resulting Aylesbury by-election of January 1899 was won by the Liberal Unionist candidate Walter Rothschild, son and heir of the 1st Lord Rothschild, who was declared elected unopposed after the Liberals decided not to contest the by-election.  Aged 30 at the time, Walter had been put to work in the family banking business even though he had little aptitude for finance, and he was best known at this time as a zoologist.  Walter's zoological collection was opened to the public in 1892, and now forms the basis of the Natural History Musuem at Tring in Hertfordshire.

Walter Rothschild only faced one contested election in Aylesbury, holding out against the Liberal landslide of 1906 with a 56-44 majority (the Liberal candidate that year was Silas Hocking, a Methodist preacher and bestselling novelist).  Walter decided to retire from politics in 1910 and left the Commons, although as it turned out that retirement was short-lived.  He inherited his father's titles and entered the Lords in 1915 as the 2nd Lord Rothschild, was the recipient of the 1917 Balfour Declaration, and served from 1925 to 1926 as president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews.

Walter Rothschild was a prominent Zionist, but his successor as MP for Aylesbury was anything but.  Lionel de Rothschild, who took over the seat in January 1910, came to prominence in 1915 as vice-chairman of the Central Jewish Recruiting Committee, attempting to persuade Jews to enlist for military service; for this he was in the very first tranche of military OBEs when the Order of the British Empire was established in 1917.  In response to the Balfour Declaration Lionel was a co-founder of the League of British Jews, an anti-Zionist organisation which opposed the idea of a Jewish homeland in Palestine (although it was in favour of helping Jews who wanted to settle there).  Away from politics, Lionel de Rothschild was a noted gardener whose legacy today is the Exbury Gardens in Hampshire.

The Aylesbury seat experienced boundary changes in 1918, with the town of Beaconsfield being transferred in from the Wycombe constituency and Linslade, now part of Leighton Buzzard, moving into the Buckingham seat.  This didn't change things immediately, as Lionel de Rothschild was re-elected unopposed in 1918; but in 1922 he was run very close by the Liberals' Thomas Keens who lost by 13,406 votes to 12,835, a majority of 571.  Lionel chose to retire in 1923, breaking the Rothschild family's hold on the Aylesbury constituency.

The stage was set for two contests in Aylesbury between the new Unionist candidate Alan Burgoyne, who had lost his seat in Kensington North the previous year, and the reselected Liberal candidate Thomas Keens, an accountant who was active in local politics in his native Luton.  Keens served on Bedfordshire county council from 1901 to 1952, and went on to be knighted in 1934 for his public service.  Despite the intervention of a Labour candidate (Fred Watkins, who went on to serve two non-consecutive terms as MP for Hackney Central), Keens won the 1923 election by 13,575 votes to 13,504, a majority of 71.  He was, to date, the last Liberal MP for the area: Burgoyne won the rematch in 1924 very easily.

Alan Burgoyne retired in 1929 and was replaced as Unionist MP for Aylesbury by Michael Beaumont, a former Coldstream Guards officer who was the son and grandson of Liberal MPs.  He enjoyed a majority of 2,844 over Keens in 1929, and wasn't seriously challenged in 1931 or 1935.  In 1935 the second-placed Liberal candidate was Margaret Wintringham, who had won the 1921 Louth by-election as the party's first female MP.  Many years later, Michael's son Timothy Beaumont became the first Green Party member of the Houses of Parliament, joining the party three decades after entering the Lords as a life peer.

Michael Beaumont resigned as MP for Aylesbury in May 1938.  The resulting by-election later that month was held for the Conservatives by Stanley Reed, a journalist who had retired to the UK after a long career in India: he was editor of <em>The Times of India</em> from 1907 to 1924.  Reed enjoyed a large majority over the Liberal candidate Atholl Robertson, a fine arts publisher who had been MP for Finchley in 1923-24.

Stanley Reed was re-elected as MP for Aylesbury in 1945, with Labour moving into second place in the constituency for the first time.  Unusually, the Aylesbury seat was subject to a boundary change that year.  The town of Slough had seen huge growth in its population since 1918, resulting in the neighbouring Wycombe constituency becoming hugely oversized, and that was one of the seats which was split up in the emergency wartime redistribution of that year.  Most of Wycombe's electors went into a new seat with the establishment-friendly name of "Eton and Slough", while the rump Wycombe seat grabbed the Princes Risborough area from Aylesbury to make up the numbers.

Having been granted a fourth MP in the 1945 wartime review, Buckinghamshire got a fifth MP in 1950 with the division of Aylesbury into two new seats.  The northern end of the old constituency, including Chesham, stayed in the Aylesbury seat, while the Amersham and Beaconsfield end of the seat formed the major part of the new South Buckinghamshire constituency.  With Stanley Reed choosing to retire, both seats were open.

The revised Aylesbury seat proved to be rather more marginal than the old one.  For the 1950 election the Conservatives selected Spencer Summers, who came from a North Wales steelworking family and had been the MP for Northampton from 1940 until losing his seat in 1945; Summers had been a junior trade minister in the caretaker government going into that election.  The Labour candidate was Tony Harman, a farmer from Chesham who, many years later, became a <em>Guardian</em> columnist and wrote a bestselling memoir <em>Seventy Summers</em> which was televised by the BBC.  Summers beat Harman with a majority of 3,361, which increased at rematches in 1951 and 1955; after that he was only seriously threatened in 1966 when Labour got within 3,907 votes.  Away from politics, Spencer Summers had suffered tragedy in 1961 when his son Shane Summers, a promising young racing driver, was killed in a practice session at Brands Hatch at the age of 24.

Summers retired as MP for Aylesbury in 1970 after twenty years and passed the seat on without fuss to the new Conservative candidate Timothy Raison, a journalist who went on to represent the seat for 22 years.  Both Summers and Raison were, however, outdone in the length-of-service stakes by Sir Ronald Bell, who was elected as Conservative candidate for South Buckinghamshire in 1950 and was still an MP when he suffered a fatal heart attack in his Commons office in 1982.  As well as 32 years as MP for South Buckinghamshire (being the only MP to represent that seat) and then Beaconsfield, we can add four weeks as MP for Newport after Bell won the last of the 219 by-elections to the wartime 1935-45 parliament (<em>Andrew's Previews 2019</em>, page 77).  A barrister by career and prominent member of the Monday Club, Bell came to prominence in the 1970 Parliament as an implacable opponent of Edward Heath's leadership, to the point where Heath unsuccessfully tried to get Bell deselected in favour of Michael Heseltine whose Tavistock constituency was disappearing in the forthcoming boundary changes.

Those boundary changes granted a sixth MP to Buckinghamshire from the February 1974 election, and the new seat was given the name Chesham and Amersham.  Amersham and the Chalfonts came in from the old South Buckinghamshire seat (which was renamed as Beaconsfield), with the Chesham area and Great Missenden transferred from the Aylesbury constituency.  The new seat had exactly the same boundaries as the Chesham and Amersham seat of today, although there were different boundaries from 1983 to 2010.

Heath's attempt to deselect Ronald Bell came to nothing, and Michael Heseltine ended up with the Conservative nomination for the Henley seat.  Bell sought re-election in Beaconsfield and Timothy Raison stayed in Aylesbury, so the new Chesham and Amersham seat was open.  It proved to be a nice Parliamentary berth for the outgoing Defence Secretary Ian Gilmour, whose career to date had included service in the Grenadier Guards and the editorship of <em>The Spectator</em>.  Gilmour had been elected in a 1962 by-election for the Central Norfolk constituency, which disappeared in the 1974 boundary changes.  He was a junior minister for most of the Heath administration, being appointed as Secretary of State for Defence and joining Cabinet in January 1974.  Gilmour won with a majority of 10,416 over the Liberals.

Sir Ian Gilmour, as he became in 1977 after inheriting a baronetcy, went on to serve for 18 years as MP for Chesham and Amersham.  He returned to Cabinet in 1979 as Lord Privy Seal, but was very much on a different political wavelength to Margaret Thatcher and was on the backbenches from 1981 onwards.

Gilmour retired to the Lords in 1992, although he didn't end his career on the Conservative red benches: he was thrown out of the Tories in 1999 for supporting the Pro-Euro Conservative Party, of which more later.  He passed the Chesham and Amersham seat on to the first female MP for this corner of Buckinghamshire, Cheryl Gillan.  A former member of the LSO chorus, Gillan had spent her career to date in marketing although she had served in 1987-88 as chair of the Bow Group think-tank.  In the 1989 European Parliament elections she had contested the safe Labour constituency of Greater Manchester Central.

Cheryl Gillan saw off a number of future Labour MPs in her 29 years as MP for Chesham and Amersham: Candy Atherton (Falmouth and Camborne 1997-2005) stood here in 1992, Paul Farrelly (Newcastle-under-Lyme 2001-19) in 1997, Rupa Huq (Ealing Central and Acton 2015-) in 2005.  She got on the government ladder in 1995 as a junior education minister.  Gillan made Shadow Cabinet rank in 2005 as shadow Welsh secretary, and continued in that role for the first half of the Coalition government.

Gillan left the frontbenches in 2012 amid a huge local controversy in her constituency.  Chesham and Amersham lies on a straight line between London and Birmingham, and the High Speed 2 railway line was planned to run straight through the constituency from end to end.  This did not go down well among the voters of Chesham and Amersham, but High Speed 2 duly passed its Parliamentary stages.  Construction began last month on a 9.9-mile tunnel to take the new railway underneath this constituency.

This is not the only local controversy here.  In a constituency with a census district (in Little Chalfont) where the median property price in 2018 was £1.3 million, there is significant local opposition to moves to try and make housing affordable by the simple expedient of building more of it.  To make things more complicated, almost all of the constituency is within the London Green Belt.  Cheryl Gillan was working to get the Chilterns designed as a National Park, which would have provided a further brake on development.

Cheryl Gillan was appointed DBE, becoming a Dame, in 2018.  She died from cancer in April 2021 at the age of 68, prompting this third by-election of the 2019 Parliament.  In December 2019 she had been re-elected for an eighth term of office with a 55-26 lead over the Liberal Democrats, a majority of 16,223 votes.

From 2010 to 2020 this seat had the same boundaries as the Chiltern district of Buckinghamshire, whose last local elections in 2015 returned 35 Conservative councillors, 3 Lib Dems and 2 independents.  Chiltern district council was abolished in May 2020 in favour of a single Buckinghamshire council, which at its first elections last month returned a large Conservative majority.  Across the nine Buckinghamshire wards which cover this constituency, the Tories polled 43% of the vote last month against 25% for the Lib Dems and 16% for the Greens, with the Conservatives winning 26 councillors out of a possible 27; a Lib Dem seat in Chiltern Ridges ward (covering a number of villages to the north-west of Chesham plus part of Chesham town) was the one that got away.  In a parliamentary by-election, this sort of Conservative lead is not foolproof: the last by-election where the Conservatives held all but one council seat within the constituency took place in Richmond Park in 2016 (<em>Andrew's Previews 2016</em>, page 311).  They lost that one.

Chesham and Amersham may superficially share some similarities with Richmond Park (Remain-voting, lots of London commuters, sky-high property prices, that sort of thing) but this is an area which the Conservatives have represented continuously since 1924.  This was one of the two-dozen or so seats which were over 50% Conservative even against the Labour landslide of 1997.  Both of the previous MPs for the current seat have served in Conservative or Conservative-led cabinets.  There is a lot of Tory pedigree here.

Defending for the Conservatives is Peter Fleet, whose only previous parliamentary campaign was in that 1997 landslide where he contested Southampton Itchen.  Fleet has spent much of the intervening 24 years living and working in the Far East as a senior executive with Ford Motors; now back in the UK, he is the current chairman of the Retail Automotive Alliance.  If he is elected, with a height reported as 6 feet and 9 inches he would probably be the tallest MP of al time.

Fleet gives an address in this constituency as does the Liberal Democrat candidate Sarah Green, who runs a communications firm.  Again, this is not her first parliamentary contest: in 2010 she was the Lib Dem candidate for Arfon in North Wales.

Third here in December 2019 with 13% of the vote were Labour, who have selected Natasa Pantelic.  Pantelic is a Slough councillor, sitting on the council's cabinet with the social care and public health portfolios.

The only other party to stand here in 2019 were the Greens, who narrowly saved their deposit.  Their candidate is Carolyne Culver, a former Labour councillor in Hampshire who now leads the Green group on West Berkshire council; she is running on an explicitly anti-High Speed 2 ticket.  And there was me thinking the Greens were in favour of improving public transport on environmental grounds.

Four other candidates have come forward, and I shall take them in ballot paper order.  Brendan Donnelly has come to the notice of this column again: he was elected as a Conservative MEP for Sussex in 1994, unsuccessfully sought re-election in 1999 as co-leader of the Pro-Euro Conservative Party, and has since popped up at a number of elections under a wide variety of pro-EU labels with (to date) a total lack of success.  Last month Donnelly was fifth on the Rejoin EU list which came sixth with 1.9% of the vote in the London Assembly elections, and for this by-election he again has the nomination of Rejoin EU, whose political programme is left as an exercise for the reader.  Fighting its first election campaign is the Breakthrough Party, which describes itself as a "democratic socialist party, led by the younger generations set to inherit a world in crisis"; they have selected local resident Carla Gregory to try to make their breakthrough.  Finally we come to two candidates who appear to be going for the political space to the right of the Conservatives: Adrian Oliver is the candidate of the anti-lockdown Freedom Alliance, while Alex Wilson has the nomination of Reform UK.

<h2>Sewell</h2>

Norfolk county council; and

<h2>Sewell</h2>

Norwich council, Norfolk; both postponed from 6th May following the death of Conservative candidate Eve Collishaw at the age of 76.

https://youtu.be/lrCZUK2R7h0

The parliamentary by-election in Chesham and Amersham is not the only electoral action taking place today.  We also have seven local elections taking place today, four of which comprise unfinished business from the main local elections in May.  These are cases where a candidate died after close of nominations, and the election had to be postponed in consequence.

Two of these arise in Norwich following the death in April of Eve Collishaw, who was a Conservative candidate for both Norfolk county council and Norwich city council.  She had served on both councils before: Collishaw was a county councillor for 12 years (1997-2009) and a city councillor for 7 years (2004-11), serving in 2010-11 as the 100th Lord Mayor of Norwich.

Collishaw had continued to do her bit for the local Conservative cause by standing for election nearly every year.  This year she was contesting Sewell, a ward to the north of Norwich city centre.  Norwich has a tradition of naming some of its wards after local worthies: the Norwich School artist John Crome and the half-blind Norfolk admiral Viscount Nelson are commemorated in ward names here, as are the Sewell family who gave the city the open space of Sewell Park in 1908.  This is the family that gave us Anna Sewell, the author of the perennially popular novel <em>Black Beauty</em>; a horse trough has been placed in the park in Anna's memory.

norfolk-cc-sewell.png

The Sewell ward has a relatively young population, and makes the top 60 wards in England and Wales for people of no religion (45.3%).  The city ward was created in 2004, and the county division has had the same boundaries since 2005.  Norfolk county council was due to get new division boundaries this year, but the Local Government Boundary Commission's review was knocked off course by the pandemic and couldn't report in time.  The city ward was left unchanged by a separate boundary review which was implemented in 2019; accordingly, two years ago all three of the Norwich city councillors for Sewell ward were up for election.

On its current boundaries Sewell has voted Labour on every occasion except the 2009 county council elections, when the Green Party won here.  In the May 2017 Norfolk county elections Labour led the Conservatives here 60-17; the city council election here in May 2019 was a bit closer with the Labour slate enjoying a 53-28 lead over the Green Party.  Norwich city council has a Labour majority, while Norfolk county council is run by the Conservatives.  Sewell is part of the Norwich North constituency represented by the Conservative minister Chloe Smith, who has spent much of the last few months being treated for breast cancer: this column sends our best wishes for a full and swift return to health.

Both outgoing Labour councillors for Sewell are seeking re-election.  Defending the county council seat is Julie Brociek-Coulton, who has represented the area on the county council since 2013 and is seeking a third term in office.  The replacement Conservative candidate is Simon Jones, a financial consultant and chairman of the party's Norwich branch.  Also standing in the county by-election are Adrian Holmes for the Green Party and Helen Arundell for the Lib Dems.

For the city council the defending Labour candidate is Laura McCartney-Gray, who was elected in third place two years and accordingly was due for re-election this year; she is seeking a second term of office.  The Green Party have selected Gary Champion, a teacher who stood here two years ago.  Simon Jones is again the replacement Conservative candidate, and he and the Lib Dems' Helen Arundell complete the city by-election ballot paper.

<h2>Elham Valley</h2>

Kent county council; postponed from 6th May following the death of Chris Deane, who had been nominated as the Labour candidate.

kent-cc-elham-vy.png

We continue our unfinished business with a trip to the frontline of Brexit.  Part of the Folkestone terminal of the Channel Tunnel can be found within the Elham Valley county division; this is named after the village of Elham ("Eel-ham"), lying in the North Downs a few miles north of Folkestone and Hythe.  The river here is the Nailbourne, which flows north to meet the River Stour at Thanet.  Elham was the birthplace of the Kent and England wicketkeeper Les Ames, while other notable people associated with the village include the actresses Audrey Hepburn (who spent some of her schooldays here) and Pam Ferris.

Elham is just one of fourteen parishes which make up this division.  The largest of these is Hawkinge, a village just to the north of Folkestone which has greatly expanded in population in recent years.  Hawkinge was the location of the closest RAF airfield to France, and it saw much action during the Battle of Britain.  Some of the RAF Hawkinge site is now occupied by the Kent Battle of Britain Museum, but most of it has been given over to housing.

This division was last redrawn for the Kent county council elections in 2017, when it elected the Conservatives' Susan Carey with 54% against evenly-split opposition: 13% for UKIP, 12% for the Greens, 10% each for the Lib Dems and Labour.  In the May 2019 elections to Folkestone and Hythe district council the Tories won all five seats in the North Downs East and North Downs West wards which cover this division; Susan Carey was one of them, finishing top of the poll in North Downs West.

Susan Carey has represented Elham Valley on the county council since 2005, and she is seeking re-election for a fifth term of office as part of the majority Conservative group.  UKIP have not returned.  The Green Party, who have a significant group on Folkestone and Hythe council now, have selected Douglas Wade who is a district councillor for Hythe Rural ward, which is not in this division.  Labour have changed their candidate to Gordon Cowan, and independent Joe Egerton (who was on the ballot paper in May for a by-election to Canterbury council, polling 24 votes in Swalecliffe ward) completes the ballot paper.

Tandridge council, Surrey; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Ken Harwood, and postponed from 6th May following the death of Christopher Kelly, who had been nominated as the Labour candidate.

Our last piece of unfinished business from 6th May is rather unusual, in that this is a by-election to fill the longest-standing vacancy in British local government.  Ken Harwood, a Tandridge councillor for Felbridge ward who had served since winning a by-election in 2004, died from cancer in May 2020.  Because of the pandemic, the by-election could not be held before May 2021.  Tandridge is one of those districts which renews a third of its councillors at each election, but Felbridge ward is only large enough for one councillor and Harwood wasn't due for re-election until 2023, so this is a by-election rather than an ordinary election.  The by-election subsequently had to be postponed again to give Labour time to nominate a replacement for their original candidate, the late Christopher Kelly.

The village of Felbridge has essentially been swallowed up by the development of the neighbouring town of East Grinstead, but East Grinstead is over the county boundary in West Sussex.  Accordingly, Felbridge continues to get its services from Surrey county council and from Tandridge council, which is based in Oxted.  This is very much a middle-class area - in 2011 46% of Felbridge's population were in the ONS' professional and managerial occupational groups - but following May's elections Tandridge council is no longer run by the Conservatives.  They are still the largest group on 14 seats and are defending this by-election, but the council is controlled by a minority coalition of 10 independents and 8 councillors from the Oxted and Limpsfield Residents Group, who I hope will forgive me for summarising their policy position as "NIMBY and proud of it".  The remaining 9 seats on the council are held by the Lib Dems, who are strong in the North Downs commuter towns of Caterham and Warlingham.

Here at the other end of Tandridge district, Ken Harwood enjoyed very large majorities in his almost 16 years on the council.  In 2015 he polled 89% of the vote in a straight fight with Labour; at his last re-election in 2019 Harwood defeated an independent candidate by 65-23.

This by-election has a larger field.  The defending Conservatives have turned to the next generation by selecting Harry Baker-Smith.  Local resident Judy Moore, who has recently been made redundant after 34 years working for Mid Sussex council, is standing as an independent candidate as is Mark Taylor.  Completing the ballot paper are Richard Fowler of the Lib Dems and the replacement Labour candidate Emba Jones.
