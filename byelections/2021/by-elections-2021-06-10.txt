Two by-elections on 10th June 2021:

<h2>Grove Green; and<br/>
Lea Bridge</h2>

Waltham Forest council, London; caused respectively by the death of Chris Robbins and the resignation of Yemi Osho.  Both were Labour councillors.

Welcome to the first Andrew's Previews of the 2021-22 municipal year.  For those who haven't been here before, this is a theoretically-weekly blog which covers the most low-profile elections that take place in the UK: by-elections to our local councils.  Our remit is to travel up and down the country every week, shining a spotlight on parts of the country which you might know well or not at all, giving a sense of what the area is like and whether you might want to visit.  Or not, as the case may be.

At least, that's what's supposed to happen.  However, for pandemic-related reasons there have been no standalone English local by-elections since March 2020, when Gurdev Singh Hayre was elected as a Labour councillor for the Upper Stoke ward of Coventry.  All vacancies which were unfilled on that date, and everything after that date, had their polling days postponed to May 2021 or cancelled altogether.

The cutoff date for by-elections to be called for May 2021 was the end of March.  A number of vacancies have arisen since then, and there is also some unfinished business from 6th May which will be taken care of next week.  Your columnist has a list of (at the time of writing) 45 vacancies in our local government, of which 33 have polling dates set over the next two months.

There are further two by-elections to report which didn't get that far.  There was due to be a poll next week in the Caerphilly district of south Wales for the <b>Aber Valley</b> division; this is one of the smaller Valleys, with the division's population concentrated in the villages of Abertridwr and Senghenydd north-west of Caerphilly town.  These are pit villages, and Senghenydd was the scene of the UK's worst-ever mining disaster: an underground explosion at the Universal Colliery on 14 October 1913 killed 439 miners and a rescuer, a huge loss in a valley whose modern-day population is under 7,000.  Subsequent negligence charges led to fines of £24 for the colliery manager and £10 for the colliery company, which was calculated as equivalent to 1s 1¼d per life lost.  In more recent times Senghenydd is notable as one of the areas covered by the Caerphilly Heart Disease Study, which since 1979 has tracked the health of adult males in the area who were born in 1918-1938.  Aber Valley division has had a full slate of Plaid Cymru councillors since 2008, and Plaid enjoyed a 66-20 lead at the most recent Welsh local elections in May 2017; when nominations for the by-election closed Charlotte Bishop, of Plaid, was the only candidate and she has been declared elected unopposed.

We have also filled the first vacancy among the class of 2021, which arose offshore on the Isles of Scilly.  This arises from the retirement of Marion, Lady Berkeley, who had served for many years as a Scilly councillor for the island of <b>Bryher</b>.  A few years Marion married Anthony Gueterbock, the 18th Lord Berkeley; as this column has previously noted (<em>Andrew's Previews 2019</em>, page 44) Lord Berkeley is an active Labour member of the House of Lords, and even in these days of remote sittings it's rather difficult to do that from the Isles of Scilly.  Lord and Lady Berkeley now divide their time between Cornwall and London.  Lady Berkeley didn't seek re-election to the Council of the Isles of Scilly in May's election, and no candidates came forward to replace her so nominations for Bryher had to be reopened with a new election date set for 24th June.  Bryher is one of the smallest electoral units in the UK, with a population comfortably under 100, so a contested election was never likely; when nominations closed for the second time there was just one candidate, local fisherman Andrew Frazer, who was accordingly declared elected unopposed.  As with all Scilly councillors, he stood as a non-party candidate.  This column sends its congratulations to newly-elected Councillors Bishop and Frazer.

So, for our first standalone local by-elections in England for 15 months we have to go to that London and the borough of Waltham Forest.  In order to reach there we travel to one of the UK's newest railway stations.  Lea Bridge station, after being closed in 1985, reopened in May 2016 with regular trains south to Stratford and north up the Lea Valley.   The Lea Bridge itself was originally built in 1745 over the river Lea or Lee (the spelling, like the river, is a little bit fluid), and the Lea Bridge Road over it is the only road link between Hackney and Walthamstow.  Unusually for London, the Lea Bridge includes a significant amount of wild open space: the Leyton and Walthamstow Marshes, much of which are given over as nature reserves or for sport.

If you came to Grove Green ward expecting similar open space, then you'd be disappointed.  The name refers to a road running along the eastern end of the ward, which has been almost entirely built-up since before the First World War.  This is a residential area lying between Leyton to the west and Leytonstone to the east; Leyton Midland Road station, on the Gospel Oak-Barking line of the Overground, lies on the ward's northern boundary.

Like much of East London, the demographic profiles of these wards have been transformed by London's becoming a world city.  In the 2011 census, the most census for which these figures are available, Grove Green ward was in the top 20 wards in England and Wales for population born in the countries which joined the EU this century (16.2%) and within the top 75 in England and Wales for White Other population (24.2%).  Lea Bridge is even more of a melting-pot, being in the top 100 wards for those born in EU accession countries (10.6%) and for black population (24.0%), although Asian is in fact the largest ethnic group here (30.3%).  Both wards have significant Muslim populations, mostly of Pakistani heritage.

Both wards are also very safe for the Labour party these days.  Lea Bridge ward has returned a full slate of Labour councillors at every election this century; Grove Green ward split its three seats between Labour and the Lib Dems in 2002, but has been solidly Labour since 2006.  At the most recent Waltham Forest council elections in May 2018, Labour beat the Lib Dems 54-24 in Grove Green and enjoyed a 59-17 lead in Lea Bridge over the Green Party.  The 2018 elections returned a strong Labour majority in Waltham Forest, with 46 councillors against 14 Conservatives (all of whom represent wards in the Chingford area), and the safe Labour theme is continued at parliamentary level with both of these wards being (for the moment) in safe Labour parliamentary seats.  Lea Bridge is part of the Walthamstow constituency, Grove Green in Leyton and Wanstead.

In the London Mayor and Assembly elections just five weeks ago, Sadiq Khan beat Shaun Bailey 59-14 in Grove Green and 55-18 in Lea Bridge.  The Greens ran second here in the London Members ballot for the Assembly: Grove Green had 54% for Labour against 17% for the Greens and 10% for the Conservatives, while the shares of the vote for those three parties in Lea Bridge were 56%, 16% and 13% respectively.  As usual with GLA results quoted by this column, these figures are only for those voting on the day and do not include postal votes, which are tallied at borough level and traditionally skew to the right; however, the May 2021 elections saw a much higher uptake of postal votes than normal, and many boroughs reported unusually little difference between their postal and on-the-day returns.

So we shouldn't expect too much of a surprise in these two by-elections.  The Grove Green by-election is to replace the previous mayor of Waltham Forest, Labour councillor Chris Robbins, who died in April at the age of 76.  He had sat on the council since 2002, and became leader of the Labour group in 2009 and Leader of the Council in 2010.  Robbins served as council leader for seven years, being appointed CBE in 2017 for his public service, and was elected as mayor for 2019-20; his term was extended to two years on account of the pandemic.  Lea Bridge ward is also vacated by a former mayor of Waltham Forest: that's Yemi Osho, a long-serving nurse who was first elected to the council in 2014 and was the borough's first citizen in 2017-18.

Defending Lea Bridge for Labour is Jennifer Whilby, a black rights activist and local party officer.  The Green candidate for the ward is the unusually-capitalised RoseMary Warrington, who was their parliamentary candidate for Ilford South in December 2019.  Also standing are Sazimet Imre for the Conservatives, Naomi McCarthy for the Lib Dems and independent candidate Claire Weiss who has lived in the ward for more than forty years.

In Grove Green the defending Labour candidate is Uzma Rasool, a teacher, researcher and long-standing local resident.  The Liberal Democrats have reselected Arran Angus who was runner-up here in 2018; he is currently taking a career break to bring up his children.  Completing the Grove Green ballot paper are Mark Dawes for the Green Party, Shahamima Khan for the Conservatives and Kevin Parslow for the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition.

So, there you are.  Not the most exciting of Previews this week, but at least we are back to considering local by-elections in England after too long away.  And there should be some excitement with next week's Previews, which will include a Parliamentary Special.
