One by-election on 15th July 2021:

<h2>Tividale</h2>

Sandwell council, West Midlands; caused by the death of Labour councillor Sandra Hevican.

After the excitement of recent weeks this will be a short edition of Andrew's Previews with just one local by-election taking place today.  We have come to the heart of the industrial Black Country, the upper slopes of the Rowley Hills.  Rising to over 200 metres above sea level, the Rowley Hills divide Dudley from the Birmingham area and the Severn basin from the Trent catchment.  Their northern slopes look down towards lower ground in Oldbury, beyond the Wolverhampton Road and the Birmingham Canal.

The A4123 Wolverhampton Road, built in the 1920s as an unemployment relief project, forms the northern boundary of Tividale ward.  This is based on a number of housing estates of both private and council origin; the Tividale Hall and Grace Mary estates were started in the 1930s, but most of the houses here are postwar.  The 2011 census return is fairly unremarkable, although the White British population (82%) is rather low; there are significant black and Asian groups in the ward, the Asian community here being mostly Sikhs of Punjabi herigate.  In 2019 Tividale was assessed as one of the least-deprived wards of the Metropolitan Borough of Sandwell.

Sandwell council's elections had got very boring in the last few years.  Since the fall of the Labour government in May 2010 Labour had won every ward at every Sandwell election, with just two exceptions: in 2011 the Conservatives held Charlemont with Grove Wale ward, and Princes End ward returned a UKIP councillor in 2014.  UKIP also came close to winning Tividale that year, and Tividale has been fertile ground for the radical right in the past: the BNP, in the days when they were a significant electoral force, won here in the 2006 local elections by the narrow margin of 33 votes.  The BNP leader Nick Griffin himself had stood here in the 2000 Parliamentary by-election for the local seat of West Bromwich West, following the retirement of Speaker Boothroyd: he finished in fourth place and lost his deposit.

Since December 2019 West Bromwich West has been a Conservative parliamentary seat for the first time, in what must go down as a revolution in the politics of the Black Country.  The Conservatives now control two-and-a-half of the three-and-a-half parliamentary seats in Sandwell, those being the two West Bromwich seats and the Rowley Regis part of Halesowen and Rowley Regis.  They managed this despite the fact that Sandwell council had, at the time, 72 Labour councillors out of a possible 72.

The Conservatives followed up on this by carrying six wards in the May 2021 Sandwell council election, by far their best performance in the borough since 2008.  There was a very large number of casual vacancies filled in Sandwell in May, so this translated into 9 seats for the Conservatives; Labour continue to run the borough with 59 seats plus this vacancy, and the remaining three councillors are independents who were elected on the Labour ticket.  Tividale ward remained in the Labour column this May, but only narrowly so: the ward was a straight between Labour and the Conseravtives, with Labour winning by 53-47.

Tividale councillor Sandra Hevican died from COVID-19 in late March, at the age of 55.  Her death came just before the legal notices for the May elections were due to be published, and the by-election wasn't called in time to schedule this vacancy for May.  Hevican had served as a councillor for Tividale ward since 2014; away from her democratic duties, she worked for Wolverhampton council ss a housing benefits officer.

Defending for Labour is Sandra Hevican's widower, Robert Hevican.  The Conservatives have reselected their candidate from May Emma Henlan, an MP's office manager who also works in the family aquarium business.  There is a wider choice for the electors of Tividale in this by-election, as also standing are Nicholas Bradley for the Liberal Democrats, Richard Gingell for the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition, and independent candidate Energy Kutebura.

<h2>Catchup</h2>

Since it's a slow by-elections week, we've time to bring you some other election-related news.  One piece of good news is that the Cabinet Office minister responsible for elections, Chloe Smith, has successfully completed her treatment for breast cancer and been given the all-clear.  This column sends its congratulations.

Last week Miss Smith introduced into the Commons her major project for the new Parliamentary session, as the Elections Bill was given its first reading.  The headline provisions in the bill relating to photographic ID being required for voting have generated some controversy, but there's a lot of other things going on in the Bill, including: allowing British citizens living overseas to vote in UK elections regardless of how long they have been away from the country; new rules on EU citizens' eligibility to vote and stand in English and Northern Irish local elections (Scotland and Wales have already made their own rules on this); changes to the role of the Electoral Commission; and requirements for digital campaign material to carry imprints.  At the time of writing, a date for the second reading is yet to be set.  As usual, the Parliament website has the text of the Bill and some explanatory notes (<a href="https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3020/publications">link,</a>), if you want to find out more.

The Association of Electoral Administrators, whose members will have the job of actually delivering these changes for your benefit, have published their report on May's giant local elections (<a href="https://www.aea-elections.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/AEA-2021-Post-Polls-Review.pdf">link</a>) together with their <em>Blueprint for a Modern Electoral Landscape</em> (<a href="">link</a>), a list of process changes which they want making.  Top of their wishlist is a rationalisation and extension of the election timetable together with a new consolidation of election law.  As your columnist wrote last year in my piece on issues around postponing elections in a pandemic, the last consolidation (the Representation of the People Act 1983)
<blockquote>
"was passed into law at a much simpler time when there were only elections to Parliament, local councils and that newfangled thing called the European Parliament.  Since then we have had all sorts of constitutional innovations: devolution to Wales and London, the establishment of the Electoral Commission, mayors of districts and boroughs, regional and metro mayors, police and crime commissioners, newfangled electoral systems, extensions to the franchise, you name it.  All of that has to be bolted onto the 1983 Act which now has so many extensions that the structure is starting to sag under its own weight."
</blockquote>

Yes, I forgot the elections to Scottish Parliament and the Inner London Education Authority, although to be fair not many people remember the Inner London Education Authority over thirty years after it was abolished.  To give you a flavour of just how heavily the 1983 Act has been amended and how difficult it now is to follow, let's look at the sections of it relating to electoral registration.  My printed copy of the Act has four A4 pages of text under the heading "Registration of parliamentary and local government electors", divided into six sections numbered 8 to 13.  A Herculean effort from the team at <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1983/2/contents">legislation.gov.uk</a>, who really shouldn't have had to do this, has finally managed to bring the 1983 Act completely up to date with all the hundreds (possibly thousands) of amendments which have been made by scores of later Acts in the following thirty-eight years.  The table of contents now reads:
<blockquote>
<h3><em>Registration of parliamentary and local government electors</em></h3>

    8. Registration officers.<br/>
    9. Registers of electors..<br/>
    9A. Registration officers: duty to take necessary steps.<br/>
    9B. Anonymous registration.<br/>
    9C. Removal of anonymous entry.<br/>
    9D. Maintenance of registers: duty to conduct canvass in Great Britain.<br/>
    9E. Maintenance of registers: invitations to register in Great Britain.<br/>
    10. Maintenance of registers: duty to conduct canvass in Northern Ireland..<br/>
    10ZA. Northern Ireland: timing of canvass.<br/>
    10ZB. The relevant registration objectives (Northern Ireland).<br/>
    10ZC. Registration of electors in Great Britain.<br/>
    10ZD. Registration of electors in Great Britain: alterations.<br/>
    10ZE. Removal of electors in Great Britain from register.<br/>

    13AB. Alteration of registers: interim publication dates.<br/>
    13B. Alteration of registers: pending elections..<br/>
    13BA. Alteration of registers in Northern Ireland: pending elections.<br/>
    13BB. Election falling within canvass period.<br/>
    13BC. Alteration of registers: recall petition.<br/>
    13C. Electoral identity card: Northern Ireland.<br/>
    13CZA. Provision of false information: application for electoral identity card.<br/>
    13CA. Scottish local government elections: false information in connection with applications for absent voting.<br/>
    13D. Provision of false information
</blockquote>

I wish I was making this up.  That's 29 sections and God knows how many sides of A4.  I'm not trying to say all this isn't needed, but the thicket of suffix letters is a barrier to understanding not just for the average voter but for the election professionals in our local town halls.  The AEA point out in section 3 of their post-poll report that this fragmentation of our electoral law caused problems in drafting last year's emergency legislation to deal with the current public health situation.  So does the Elections Bill clean up this alphabet soup?  No.  In fact it <em>adds</em> two more sections relating to electoral registration (13BD and 13BE) among pages and pages of further amendments.

And this is just one example of how the state of the UK's electoral law got beyond a joke many years ago.  The AEA are completely right to call for a single Electoral Administration Act, and hopefully they won't be repeating that call for much longer.

One welcome change in the Elections Bill is a restating of the electoral offence of undue influence, which dates from 1883 and whose definition - written in very Victorian and increasingly archaic language - hasn't significantly changed since.  This change will hopefully help the Election Court in the future, although it won't be relevant to the three pending legal cases which this column is aware of following the May elections.

Of those three cases, the most straightforward would appear to be the one in the Banbury Ruscote division of Oxfordshire county council, which Labour are challenging on the basis that the result was declared for the Conseravtives incorrectly following an administrative error at the count.  In Coldhurst ward, Oldham, an independent candidate has lodged a case making various allegations about the conduct of the poll (<a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/beaten-independent-candidate-launches-legal-20844186">link to <em>Manchester Evening News</em> report</a>).  Finally, the Liberal Democrats have launched a case in the Totteridge and Bowerdean ward of High Wycombe (<a href="https://www.bucksfreepress.co.uk/news/19413177.high-court-urged-order-recount-election-votes-totteridge-bowerdean/">link to <em>Bucks Free Press</em> report</a>), where they lost in the Buckinghamshire county elections to an independent slate; that's a ward where a number of past elections have led to electoral fraud allegations, so this could be a fun one for the Election Court to sort out.  Andrew's Previews will of course keep an eye on what's going on, and once an update comes to my attention I will pass it on.
