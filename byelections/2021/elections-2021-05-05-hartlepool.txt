<h2>Cleveland</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

The Cleveland PCC since 2012 has been Labour's Barry Coppinger, a Labour man who had previously sat on Middlesbrough council.  Having already announced his retirement, Coppinger resigned as PCC in 2020 and his deputy has taken over for the rest of his term.  Coppinger was re-elected in 2016 with a 62-38 lead over the Conservatives in the runoff.

<h3>Tees Valley mayoralty</h3>

The Tees Valley mayoral election the following year told a completely different story.  The electorate here consists of the four Cleveland boroughs plus Darlington, and the addition of Darlington made all the difference.  Ben Houchen, who had previously been leader of the Conservative group on Stockton-on-Tees council, was elected as the first Mayor of the Tees Valley by the narrow margin of 51.1% to 48.9% over Labour in the runoff, having led 39.5-39.0 on first preferences.  With the Conservatives having gained three seats here in December 2019 (plus the Sedgefield constituency, part of which is in Darlington borough), and with local elections across the area since 2017 having been dire for Labour, Houchen must be fairly confident about the prospect of re-election.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

The only council in Cleveland holding ordinary local elections this year is Hartlepool, where local politics has been bizarre for many years and seems to have got more so since the Monkey Mayor left the scene.  All simian and indeed human life is here, and the council membership is the broadest of broad churches with members from the Socialist Labour Party at one end of the political spectrum, the For Britain Movement at the other end and representatives of nearly every viewpoint in between.  The Scargillite group is in fact the former Labour council leadership following a split in early 2019; that split and six seat losses for Labour in May 2019 means that the town is now in the hands of a group which was originally called the Independent Union, before affiliating to the Brexit Party, before leaving the Brexit Party and becoming the Independent Union again.  They are running the show in alliance with those obvious political bedfellows the Scargillites and the Conservatives.  Defections abound to the extent that this column has completely lost track of what is going in the Pool.  The usual medicine for political basket cases like Hartlepool is to hit the reset button with an all-out election, and as luck would have it the Local Government Boundary Commission were in town recently so there will be an all-out election this year on new ward boundaries.
