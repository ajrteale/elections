"All the right votes, but not necessarily in the right order"

Welcome to Andrew's Previews' lowdown on the May 2021 elections, which promise to be the biggest electoral event of this Parliament.  The whole of Great Britain is due to go to the polls.  And there's not just one type of election involved: many voters will have two, three or (in some cases) four or more ballot papers to juggle, and multiple electoral systems abound.  It's complicated.

Because of its extraordinary length this Preview will be split into four parts, set out as follows:
<ol>
<li>Introduction, Scotland, Wales and London.
<li>The North and Midlands.
<li>The South and East.
<li>The Parliamentary Special; and concluding remarks.
</ol>

Without further ado, here is Part IV: the Parliamentary Special.

<h2>Hartlepool</h2>

House of Commons; caused by the resignation of Labour MP Mike Hill.

<blockquote>
"The contest in Hartlepool will be very important, and no-one knows how it will turn out."

- <em>The Spectator</em>, 10 January 1891
</blockquote>

It all started on the headland.  The coast of Durham, like that of many counties on the east coast on England, is notably smooth; but a few miles north of the Tees estuary a small but solid peninsula juts out into the North Sea.  Since ancient times this peninsula has been an obvious stopping-point for coastal trade.  There's nothing to indicate that the Romans were ever here, but the Anglo-Saxons definitely were in residence; and the headland played its part in the survival of Christianity in these islands.

A lot of that survival is down to St Aidan, the Apostle of Northumbria.  Aidan was originally based at the monastery of Iona along with a young and pious lad called St Oswald.  Oswald was of royal stock, and in AD 634 he became king of Northumbria with a mission from God: a mission to bring Christianity back to his people.  He sent for Aidan, who based himself at Lindisfarne and set about his missionary task with gusto.

One of Aidan's works, in 640, was to help with setting up an abbey on the headland.  He installed as its first abbess St Hieu, an Irishwoman who is the first recorded woman to rule over a mixed religious settlement of both men and women.  Hieu's foundation became known as Hereteu - a name of unclear origin.  "Stag island" is the generally-accepted modern translation from the original Old English, although if you squint a bit it is possible to read Hieu's name into it.

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/Detail_from_St._Hilda_at_Hartlepool_by_James_Clark_%28Oil_Painting%29.jpg/1280px-Detail_from_St._Hilda_at_Hartlepool_by_James_Clark_%28Oil_Painting%29.jpg" />

St Hieu moved to Tadcaster nine years later and was replaced as abbess of Hereteu by one of the most important figures of the seventh century.  Seen here in a detail from a painting of her at Hartlepool by James Clark, St Hilda was by now in her mid-thirties; although she was of royal stock, she had become a nun and her star was rising under the influence of Aidan.  It was at Hereteu - modern Hartlepool - that Hilda first gained her reputation for wisdom and skilled administration.  Ihis was recognised in 655 by King Oswiu of Northumbria, who sent his one-year-old daughter Ælfflæd to be brought up as a nun under Hilda's guidance.

However, the placename that comes to mind for many people when St Hilda is remembered these days is not Hartlepool.  In or around 658 Hilda founded a new double monastery further down the North Sea coast at Streanæshalch, modern-day Whitby, and continued the Lord's work from there.  Hilda hosted the Synod of Whitby, convened in 664 by King Oswiu, which settled a dispute over the <em>computus</em> - the calculation of the date of Easter - by resolving that the Northumbrian church would celebrate Easter on the same day as the Roman Catholic church rather than follow the Celtic reckoning used at Iona.  Hilda died in 680, and Ælfflæd succeeded her as abbess of Whitby.

Following Hilda's departure nothing more is heard of the abbey at Hartlepool, and nothing remains of it today.  The abbey's cemetery has been excavated on the headland, and was the subject of an episode of Channel 4's <em>Time Team</em> broadcast in early 2000.  On that occasion one of their trenches obliterated the car park of the local Conservative club, which will have given some satisfaction to the series presenter Tony Robinson, a noted Labour Party supporter.

The modern-day church on the headland dedicated to St Hilda, which occupies roughly the same site as the old monastery, is a Norman building whose size and quality clearly shows that there was a fair amount of money in Old Hartlepool in the twelfth century.  It's not too fanciful to suggest that some of this will have been due to the patronage of the de Brus family, which controlled the town along with large estates in the north of England.  Robert I de Brus had come over from Normandy in the 1090s, and was made Lord of Hartness in 1153, but his family also ended up with a Scottish peerage as Lords of Annandale.  It was Robert I's son William de Brus, the 3rd Lord of Annandale, who persuaded King John to give Hartlepool a market charter in 1185.  The de Brus family, however, left the story in Hartlepool in 1306 when Robert VII de Brus was crowned king of Scotland; that prompted Edward I to confiscate his English landholdings and fortify the town.

The market, together with Old Hartlepool's fishing industry and its status as the major port of County Durham, ensured the town's survival through the centuries.  There was even a minor spa industry: the poet Thomas Gray turned up here in the eighteenth century for the waters.  To this day Hartlepool has its own water company, now a subsidiary of Anglian Water, which - unusually for the north of England - supplies hard water to the town's homes and buildings.

However, the headland was a constrained site with little room for expansion, and the Industrial Revolution threatened to leave Hartlepool behind.  By the early 1830s the town's population was only around 900, and its position as Durham's major port was under threat from new harbours at Seaham to the north, Port Clarence on the Tees estuary to the south, and a tiny but fast-growing settlement called Middlesbrough on the Yorkshire side of the river opposite Port Clarence.  Something needed to be done to ensure Hartlepool's survival in this brave new modern industrial world.

The borough council's answer was to establish the Hartlepool Dock and Railway Company, to build a railway connecting the town with the Durham collieries and to build new, large docks for modern ships.  The railway part of the plan worked pretty well.  The dock part of the plan was another matter.

Enter Ralph Ward Jackson.

Hartlepool council had engaged railway entrepreneur Christopher Tennant to set up the Hartlepool Dock and Railway Company.  Tennant died in 1839 and Ward Jackson, a solicitor from Stockton-on-Tees, took over the company's running with the dock part of the plan in some trouble.  The fault lay with the council, which had placed onerous restrictions on the redevelopment of the existing port and the surrounding area.

Rather than work within these constraints, Ward Jackson decided to go it alone.  He bought an area of sand-dunes just to the south-west of the headland, and built there a brand-new 8-acre dock, a brand-new railway to bring coal to the dock, and a brand-new town to serve the industries.  The business venture paid off, and in the end there was nothing Hartlepool council could do about it.

Thus was born the town of West Hartlepool, which grew from nothing in 1841 to a population of 28,000 in the 1881 census, more than twice the size of Old Hartlepool.  West Hartlepool was incorporated as a borough in 1887, and promoted to a county borough in 1902.

To the south of the two Hartlepools lay Seaton Carew, which was very different in character from the two industrial ports to the north.  This is a small but perfectly formed seaside resort, originally developed in the eighteenth century for wealthy Darlington Quaker families.  Seaton Carew's wide and sandy beach and art-deco bus station deserve to be better known, so it's a shame that the place has most recently come to public attention thanks to the 2002 canoeing accident in which local resident John Darwin faked his own death.  The sands at Seaton Carew hide the remains of <em>Doris</em>, a Danish schooner which was wrecked here in a storm in 1930.  Also washed up on the beach by every tide is a fine black powder: this is sea coal, from an open seam on the seabed.

Old and West Hartlepool, together with Seaton Carew, were enfranchised in the 1868 redistribution as the parliamentary borough of The Hartlepools.  Thus was born a constituency whose boundaries are little changed to this day.  Appropriately enough, its first MP was Ralph Ward Jackson who stood as the Conservative candidate and won - but only by 1,550 votes to 1,547, a majority of 3 over the Liberals' Thomas Richardson.

The following general election in 1874 was a rematch between Ward Jackson and Richardson, with Richardson winning handily to gain the seat for the Liberals.  He was a major employer in West Hartlepool through the firm of T Richardson and Sons, which made marine engines.  Unfortunately, shortly afterwards Richardson ran into financial trouble and was forced to leave the Commons.

The resulting first Hartlepools by-election, held in July 1875, was held for the Liberals by Lowthian Bell.  An alderman of Newcastle upon Tyne, Bell had been elected in the 1874 general election as one of the two MPs for North Durham, but that election was voided by the Election Court for intimidation by agents of the Liberal campaign, and Bell had lost the resulting by-election.  Lowthian Bell had also been elected in 1874 as a Fellow of the Royal Society and as the first recipient of the Bessemer Gold Medal; as well as being a metallurgist of some renown, he ran an enormous ironworks in Port Clarence with a number of associated quarries, was a director of the North Eastern Railway and had set up the UK's first aluminium smelter in Washington.

The 1880 general election in the Hartlepools featured two official Liberal candidates, with Thomas Richardson (his money problems now resolved) seeking to get his seek back and Bell looking for re-election.  This did not cost the Liberals the seat.  Richardson won with 1,965 votes, against 1,717 for Bell and 1,597 for the Conservative candidate, to return to the Commons after five years away.

The Liberal Party split in 1885 over the issue of Irish Home Rule, and Richardson was on the breakaway side of the split.  He was re-elected in 1886 under his new Liberal Unionist colours, with a 58-42 over the Liberal candidate.

Thomas Richardson died at the end of 1890, aged 69.  The resulting second Hartlepools by-election in January 1891 pitted together two men who both symbolised what West Hartlepool had become.  Defending the seat for the Liberal Unionists was Sir William Gray, who employed 2,000 men as a shipyard owner in this maritime town.  Gray's shipyard had launched 18 ships in 1878, a British record at the time, and went to claim the title of the UK's most productive shipyard six times in the years between then and 1900.  Gray had been knighted the previous year for his charitable work and service as Mayor of West Hartlepool.

In 1877 William Gray and Company had built a number of steamships for Thomas Furness and Company, a Hartlepool provision merchants firm which had decided to operate its own shipping fleet rather than rent space on other people's ships.  Thomas Furness and Company split up in 1882, with Thomas keeping the provision merchants side business and his younger brother Christopher Furness spinning off the shipping line under the name of Christopher Furness and Company.  Furness Line merged in 1891, the year of this by-election, with the Edward Withy shipyard in Hartlepool to form Furness Withy, which would grow into one of the UK's largest transport businesses and become the largest employer in the two Hartlepools.

With little to choose between Gray and Furness on background - they were both huge local employers with public profiles to match - many outside observers thought that the Irish Home Rule issue would decide the by-election.  Not so, as it turned out: Furness successfully wooed the town's working-class (or at least those of them who had the right to vote) by saying that he would employ only union labourers.  Furness won the 1891 Hartlepools by-election by 4,603 votes to 4,305, a majority of 298, and gained the seat for the Liberal Party.  The Liberal Unionists cried foul and threatened to launch legal action against the result, but eventually thought better of it.  As we shall see, this wasn't the only dodgy campaign associated with Christopher Furness, who holds the dubious distinction of being one of the few people to appear before the Election Court more than once.

The 1892 and 1895 elections in the Hartlepools were close contests between Furness for the Liberals and Thomas Richardson II, son of the former Hartlepools MP Thomas Richardson, for the Liberal Unionists.  Thomas II had taken over the marine engineers T Richardson and Sons following his father's death.  Furness won the 1892 contest by 4,626 votes to 4,550, a majority of 76; Richardson gained the seat in 1895 by 4,853 votes to 4,772, a majority of 81.

Sir Christopher Furness, as he was by now, then tried to get back into Parliament by contesting the York by-election of January 1898.  After losing by 11 votes to the Conservative candidate, Rear-Admiral Lord Charles Beresford, he launched proceedings in the Election Court to force a recount.  The recount resulted in a tie on 5,643 votes each with a number of dubious ballot papers reserved for the Court to adjudicate on; Furness was advised he wouldn't get enough of them to win, and the Court allowed him to withdraw the case.

The third Richardson v Furness contest in 1900 was a big win for Furness who recovered the Hartlepools seat he had lost five years earlier.  Having defeated Thomas Richardson II at the ballot box, Sir Christopher Furness then took over his company: a series of mergers transformed T Richardson and Sons into the marine engineers Richardsons Westgarth and Company, with Furness Withy holding a controlling stake.  This effectively neutralised the Liberal Unionist threat in the Hartlepools, and Furness was re-elected unopposed in the Liberal landslide of 1906.

Sir Christopher Furness finally over-reached himself in the January 1910 general election, at which he was opposed by W G Howard Gritten of the Conservatives.  Furness won by 6,531 votes to 5,754, a majority of 777, but then found himself back in the Election Court over campaign irregularities.  A wide variety of allegations were made against the Liberal campaign, particularly that it had gone over the election expense limit (Furness' election expense return was just a few shillings below the maximum), but the only such allegation that could be made to stick was that £5 of postage stamps had been omitted from the return, and the judges granted Furness relief for that.  However, it was proven that Christopher Furness' election agent had hired a band of miners to go around the streets intimidating voters, and the verdict of the Court was that Furness, by his agents, was guilty of the electoral offence of undue influence.  Accordingly he was unseated.  That was the end of his Commons career, although he found himself translated to the Lords in short order as the first Lord Furness.

The resulting third Hartlepools by-election in June 1910 had a very similar look to the January 1910 ballot paper, because the Liberals selected Stephen Furness, Sir Christopher's nephew.  Furness already had two winning election campaigns under his belt, having been elected to West Hartlepool borough council in 1897 and to Durham county council in 1898.  W G Howard Gritten returned as Conservative candidate.  Stephen Furness won the by-election by 6,159 votes to 5,993, a reduced Liberal majority of 166, and then won the Hartlepools' third parliamentary election in a year that December by 6,017 votes to 5,969, a majority of just 48 votes.

In 1912 Lord Furness died, and Stephen took over his uncle's business interests and became the new chairman of Furness Withy.  He was made a baronet the following year.  However, Sir Stephen didn't get to savour this power for very long: he died in 1914, having suffered an accident while on holiday, aged just 42.

The resulting fourth Hartlepools by-election in September 1914 took place during the wartime political truce, and was uncontested.  The winner was Sir Walter Runciman of the Liberals; the father of the long-serving Liberal MP of the same name, Walter senior had run away to sea at 11 and by 1914 he was a shipping magnate, having founded the South Shields Shipping Company (later the Moor Line) in 1889.

Shortly afterwards, the war came to Hartlepool.  The German Navy raided a number of east coast towns, including Hartlepool and West Hartlepool, between 8:10am and 8:50am on 16 December 1914.  1,150 shells were fired into the town; scores of civilians were killed as were seven soldiers.  Private Theophilus Jones, Durham Light Infantry, was the first British soldier to die from enemy action on British soil for two centuries.

Runciman didn't seek re-election once the First World War was over.  For the 1918 general election the coalition government endorsed the Liberal candidate Charles Macfarlane, but he was soundly beaten by the Conservative candidate W G Howard Gritten who had narrowly lost all three Hartlepools elections in 1910.  This election broke the mould in many ways.  It was the first Hartlepools election to feature a Labour candidate (locally-born trade unionist Will Sherwood, who polled 19% and saved his deposit), and it was the first Hartlepools election not to return a major player in the engineering or maritime industries.  The first Conservative (as opposed to Liberal Unionist MP) for the seat since Ralph Ward Jackson, Gritten was the vice-president of the Tariff Reform Federation and was best known as a barrister and writer.

The Liberals bounced back from their disappointing performance in 1918 to defeat Gritten in 1922 by 18,252 votes to 17,685, a majority of 567.  The new Liberal MP was William Jowitt.  A schoolfriend of Clement Attlee (in whose cabinet he served as Lord Chancellor, many years later), Jowitt was a barrister who had made it to KC on the day before polling.  He was re-elected in 1923 with a reduced majority, defeating Gritten again by 17,101 votes to 16,956, a majority of 145.

William Jowitt represented three different constituencies in the Commons (he was later elected for Preston and Ashton-under-Lyne), and he lost his seat in 1924 to another MP who represented three different constituencies.  After service in the Royal Engineers in the Great War, Bolton-born engineer Wilfrid Sugden had been elected as MP for Royton in Lancashire in 1918, but had lost that seat in 1923.  In 1924 he turned up as Conservative candidate for the Hartlepools, and defeated William Jowitt quite soundly.  Sugden didn't seek re-election here in 1929, instead choosing to return to Lancashire by contesting Rossendale (which he lost); he later served as MP for Leyton West in the 1931-35 Parliament.

Sugden's move to Lancashire cleared the way for W G Howard Gritten to return as Conservative MP for the Hartlepools in 1929, although he was pushed all the way by Stephen Furness junior, the son of the 1910-14 MP of the same name.  Gritten won by 17,271 votes to 17,133, a majority of 138, with Labour polling over 10,000 votes here for the first time.  Furness, as a supporter of the National Government, didn't contest the 1931 election and that didn't go unnoticed; he went on to be elected in 1935 as a Liberal National MP for Sunderland, without Conservative opposition, and served as a junior minister in the Chamberlain administration.

W G Howard Gritten wasn't seriously challenged in the Hartlepools constituency after 1929.  He was still in office when he died in 1943, aged 73.  The resulting fifth Hartlepools by-election in June 1943 again took place during the wartime political truce, but this time there was a contest.  The Tories' Thomas Greenwell, owner of a Sunderland shipyard, put the work in against independent Labour, independent Progressive and Common Wealth candidates and was rewarded with a 64% vote share - one of the best Conservative performances in any contested by-election during the Second World War.  The Hartlepools' first female parliamentary candidate, Elaine Burton of Common Wealth (who would later serve as a Labour MP for Coventry), finished second and saved her deposit.

The 1945 general election broke the mould again with the first Labour win in the two Hartlepools. D T Jones, a railway signalman from south Wales who had been selected as Labour candidate for the 1939-40 general election that never happened, rode the Attlee landslide to defeat Greenwell by the narrow margin of 16,502 votes to 16,227, a majority of 275.

Labour quickly consolidated their position, and the Hartlepools swung strongly to Labour in 1950 against the national trend.  That increased majority helped D T Jones to survive marginal results in 1951 (by 2,710 votes) and 1955 (by 1,585 votes).

It didn't help him in 1959 when the British film industry intervened.  Ten years earlier, during the Chinese Civil War, the frigate HMS <em>Amethyst</em> had been travelling up the Yangtse River to relieve another ship guarding the British Embassy at Nanking, when it was fired on by the People's Liberation Army with heavy casualties: 22 men aboard were killed, including the captain, and 31 men and the ship's cat were wounded.  Lt-Cdr John Kerans, the assistant British naval attaché at Nanking, took over command of <em>Amethyst</em> and, after three months of fruitless negotiations with the PLA, pulled off a daring night-time escape down the river to the open sea.  Kerans was subsequently awarded the Distinguished Service Order, while the ship's cat Simon became the only cat to date awarded the Dickin Medal for animal bravery.  Since this is the internet and there is nothing which cannot be improved by a cat picture, here is a photograph of Simon.

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Able_Seacat_Simon_%28fair_use%29.jpg" />

Kerans, now promoted to Commander, acted as a technical advisor for the 1957 war film <em>Yangtse Incident: The Story of HMS Amethyst</em>, in which he was played by Richard Todd and <em>Amethyst</em> was brought out of retirement to play herself.

Two years later John Kerans was in Parliament, having defeated D T Jones to become, to date, the last Conservative MP for the Hartlepools.  His margin of victory in the 1959 general election was 25,463 votes to 25,281, a majority of 182.  He clearly didn't harbour a grudge against the People's Liberation Army, speaking in Parliament in favour of Communist China being admitted to UN.

Kerans did not seek re-election in 1964, and the seat reverted to Labour whose successful candidate was Ted Leadbitter.  A teacher from Easington, Leadbitter went on to serve as a backbench MP for the constituency for 28 years.  While his judgment may occasionally have been suspect (accusing Commander Kerans, of all people, of cowardice for not seeking re-election was unwise), he was noted for his parliamentary work and for his efforts on behalf of the towns.  His parliamentary question in 1979 led to the revelation that Anthony Blunt, the Surveyor of the Queen's Pictures, was a Soviet spy.

It was during Leadbitter's tenure that the two Hartlepools became one.  Hartlepool borough and West Hartlepool county borough were merged into a single Hartlepool county borough in 1967, a move that did not go down well on the headland.  In February 1974 the constituency's name was changed to "Hartlepool" to reflect this.  Two months later Hartlepool town was transferred out of County Durham into the new county of Cleveland, a move that did not go down well among any Hartlepudlian.  This was followed in 1983 by the only change of any significance to the parliamentary boundaries since 1867, with the transfer in of eight small rural parishes which were previously in the Easington constituency.  This boosted the constituency's electorate by only about 3%, so describing the Hartlepool constituency as "semi-rural" is not accurate.  (The present Rural West ward, as I shall discuss later, is misleadingly named.)  The seat has had unchanged boundaries since 1983 and, having the same boundaries as Hartlepool council, is likely to escape the next boundary review unscathed.

The town has changed over the postwar years as well.  The shipyards closed down in the 1960s, and the associated industries went into decline.  There's still a lot of industry here: the nuclear power station is one of the town's largest employers, and the Liberty Steel factory makes pipes for the energy and construction industries, but the industries don't employ anything like the number of people they used to in the old days, the power station is coming to the end of its useful life and the steel mill is threatened by the recent collapse of Greensill Capital, its major lender.  Unemployment has been a major and chronic problem here for decades, and this has led to an increase in the town's average age as young people leave to find work elsewhere.

Ted Leadbitter was run fairly close at his first election by the Tories' Geoffrey Dodsworth (later an MP for Hertfordshire in the 1970s), winning with a margin of 2,867.  After that he made the seat safe, only being seriously challenged in February 1974 and 1983.

Leadbitter retired in 1992 and passed the seat on to one of the most influential figures in the Labour Party over the last 40 years.  A grandson of the former London County Council leader and Attlee cabinet member Herbert Morrison, Peter Mandelson first came to prominence in 1985 when he was appointed as director of communications for the Labour party.  He was elected as MP for Hartlepool in 1992, served as director of the Labour campaign for the 1997 general election with some success, and served in Cabinet in 1998 as trade and industry secretary and as Northern Ireland secretary from 1999 to 2001.  Mandelson has long had a reputation as a master of the dark political arts - the character of Malcolm Tucker in <em>The Thick of It</em> was partially based on him - so it's ironic that both of those spells in Cabinet were terminated by scandal-induced resignations.

It was during Mandelson's time in office that the county of Cleveland was dissolved and Hartlepool became a unitary council.  It was also during Mandelson's time in office that Hartlepool council started to turn in weird election results.  The fun begin in 2000 when the Liberal Democrats suddenly won seven out of 15 wards, a figure they have never matched before or since, and Labour lost overall control of the council.  This wasn't caused by freak vote splits - six wards in that election were straight fights between Labour and the Lib Dems and, ironically in view of what was to come, there wasn't a single independent or minor-party candidate to be seen.

A referendum in October 2001 then produced a very close vote in favour of introducing an elected mayor (10,667 in favour, 10,294 against).  The first mayoral election, held in May 2002, turned in an infamous result.  The first round was very close between Labour, on 28%, and two independent candidates: Ian Cameron on 27% and Stuart Drummond on 29%.  Drummond, a 28-year-old who had previously worked as the mascot for Hartlepool United football club and was standing as a publicity stunt for the club, went on to win the runoff against Labour by a 52-48 margin.

Peter Mandelson resigned in 2004 to become the UK representative on the European Commission.  The resulting sixth Hartlepool by-election, held in September 2004, returned Labour's Iain Wright by a relatively narrow margin over the Lib Dems.  At the time of his election Wright was a Hartlepool councillor (representing Rift House ward) and working as a chartered accountant.













<h2>Introduction</h2>

Parts II and III of this preview divide England (outside London) up into its police areas.  Each section starts with a discussion of the Police and Crime Commissioner and (if any) the combined authority mayoral election, followed by the local councils within the police area.

These previews will make a lot of comparisons with 2019, for the purpose of establishing something of a "par score".  The May 2019 local elections took place in a political scene much more like May 2016 than May 2017 and, unusually, happened at a time when <em>both</em> major parties were in a weak position but while the new forces taking votes off them, the Brexit Party and Change UK, were not ready for prime time.  While there was a lot of anti-incumbent sentiment about, those new parties were unable to take advantage as they had no candidates; so that anti-incumbent sentiment manifested itself in many areas with large shares for independent candidates and localist parties.  These small groups had been mostly swamped in 2015 by general election turnout, so 2019 marked something of a renaissance for them.

Since March 2020, local by-elections in England have been suspended due to reasons which are obvious.  Some local by-elections have taken place in Wales, and the Scottish returning officers have efficiently cleared their vacancy backlog, but in England we have no information from real-life elections as to how things are going.  We only have the national opinion polls, which suggest a national picture closer to May 2017 (when the Conservatives were well ahead in the opinion polls and in the local elections) than to May 2016 (when the two main parties were neck-and-neck).  How this will translate into a series of local pictures is extremely difficult to predict, but one reasonable guess might be that the Conservatives consistently do better than the 2019 "par scores" set out in this preview.

Because of the limited space and time available and the extraordinary number of by-elections, I have applied a much stronger than usual filter when naming candidates in the 6th May previews.  All mayoral and PCC candidates have been namechecked, but by-election candidates are generally only named in this text if their party was within 10% last time out.  For a full list of by-election candidates I will refer you to <a href="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/2021-byelections.pdf">this file (link)</a>.  If you're a by-election candidate and you're not happy with not having your name in this preview, then I would love you to prove me wrong by going ahead and winning your contest.  In most cases you can click on each by-election's name to see previous results from the Local Elections Archive Project.  As usual, the maps are the results from the last time the seats up for election were contested, in most cases 2016 or 2017 - one electoral cycle ago.

Despite my best efforts, I am fully aware that there will be mistakes in this preview.  Have fun finding them.

So now, here is Part III, covering the south of England outside London (for which, see Part I).  We will start in the South West, and then flip over to East Anglia and the Home Counties.


<h2>Cleveland</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

The Cleveland PCC since 2012 has been Labour's Barry Coppinger, a Labour man who had previously sat on Middlesbrough council.  Having already announced his retirement, Coppinger resigned as PCC in 2020 and his deputy has taken over for the rest of his term.  Coppinger was re-elected in 2016 with a 62-38 lead over the Conservatives in the runoff.

<h3>Tees Valley mayoralty</h3>

The Tees Valley mayoral election the following year told a completely different story.  The electorate here consists of the four Cleveland boroughs plus Darlington, and the addition of Darlington made all the difference.  Ben Houchen, who had previously been leader of the Conservative group on Stockton-on-Tees council, was elected as the first Mayor of the Tees Valley by the narrow margin of 51.1% to 48.9% over Labour in the runoff, having led 39.5-39.0 on first preferences.  With the Conservatives having gained three seats here in December 2019 (plus the Sedgefield constituency, part of which is in Darlington borough), and with local elections across the area since 2017 having been dire for Labour, Houchen must be fairly confident about the prospect of re-election.

The only council in Cleveland holding ordinary local elections this year is Hartlepool, where local politics has been bizarre for many years and seems to have got more so since the Monkey Mayor left the scene.  All simian and indeed human life is here, and the council membership is the broadest of broad churches with members from the Socialist Labour Party at one end of the political spectrum, the For Britain Movement at the other end and representatives of nearly every viewpoint in between.  The Scargillite group is in fact the former Labour council leadership following a split in early 2019; that split and six seat losses for Labour in May 2019 means that the town is now in the hands of a group which was originally called the Independent Union, before affiliating to the Brexit Party, before leaving the Brexit Party and becoming the Independent Union again.  They are running the show in alliance with those obvious political bedfellows the Scargillites and the Conservatives.  Defections abound to the extent that this column has completely lost track of what is going in the Pool.  The usual medicine for political basket cases like Hartlepool is to hit the reset button with an all-out election, and as luck would have it the Local Government Boundary Commission were in town recently so there will be an all-out election this year on new ward boundaries.
