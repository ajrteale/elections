It's Super Thursday today, with thirteen by-elections taking place today in the biggest test of public opinion remaining this year.  Let's start with the big one:

<h2>North Yorkshire Police and Crime Commissioner; and<br/>
Raskelf and White Horse</h2>

The by-election for North Yorkshire PCC follows the resignation of Conservative PCC Philip Allott.  The by-election for Raskelf and White Horse ward, Hambleton council, follows the resignation of Conservative councillor Jill Mortimer who is now the MP for Hartlepool.

Your columnist has a regular habit of doing a lot of Christmas shopping in the tiny city of Ripon.  "Stay awhile amid its ancient charms", say the signs leading into the city, and Ripon is certainly a charming place which the Industrial Revolution essentially passed by.  The market square was described by Daniel Defoe as "the finest and most beautiful square that is to be seen of its kind in England", and a few centuries on from Defoe's time that's still a fair assessment.  Every evening at 9pm a hornblower turns up in the market square, providing a timecheck for the locals.  The city's impressive cathedral dates from the twelfth century, and includes a tiny crypt from a previous Anglo-Saxon monastery constructed by the seventh-century St Wilfrid.

Just to the west of Ripon is the only UNESCO World Heritage Site in North Yorkshire.  Studley Royal Park is a romantic landscape garden dating to the eighteenth century.  You're probably a bit too late in the autumn now to get the full effect of the tree colours, but the Studley Royal Park also contains the extensive ruins of Fountains Abbey.  Fountains controlled extensive lands in the Yorkshire Dales back in the day, making it one of the largest and richest monasteries in England up until the time of dissolution.

The preservation of Fountains' ruins owes a lot to the taste of John Aislabie, who was MP for Ripon for much of the early 18th century and owned the Studley Royal estate.  Aislabie had been mayor of Ripon in 1702-03, and erected the obelisk in the market square which still stands.  He was appointed as Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1718, and in that capacity he negotiated a notorious deal whereby the UK national debt was taken over by the South Sea Company in return for government bonds.  The South Sea Company subsequently collapsed in 1720 with massive losses for much of the UK's upper classes.  Parliament set up an inquiry, which reported that the government's support for the scheme was a result of massive levels of corruption.  Aislabie himself had received £20,000 in South Sea stock.  He was expelled from the House of Commons and the Privy Council, which left him free to concentrate on the development of the Studley Royal garden once he was eventually released from the Tower of London.

The Industrial Revolution may have passed Ripon by, but it has had an effect on other locations in North Yorkshire.  Most notably, Skipton, which is a classic Pennine textile town and also, these days, a commuter centre for the cities of west Yorkshire.

Skipton is also a major tourist draw, thanks to its proximity to the countryside of the Yorkshire Dales National Park.  Within striking distance of Skipton can be found the village of Malham, where generations of Yorkshire schoolchildren have been sent to learn geology; while for hikers there is the attraction of the Three Peaks of Whernside, Ingleborough and Penyghent.  The countryside around Skipton and the Dales was brought to a wider audience in 2014, when the first two stages of the Tour de France were routed through Yorkshire.

The Dales give way in the east to the Vale of York, a low-lying area in the north of the county through which the main communication links to north-east England pass.  Major towns here include Northallerton (the home of North Yorkshire county council), Thirsk and Richmond, together with the enormous Army garrison at Catterick.  The military have an extensive presence in North Yorkshire.  As well as Catterick, there are a number of RAF airbases in the Vale of York and two large intelligence stations: the "golf balls" at Menwith Hill which the US authorities use for surveillance, and the radar station on the coast at RAF Fylingdales watching for incoming missiles.

The Fylingdales radar station lies in North Yorkshire's second national park, the North York Moors.  This rugged (although not particularly high) moorland extends over a wide area in the north-east of the county, and takes in the port of Whitby.  This town is a tourist trap for all sorts of reasons - Captain Cook, Dracula, goth culture, superlative fish and chips - but it should also be well known for an event which took place here in 664.  The Synod of Whitby, hosted here in 664 by St Hilda, led to a decision by King Oswiu that the kingdom of Northumbria should come into line with the Roman Catholic church in customs including the calculation of Easter.  St Wilfred, builder of the tiny crypt under Ripon Cathedral, led the argument in favour of the Roman practice at the Synod.

Whitby is not the major town on the Yorkshire coast.  This is the resort town of Scarborough, located either side of a promontory in the North Sea.  Scarborough has a long history and a fishing industry, but it was made what it is today by the Victorians.  The Grand Hotel in Scarborough, at the time of its opening in 1867, was the largest hotel in Europe; unfortunately it has fallen into the hands of the Britannia group.

The Victorians also made the largest and most expensive population centre covered by North Yorkshire county council.  This is Harrogate, a spa town which has given us Yorkshire Tea (which, according to the Speaker of the House of Commons, is one of only two good things to come out of Yorkshire), Betty's tearooms, a thriving conference industry and the 1982 Eurovision Song Contest.  The Liberal Democrats have held a number of party conferences in Harrogate over the years.

The south of the county has an economy dominated by energy.  Kellingley Colliery, closed in December 2015, was the last deep coal mine in the UK.  It was part of the Selby coalfield which provided the basis for three large coal-fired power stations at the southern end of North Yorkshire.  The cooling towers at Eggborough power station were demolished last month, but some of Ferrybridge's towers are still standing for reuse in a future gas-fired plant.  And then there is Drax.  Now fully converted to biomass operation, Drax is the largest power station in the UK and provides 6% of the country's electricity.

In the centre of all this is an ancient city which was known as <em>Eboracom</em> to the Romans, <em>Eoforwic<em> to the Anglo-Saxons and <em>Jorvik</em> to the Vikings.  York, as centuries of smoothing have turned <em>Jorvik</em> into, was for centuries the major urban centre in the north of England.  The Industrial Revolution has put paid to that status, but York is still by far the largest city in North Yorkshire.  Major employers here have traditionally included the Rowntree chocolate factory and the railways.  The National Railway Museum, one of the UK's largest and most-visited museums, has been located here since 1975.  The University of York was founded in 1963, on a duck-infested campus at Heslington to the south-east of the city; it has educated a number of our most prominent politicians, including the Mother of the House Harriet Harman.

York may be the largest city in North Yorkshire but only about a quarter of the county's population lives there (and this includes a significant rural hinterland which lies within the city boundary).  Much of the acreage of North Yorkshire is agricultural, with prime farming land in the Vale of York complemented by upland sheep farming in the Dales.  Those of a certain age might remember the books of the Yorkshire vet James Herriot, turned into the successful TV series <em>All Creatures Great and Small</em>; Herriot was the pseudonym of Alfred Wight, who worked as a vet in Thirsk for fifty years.

It's this rural area, and the Conservatism which dominates it, that sets the tone for North Yorkshire's elections.  This is the most Conservative part of Yorkshire: even in the disaster year of 1997, the Tories still held four of the county's eight parliamentary constituencies (three went to Labour and one to the Lib Dems).  The Richmond constituency, which has voted Conservative at every election since 1886 with the exception of the 1906 Liberal landslide, has since 1983 been represented by three titans of modern Conservatism: the European Commissioner Leon Brittan, the party leader William Hague, and the current Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak.

Since 2010 North Yorkshire has represented by 7 Conservative MPs against 1 Labour (from the York Central constituency).  The December 2019 general election gave the Conservatives 54% of the vote across the county, with Labour coming in second on 26%.

Local elections, as we can see from the map above (in which each ward has been resized in proportion to its population), are a more mixed picture.  The Conservatives control the district councils in Harrogate (which includes Ripon and a large rural area), Hambleton (covering the Vale of York) and Selby, and also have half of the seats in Craven district (based on Skipton and Settle) which they run in coalition with independents.  The other four districts covering the county have anti-Conservative coalitions: York is run by the Lib Dems and Greens and is the weakest Conservative area of the county, Scarborough is run by Labour and independent councillors, Ryedale (based on the agricultural Vale of Pickering) is run by Lib Dem and independent councillors, and Richmondshire council has an independent-led coalition with the Lib Dems and Greens.

Not for much longer though, probably.  Local government reorganisation is in the works, and the likelihood is that all of these councils (except for York, which has unitary status) will probably be swept away in a takeover by North Yorkshire county council, which has a Conservative majority.  Mind, anybody who thinks that Bentham is local to Scarborough or Selby, despite their being in the same county, probably hasn't grasped the concept of <em>local</em> in local government.  All of those locations are over an hour (in some cases, well over an hour) by road from Northallerton, where the new North Yorkshire council will probably be administered from.

The three elections to date for North Yorkshire Police and Crime Commissioner have resulted in Conservative wins, although they have all gone to runoffs.  The Conservative majority over Labour has steadily increased, from 58-42 at the comedy elections of November 2012 to 61-39 at the last PCC elections in May this year.  The Tories weren't far off winning six months ago on first preferences alone: the first count gave 47% to the Conservatives, 26% to Labour and 14% to independent candidate Keith Tordoff.

That was the first major election win for Philip Allott, a former leader of the Conservative group on Harrogate council who had been elected as Mayor of Knaresborough when he was just 25 years old.  Allott had previously stood for parliament four times, losing three times in marginal seats: in Bolton West in 2005, and in Halifax in 2010 and 2015; on the last occasion, he finished 428 votes behind the new Labour candidate.  He finally got his chance at high office after the previous Conservative PCC Julia Mulligan, who had served since 2012, was deselected.

Philip Allott served for just five months as North Yorkshire Police and Crime Commissioner.  His downfall came as the result of an interview he made to BBC Radio York following the sentencing of a police officer for the murder of Sarah Everard in London.  Allott's remarks that women should be "streetwise" caused sustained outrage, and he resigned as commissioner two weeks later after losing the confidence of the North Yorkshire Police, Fire and Crime Panel.

This kicks into force the police and crime commissioner by-election rules, which have been criticised in this column on a number of previous occasions.  Suffice to say that the timing of Allott's resignation meant that the by-election would have to take place either this week or next week.  It's a ridiculously short time to organise a by-election across such a large area for such an important post.

Anyway, we are here now.  Defending for the Conservatives is Zoë Metcalfe, a project manager for a property asset management company, who sits on North Yorkshire county council and on Harrogate council.  She represents Knaresborough on the county council and Claro ward, which covers a number of villages to the north and east of Knaresborough, on the district council.  Metcalfe has stood for Parliament twice, on both occasions in safe Labour seats (Doncaster Central in 2015, Leeds West in 2017).

Labour have gone for youth in selecting Emma Scott-Spivey, a 23-year-old student paramedic.  Scott-Spivey lives in Thirsk and is the daughter of two police officers.

There are three other candidates on the ballot, headed by independent candidate Keith Tordoff who returns after his third-place finish in May.  Tordoff served as a police officer in Leeds for 20 years, working on the Yorkshire Ripper investigation, and went on to work for the Bank of Scotland; for 20 years he has run the sweetshop at Pateley Bridge, in Nidderdale, and in the 2018 Birthday Honours he was appointed MBE for services to the community.  Also returning from May's election is the Lib Dems' James Barker, a veteran of Iraq and Afghanistan who represents the Rural West York ward on York city council.  Completing the ballot paper is Hannah Barham-Brown, a junior doctor who sits on the council of the British Medical Association; Barham-Brown is the candidate for and deputy leader of the Women's Equality Party.

<h2>Speldhurst and Bidborough</h2>

Tunbridge Wells council, Kent; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Julian Stanyer.

For our discussion of the remaining local by-elections this week we will start in the south and work our way back north.  The Speldhurst and Bidborough ward covers the rural villages to the west of Tunbridge Wells which are part of the Tunbridge Wells district.  As well as the two eponymous villages, the ward extends along the A264 road towards East Grinstead as far as Ashurst, which is the ward's railhead (Ashurst station is on the Uckfield branch line).  Also here is the village of Langton Green, which for many years was home to the factory which made Subbuteo figures.

For many years Speldhurst and Bidborough has been won by the team playing in blue, as you would expect for a leafy middle-class area in west Kent (a majority of the workforce in this ward are in managerial or professional occupations).  However, Tunbridge Wells council has courted controversy in recent years with a now-abandoned plan for a new civic centre in the town which went down with the locals with, for want of a better word, disgust.  The Conservatives performed appallingly here in the May 2019 local elections, with Speldhurst and Bidborough ward being won by the anti-civic centre Tunbridge Wells Alliance group, and there was enough residual disquiet that the ruling Conservatives lost their majority on the council this year.  The Tories currently have 23 seats plus this vacancy, against 13 Lib Dems, 5 seats each for Labour and the Tunbridge Wells Alliance, and an independent; the Conservatives need to hold this by-election in order to retain control via the Mayor's casting vote.

Both of the remaining Conservative seats in Speldhurst and Bidborough came up for election this May following the resignation of councillor Julia Soyke.  After the disaster of 2019 the Tories recovered to hold both seats quite comfortably: shares of the vote were 42% for the Conservatives, 22% for the Tunbridge Wells Alliance and 14% for the Green Party.  Julian Stanyer, a chartered surveyor who had represented the ward since 2008 and was Mayor of Tunbridge Wells in 2014-15, was re-elected in second place; that meant that he would need to finish Soyke's term and seek re-election next May.  As will the winner of this by-election.  The Tories also won with 42% in May in the local county division of Tunbridge Wells West, where the Lib Dems ran second; this is not the strong Lib Dem part of the division.

Defending for the Conservatives is Rowena Stanyer, who will be hoping to take over the seat previously held by her father.  Rowena works as a communications specialist.  The Tunbridge Wells Alliance have reselected their runner-up from May Matthew Sankey, who is a restaurateur.  The Greens have not returned, so the ballot paper is completed by Labour candidate Aleksander Klimanski.

<h2>Bedford</h2>

Wandsworth council, London; caused by the resignation of former Labour councillor Hannah Stanislaus.

We move into Greater London for what may be the last local by-election before all the London borough councillors come due for re-election next year.  This is one of only two council vacancies in the capital at the moment: the other is in the Kenton West of Harrow, which will have one fewer councillor once boundary changes kick in next year, and accordingly nobody seems to be in any hurry to call a by-election there.  However, this column will return to Greater London next week for the Parliamentary Special in Old Bexley and Sidcup.

Before then, we discuss a borough which will be the subject of a lot of column inches in the run-up to next year's elections: the borough of Wandsworth.  This district now has three Labour MPs following the gain of Putney, against the national trend, in the 2019 general election.  However, the Conservatives have run Wandsworth for many years with an aggressive low-council-tax policy, which has found favour with many local residents who would normally vote Labour for other levels of government.

Despite this, Wandsworth council has been trending to the left in recent years.  The 2006 borough elections returned 51 Conservatives and 9 Labour; but by 2018 the Tory lead was down to 33-26, with one independent councillor.  Labour actually topped the poll in the 2018 Wandsworth elections, polling 38.6% against 38.1% for the Conservatives, but their vote was not well distributed.

We can see this leftward shift in the electoral history of Bedford ward, which is named after Bedford Hill and takes in most of Tooting Common.  Tooting Bec underground station, on the Northern Line, lies on the ward boundary.  Unsurprisingly, the area is part of the Tooting constituency.  This is another middle-class ward but is very different in character to Speldhurst and Bidborough.  In the 2011 census Bedford ward made the top 40 wards in England and Wales for full-time employment (57.0%) and for residents with degree-level qualifications (61.1%), was in the top 50 for those employed in professional, scientific and technical activities (19.1%), and was in the top 60 for lower managerial, administrative and professional occupations (33.0%) and for the 30-44 age bracket (31.7%).

Up until the 2014 borough elections Bedford ward had a full slate of Conservative councillors.  In May 2014 Labour gained two seats in the ward, and both of their elected candidates that year went on to become MPs.  Rosena Allin-Khan made it to the green benches just a couple of years later by winning the June 2016 Tooting by-election after Sadiq Khan's election as Mayor of London, while Fleur Anderson was the Labour candidate who gained the Putney constituency in December 2019.

Allin-Khan saw out her term on Wandsworth council, retiring at the 2018 election at which Labour won all three seats in Bedford ward with a large majority of 50-34 over the Conservatives.  Anderson resigned from the council earlier this year to allow a by-election to be held alongside the 2021 London mayor and assembly election: that by-election gave 48% to Labour's Hannah Stanislaus, 32% to the Conservatives and 15% to the Green Party.

We can contrast these results with the Mayor and Assembly elections held on the same day, however some caution as required as the ward breakdowns for those elections do not include postal votes (which were tallied at borough level).  The on-the-day vote in Bedford ward gave the former local MP Sadiq Khan a 54-25 lead over the Conservatives' Shaun Bailey, while in the London Members ballot Labour led with 45% to 26% for the Conservatives and 15% for the Greens.

Hannah Stanislaus' time on Wandsworth council proved to be brief.  Stanislaus left the Labour party at the end of August, citing bullying allegations, and subsequently resigned from the council in October after a couple of months sitting as an independent councillor. <!--No pronouns in this paragraph, please.-->

As such the voters of Bedford ward are being called out for the second by-election here in six months.  Defending for Labour this time is Sheila Boswell, who was the Labour parliamentary candidate for Putney in the 2015 general election and is now chair of the party's Tooting branch.  The Conservatives have reselected Thomas Mytton, who will be hoping for a result which improves on what he got in May's by-election.  The Greens' Roy Vickery returns after standing here in 2014 and 2018; Vickery worked for over 40 years as a botanist at the Natural History Museum in London, and still helps out with the museum's lichen collection as well as lecturing on plant folklore and studying the flora on Tooting Common.  Completing the ballot is Paul Tibbles fro the Lib Dems.

<h2>Bar Pool</h2>

Nuneaton and Bedworth council, Warwickshire; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Patricia Elliott.

We continue our journey north by travelling to Nuneaton, a place this column hasn't profiled in detail since 2015 (and then only for the county council).  There is a lot to catch up on.

The Bar Pool ward lies in western Nuneaton, taking its name from a local brook which opens out into a series of ponds on the ward's northern boundary.  The ward takes in the eastern part of the Stockingford area along the Arbury Road; its eastern boundary is the Coventry Canal, while the ward extends south to take in St Thomas More secondary school.  Nuneaton is an industrial town and this is a strongly working-class area with over 41% of the workforce in routine or semi-routine occupations.  The ward also includes a lot of council housing and Nuneaton's most deprived census district.

Nuneaton and Bedworth is one of the few councils which re-elects half of its members every two years.  Until this year, Bar Pool ward had voted Labour in every Nuneaton and Bedworth election since the current boundaries came into force in 2002, with one exception.  That was 2008, when the British National Party came through the middle of a tight race between Labour and the Conservatives: the winning BNP candidate that year polled 663 votes, the Conservatives 650 and Labour 624.  There has often been a strong Conservative vote here, but they could never break through until this year.

The May 2021 Nuneaton and Bedworth election was a stunning victory for the Conservatives, and its impact was all the greater because this was one of the few councils this year which counted its results overnight after polls closed.  Going into the election Nuneaton and Bedworth had been a hung council with Labour holding 17 seats, half of the total; in opposition to them were 13 Conservatives, 3 councillors from a Tory splinter group and a Green.  In a result well out of kilter with what had gone before, the Conservatives won 15 seats this year, out of a possible 17, to take overall control with a strong majority.

That total included ten gains from Labour, one of which was Bar Pool ward where the Conservatives suddenly ran out winners by the score of 56-33.  Let me again stress, this is a ward which had not previously voted Conservative this century.  On the same day the Stockingford division of Warwickshire county council, which has very similar boundaries, turned in a very similar result.

Following the May elections there were just seven Labour councillors left in Nuneaton and Bedworth, with six of them due for re-election next year.  One of those was Patricia Elliott, who has represented Bar Pool ward since 2014; Elliott handed in her resignation last month, and there is just time to squeeze in a by-election before her term finishes.

The difficult task of defending this ward for Labour falls to Abi Olaifa, who is described by the party as a career-driven professional.  Oliafa stood in May in the St Nicolas ward of Nuneaton and Bedworth and in the Coleshill North and Water Orton division of the county council, both of which are more traditionally weak Labour areas.  The Conservatives have gone for youth in selecting Jamie Hartshorn, who works in COVID testing.  Completing the ballot paper is Andrew Heritage for the Green Party.

<h2>Knutton</h2>

Newcastle-under-Lyme council, Staffordshire; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Brian Johnson.

For our other Midlands by-election this week we come to another district where Labour have been under pressure in recent years.  The village of Knutton lies on the edge of the urban sprawl of the Potteries, about a mile to the north-west of Newcastle-under-Lyme town centre.  Knutton lies on the North Staffordshire coalfield, which was still operating into the 1990s, and it remains a strongly working-class village.  The present ward is a cut-down version of the Knutton and Silverdale ward which existed until 2018, and that ward made the top 100 in England and Wales for routine occupations at the 2011 census.

The collieries may have gone, but the site of the mines have now been put to other uses.  Just to the south of the Knutton ward boundary lies Walleys Quarry, a landfill site which has been the scene of one of the most pungent political controversies in recent years.  And when I say pungent, I mean pungent: the place stinks, and has stunk the borough out for years with high levels of hydrogen sulphide emissions.  In September the High Court ruled that the Environment Agency's enforcement action against the landfill site operator had been inadequate, and ordered that action be taken to bring the emissions to safe levels by January next year.  The Environment Agency have come up with a new plan to do this, and we wait to see whether that will work.

While we wait on that one, there's an election to talk about.  Newcastle-under-Lyme council last went to the polls in May 2018, and the only previous result on these boundaries is from that year with Labour beating the Conservatives 75-25.  As will become clear, there's more to this area's local elections results than that.

The previous ward of Knutton and Silverdale was generally Labour but rather complicated.  Its first two elections, in 2002 and 2003, saw the runner-up spot go to Derrick Huckfield, standing for the "Caring Party".  Huckfield then joined UKIP, came close to winning in 2006 and gained the ward in 2007.

Without Huckfield as candidate UKIP struggled to make headway here in 2010, and the ward went to new Labour candidate Gareth Snell who later had a brief term as MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central.  Huckfield then lost his seat to Labour in 2011 by 30 votes.

In 2014 Snell moved to contest Chesterton ward (which he lost), and Labour selected as their candidate for Knutton and Silverdale Baroness Golding, who had been the Labour MP for Newcastle-under-Lyme from 1986 to 2001.  Golding lost the ward to Derrick Huckfield, who returned as a UKIP councillor.  Huckfield left UKIP the following year, and ended up in the Conservatives.

The 2018 Newcastle-under-Lyme elections were held in the wake of a damning report into the running of the 2017 general election here (<em>Andrew's Previews 2017</em>, page 374).  That report led to the resignation of the Labour leader of the council and the installation of a Conservative-led administration.  The 2018 borough elections returned a hung council, with the Conservatives polling more votes than Labour but winning fewer seats: 20 Labour councillors were returned, 18 Conservatives, 3 independents and 3 Lib Dems.  Huckfield sought re-election in the new Silverdale ward, this time with the Conservative nomination, and lost.  The Tory-led administration continued.

Since 2018 Labour have lost a by-election in Holditch and Chesterton ward to an independent candidate (<em>Andrew's Previews 2019</em>, page 64).  All four independent councillors joined the Conservative group earlier this month: together with a previous defection from the Lib Dems, that means that the Tories now have a majority on Newcastle-under-Lyme council.

This builds on excellent Conservative results at other levels of government.  The Newcastle-under-Lyme constituency (which is rather more urban than the district) was a gain for the former <em>Krypton Factor</em> superperson Aaron Bell in December 2019, and the Conservatives won a full slate of Staffordshire county council seats in the district in May.  That full slate included an excellent performance for Derrick Huckfield, who convincingly gained the Keele, Knutton and Silverdale county division from Labour.  Huckfield had previously won the division in 2013 for UKIP, defeating Labour's Gareth Snell by two votes.

This by-election is a straight fight.  Defending for Labour is Steph Talbot, who stood in May's county council elections for Newcastle South division; she runs Alice, a charity supporting disadvantaged and vulnerable families in Newcastle and Stoke.  Challenging for the Conservatives is county councillor Derrick Huckfield.  Despite the 3:1 margin in favour of Labour three years ago, this column would rate Huckfield as favourite.

<h2>Oxton</h2>

Wirral council, Merseyside; caused by the death of Liberal Democrat councillor Andy Corkhill.

For our Liberal Democrat defence of the week we are well and truly in the land of the plastic Scouser.  The Birkenhead suburb of Oxton, located south-west of the town centre and well away from the riverfront, has for well over a century been the sort of place where people who work in Liverpool and have money prefer to live and commute from.  The 2011 census showed Oxton to be the most middle-class ward in the Birkenhead constituency, and the ward's fine Victorian houses show that this status has been maintained for generations.

This being Merseyside, that doesn't translate to Oxton being a Conservative-voting area.  Instead this has been a Liberal Democrat ward, with one exception, throughout this century.  Oxton was safely Lib Dem until the advent of the Coalition, and then turned into a Lib Dem-Labour marginal in line with Merseyside's lurch to the left.  However, Labour were only able to break through once, in 2015.  In recent years the Lib Dems have pulled away again and the ward has reverted to safety: May's result gave the Liberal Democrats 57% against just 26% for Labour.

That rise provided an opportunity for Lib Dem rising star Andy Corkhill, who was elected in May 2019 and recovered the seat his party had lost to Labour four years earlier.  Corkhill went on to be the Lib Dem candidate for the Wirral West constituency in the December 2019 general election, and he had been selected as the party's candidate for the recent Liverpool City Region mayoral election.

Unfortunately, Andy Corkhill had to give that up after being diagnosed with cencer.  His health continued to decline after surgery in February, and he passed away in October at the appallingly early age of 36.

The resulting by-election is unlikely to affect control of Wirral council.  This has swung in recent years between Labour majorities and hung councils; the 2021 election brought in another hung phase.  Currently, 30 Labour councillors form a minority administration against 23 Conservatives, 5 Lib Dems plus this vacancy, 5 Greens and two independents.

Defending for the Liberal Democrats is Orod Osanlou, a consultant physician in clinical pharmacology and therapeutics; he was one of the doctors working on the clinical trial of the Novavax COVID vaccine, which at the time of writing is awaiting approval from the UK medical regulator.  Labour have selected Sue Mahoney, who stood in May in the neighbouring ward of Birkenhead and Tranmere: she resoundingly lost to the Green Party a seat which Labour were defending.  Also standing are Philip Merry for the Conservatives and Mary Heydon for the Green Party.

<h2>Maryport South</h2>

Allerdale council, Cumbria; caused by the disqualification of independent councillor Peter Little.

We finish the week as we started: with elected representatives saying stupid things.

There has been a harbour for centuries on the coast of West Cumbria, at the point where the River Ellen flows into the sea.  The first record of Maryport is in AD 122, under the name of <em>Alauna</em>, when it was a Roman port: part of the coastal defences on the Solway Firth which were developed at the same time as Hadrian's Wall.

Similar to Whitehaven further down the coast, modern Maryport is a planned settlement dating from the eighteenth century.  Its developer was Humphrey Senhouse, who obtained an Act of Parliament in 1749 to construct the town at a location then known as Ellenfoot; Senhouse renamed the settlement as Maryport, after his wife.  The town became a major port for the Cumberland coalfield, and there were a number of pits in the area.  In the 1840s Maryport was linked to the railway network with the opening of the highly-profitable Maryport and Carlisle Railway.

Maryport is part of the Allerdale district of Cumbria, which also takes in Workington, Keswick and a large agricultural area between the mountains and the Solway coast.  Allerdale council got new wards at its last election in 2019, and Maryport South (which covers the southern half of the town plus the pit village of Broughton Moor) is an expanded version of the previous Ewanrigg ward.  The 2011 census placed Ewanrigg in the top 80 wards in England and Wales for adults with no qualifications (42.2%) and for those working in construction (13.4%), and in the top 30 for those in routine (25.6%) and semi-routine (25.0%) occupations.  There are few wards more working-class than this.

Although Workington has a Tory MP these days, Maryport is Labour at other levels of government.  The last Cumbria county council elections, in May 2017, returned a Labour councillor for the Maryport South division (which is larger than this ward) with a big majority.  In its previous contests this century Ewanrigg ward had been safe Labour, and nobody bothered to stand against the Labour slate in 2003.

Things changed in the 2019 Allerdale elections, when Labour lost a seat in the new Maryport South ward to independent candidate Peter Little.  Shares of the vote were 43% for the Labour slate, with long-serving councillor Carni McCarron-Holmes re-elected at the top of the poll, and 39% for Little who had a majority of 23 votes over the second Labour candidate.

Peter Little has a bulging record in the Councillors Behaving Badly file.  In May this year he got into a parking dispute with his neighbours while extremely drunk; the police were called and Little was arrested after his behaviour got worse.  He was taken to Workington police station where he insulted and homophobically abused police officers; behaviour which continued even after he had spent a night in the cells sobering up.  Little pleaded guilty to three public order offences; in August the magistrates' court sentenced him to 12 weeks in prison, suspended.  He was kicked out of the independent group on Allerdale council, but kept his position as a councillor: the threshold at which councillors are disqualified for convictions is 13 weeks' imprisonment, and Little's sentence was one week short of that.

A month later Little was back before the magistrates <em>again</em>, having sent an email on 9 September to the chief executive of Allerdale council in offensive terms, making threats against him and Mark Jenkinson, the Conservative MP for Workington.  Little pleaded guilty to sending an email that was grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character, and the case was adjourned for pre-sentence reports.  His sentencing hearing was scheduled for 18 October.

On that day, the news was dominated by the killing of the Conservative MP Sir David Amess, which had happened three days earlier.  Workington magistrates, no doubt seeking to send a message loud and clear that abuse of public servants and elected representatives will result in consequences, sentenced Peter Little to six weeks in prison for the threatening communication <em>and</em> activated the 12-week suspended sentence for the public order offences, the two sentences to run consecutively.

You can't really blame the Allerdale council staff for wanting to get this idiot off their council as soon as possible.  The council added 6 weeks and 12 weeks together, noticed that the sum came to more than the 13-week threshold, and promptly pronounced Little to be disqualified.  A by-election was just as promptly called to replace him.

The by-election comes with Allerdale council rather evenly balanced between the three main groups.  The Conservatives are in minority control but only hold 18 of the 49 seats; opposing them are 17 independents (plus this vacancy) and 13 Labour councillors.

One new independent candidate has come forward: he is Eric Galletly, a retired electrician who has been endorsed by the council's independent group.  Labour have selected Bill Pegram, who is a Maryport town councillor and former Mayor of Maryport; he contested Maryport North in the 2019 Allerdale elections.  The Conservatives' Steve Newton completes the ballot paper.
