Five by-elections on 11th November 2021:

<h2>University and Scotforth Rural</h2>

Lancaster council; caused by the resignation of Jack O'Dwyer-Henry.





, so there will be no more by-elections in those areas outside of washup from


O'Dwyer-Henry was originally elected for Labour, but subsequently left the party and was sitting on Lancaster council as an "Eco-Socialist Independent".  After graduating from Lancaster University this year, he has returned to his native Belfast and has taken up a new job with the Green Party Northern Ireland.

We have reached the second week of November, which as long-term readers of Andrew's Previews know can mean only one thing: it is now time for your columnist to mount the pulpit and read out the following notice.

The six-month rule has now come into effect as we approach the next ordinary local elections on Thursday 5 May 2022.  What this means is that from now on, if a councillor who was due for re-election in May 2022 dies, resigns or gets disqualified, then there will be no by-election to replace them and their seat will be left vacant.

The May 2022 local elections will see all local councillors in Greater London, Scotland, Wales, Birmingham, Huntingdonshire, Newcastle-under-Lyme, St Helens and South Cambridgeshire up for election, together with one-third or one-half of those councils which hold elections by thirds or halves (generally, these are boroughs and districts in urban England outside London).  If the government gets its act together, we may also have some form of elections to a new local government structure in Cumbria, North Yorkshire and Somerset.

My list of council vacancies currently has two entries in London (not counting the parliamentary vacancy in Old Bexley and Sidcup), four in Scotland and six in Wales (one of which, in Torfaen, has been left vacant for over six months now and nobody appears to be in any hurry to call it).  Once those are cleared, this column will take its leave of London, Scotland and Wales until the summer of 2022 at the earliest.  The first half of next year is looking likely to be an England-only diet for council by-elections.

So, savour today's two Welsh polls while you can.  We start in the north with a ward in the Dee valley at the southern end of Denbighshire.  Llandrillo yn Edeirnion is a small village to the south of Corwen, in the shadow of the high Berwyn mountains.  This is very much rural Wales.  Llandrillo ward's census return has an unusual feature: 27 of its 489 households were living rent-free, which is the highest proportion for any ward in Wales and in the top 50 for England and Wales.

Cadair Berwyn, on the ward boundary, rises to an altitude of 832 metres and dominates the horizon for a large swathe of western England: on the clearest of days, views from the summit of Cadair Berwyn extend north to the Lake District, over 100 miles away.  The Berwyn range forms an impassable ward boundary to the east: that's something which Henry II, in one of his invasions of Wales, failed to appreciate until it was too late.  His 1165 campaign made the mistake of starting from Oswestry, struck west over the Berwyns, and quicky ground to a halt in military action and terrible weather.  The mountains were also the scene of an obscure incident in January 1974 which some people have claimed to be a UFO crash; the MoD investigation ascribed the loud noise and bright lights on the Berwyns to a combination of a small earthquake, a meteor and poachers.

With its location in the Dee valley rather than the Clwyd valley, Llandrillo yn Edeirnion (together with its sister village of Cynwyd, further down the valley) is a rather poor fit for modern Denbighshire.  Indeed, until its transfer to Clwyd in the 1974 reorganisation, this ward was a part of Merionethshire.  So from February 1974 until the parliamentary boundaries caught up in 1983, Llandrillo was represented by the Plaid Cymru MP Dafydd Elis Thomas.

Thomas was the Baby of the Commons between the two 1974 elections (he was aged 27 when first elected), and his long career in politics didn't finally come to an end until May this year when he retired from the Senedd.  He was the leader of Plaid Cymru from 1984 to 1991, has been a member of the House of Lords (as Lord Elis-Thomas) since 1992, was Presiding Officer of the Welsh Assembly (as the post was then known) from 1999 to 2011, and finished his political career from 2017 to 2021 as an independent MS and as a junior minister in the Welsh Government.

Lord Elis-Thomas sat in the Senedd until 2021 for Dwyfor Meirionnydd, the successor to the Merioneth constituency he had first won 47 years earlier.  Upon his retirement that seat was recovered for Plaid Cymru by Mabon ap Gwynfor.  A grandson of the first Plaid Cymru MP Gwynfor Evans, Mabon started his political career in 2004 by being elected to Aberystwyth town council; he made the step up to principal council level in May 2017 by winning the Llandrillo division of Denbighshire without a contest.  His new Senedd constituency borders his old ward.

The Welsh Government have recently tightened up the rules on "double-jobbing" by elected representatives.  Local councillors who are elected to the Senedd are now required to resign their council seat unless they are in or entering the final year of their council term.  As the next Welsh council elections are due in May 2022 this exception applied to Mabon ap Gwynfor, who was eligible to finish his term on Denbighshire council but would need to stand down from either the Senedd or the council in May next year.  Mabon was not required to resign his council seat before May, but he has chosen to do so.

Mabon ap Gwynfor had previously sought election in the 2011 Senedd election and the 2015 Westminster election as Plaid Cymru candidate for the Clwyd South constituency, which has covered Llandrillo since the 1997 election.  (In that year the Conservative candidate for Clwyd South was one Boris Johnson; answers on a postcard to the usual address as to what happened to him.)  Clwyd South was a Conservative gain from Labour in December 2019 making this area technically part of the Red Wall, but the seat re-elected its Labour MS Ken Skates quite comfortably in May.

These figures are unlikely to be replicated in this by-election, not least because there is no Labour candidate.  Mabon ap Gwynfor's predecessor as ward councillor was Plaid's Cefyn Williams, who was re-elected for his penultimate term of office in 2008 with 78% of the vote.  After that experience, nobody bothered to oppose Plaid here in either 2012 or 2017.

The 2017 election left Denbighshire council very evenly balanced, with 16 Conservative councillors, 13 Labour (mostly from Rhyl), 9 Plaid, 8 independents and a Lib Dem.  All the parties except Labour are represented in the ruling administration.

So this by-election is the first contested local election for Llandrillo in 13 years.  Defending for Plaid Cymru is Gwyneth Ellis, a community councillor in Cynwyd.  The other two candidates both give addresses in Llandrillo: they are independent candidate David Robinson, who was a distant runner-up here in 2008, and Julian Sampson for the Conservatives.

<h2>Heath</h2>

Cardiff council, Glamorgan; caused by the resignation of Heath and Birchgrove Independent councillor Fenella Bowden.

Our other Welsh by-election of the week is quite the contrast, as we travel from Wild Wales to suburban Cardiff.  The Heath ward is a leafy area a few miles to the north of Cardiff city centre: much of the eponymous heath was built on in the inter-war years with spacious houses and large gardens located on tree-lined roads.

Some of the open space survives as Heath Park and Cathays Cemetery, but in 1960s more of the heath disappeared with the construction of the University Hospital of Wales.  Run by the NHS and Cardiff University, UHW is the largest hospital in Wales, and its presence propels Heath ward into the top 100 wards in England and Wales for those working in health or social work (21.1% of the workforce, according to the 2011 census).

The Heath ward extends west across the Caerphilly Road to take in the Birchgrove area.  This is rather lower down the social scale, with terraces rather than semis or detached houses dominating.  Famous former Birchgrove residents include the Tour de France champion Geraint Thomas and the athlete Colin Jackson.

Heath ward has spectacularly volatile voting patterns and has returned councillors from all three main parties this century.  In 2004 it was safely Liberal Democrat, but the Conservatives took two of the ward's seats off the Lib Dems in 2008.  The remaining Lib Dem seat went to newly-elected Fenella Bowden, who subseuently left the party in late 2010: she then formed her own localist party, the Heath and Birchgrove Independents.  The 2012 and 2017 elections here both returned a three-way split between Fenella Bowden, the Conservatives and Labour.  Shares of the vote in May 2017 were 31% for Labour, 28% for the Conservatives and 27% for the Heath and Birchgrove Independents.

Again, this is rather different from the local parliamentary seat.  Heath ward is part of the Cardiff North constituency, a traditional marginal seat which has been trending to Labour in recent years.  Cardiff North was gained by Labour in 2011 for the Senedd and in June 2017 for Westminster, and the Conservatives lost ground here in the last Westminster and Senedd elections.

Fenella Bowden has had some serious health problems over the last couple of years, and she has stood down on health grounds after 13 years in office,.  There is just time to squeeze in a by-election for her seat before the next Cardiff city council elections in May 2022.  To add extra excitement, there is no defending Heath and Birchgrove Independents candidate.  It's a free-for-all!  Labour, who topped the poll here in 2017 and will increase their very small majority on the council with a gain in this by-election, have selected Julie Sangani: she is a healthcare volunteer and school governor at Ton yr Ywen primary school.  The Conservatives have selected Peter Hudson, the husband of their current ward councillor Lyn Hudson.  Also standing are Gwennol Haf for Plaid Cymru and Kathryn Lock for the Lib Dems.
