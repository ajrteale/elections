<h2>St Neots East</h2>

Huntingdonshire council, Cambridgeshire; caused by the election of Labour councillor Nik Johnson as Mayor of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough.

Not all of East Anglia is old.  We now turn to two wards which were entirely developed in the last seventy-five years.  One of these is in a New Town; the other is much newer than that.

The population of Cambridgeshire has rocketed in recent decades, but (with the notable exception of Cambourne) this growth hasn't been achieved by building entirely new developments.  Instead housing estates have been tacked on to the sides of existing towns and villages.  One of these is the Love's Farm development, started in the last ten years and still growing, which took the town of St Neots over to the east side of the East Coast main line for the first time.

Love's Farm became a ward of its own in 2018, under the name of St Neots East.  The development is so new that statistics on it are rather hard to come by.  Figures from the 2021 census are not yet available; at the time of the 2011 census the area was part of a larger St Neots ward, Priory Park, but that was really before the development got going.  The current ward was drawn with a very low 2015 electorate, to allow room for future growth.

This area was only incorporated into St Neots in 2010.  Before then it was part of the now-abolished St Neots Rural parish and the rural ward of Gransden and the Offords.  Love's Farm and other developments have turned St Neots into the largest town in Cambridgeshire without city status, overtaking Huntingdon; and the draft Boundary Commission proposals for the new parliamentary map create a completely new parliamentary seat based on St Neots and the surrounding area.

Huntingdonshire district last went to the polls in 2018, which was a year when the Conservatives did pretty badly in St Neots town.  A localist slate swept two of the town's other wards, while East ward surprisingly saw Labour candidate and local children's doctor Nik Johnson top the poll with 40% of the vote.  Johnson had previously been the Labour parliamentary candidate for the local Huntingdon seat in 2017, putting in a decent performance.  The Conservatives polled 32% and won the ward's other seat, with the Lib Dems close behind on 28%.  Johnson and Tory councillor David Wells' vote totals of 345 and 273 in this two-seat ward were the lowest scores for any winning candidate in Huntingdonshire, including those in the district's single-member wards; as indicated above, this isn't an unusually low turnout but a symptom of the ward having an unusually low electorate.  If the growth forecasts are any good, the population should be a lot larger now than it was three years ago.

Johnson was one of four Labour councillors elected in Huntingdonshire in 2018, and the only one outside Huntingdon town.  He was selected as the Labour candidate for the May 2021 Cambridgeshire and Peterborough mayoral election, campaigning on a ticket to introduce bus franchising to the county and to cancel a plan from the incumbent Conservative mayor, James Palmer, for an "autonomous metro" for Cambridge.  In the first round Palmer topped the poll but only with 41% of the vote, against 33% for Labour's Johnson and 27% for the Lib Dem candidate.  In the runoff an unusually-high 73% of the Lib Dem transfers went to Labour, ensuring that Johnson won in the final reckoning by 113,994 votes to 108,195 (51.3% to 48.7%).  He promptly delivered on part of his manifesto, cancelling the "autonomous metro" project.

The Cambridgeshire county council elections were held on the same day.  This ward is part of the St Neots East and Gransden county division, which the Conservatives lost to an independent candidate by just 9 votes; that was one of the losses which cost them control of the county council, which is now run by a Lib Dem-led coalition of all the other groups.  The Tories remain in control of Huntingdonshire council.

We saw in Batley and Spen last week that Labour are capable of defending by-elections caused by their elected representatives becoming metro mayors.  They will have to repeat that trick here, because Johnson's seat on Huntingdonshire council was vacated as a result of his election to the mayoralty.

Defending for Labour is Helen Stroud.  The Tories have selected Sam Collins, who was on the wrong end of that 9-vote defeat in the county division two months ago.  The Lib Dem candidate is Geoff Seeff, a party veteran who has recently relocated to Love's Farm from Waltham Forest: Seeff has stood for Parliament six times, most recently in Chingford and Woodford Green in 2019, and he was the party's candidate for Havering and Redbridge at the first London Assembly elections in 2000.  Also standing are Lara Davenport-Ray for the Greens (who also stood here in the county elections in May) and independent candidate Ben Pitt, who represents the area on St Neots town council.

<h2>Mark Hall</h2>

Harlow council, Essex; caused by the death of Labour councillor Danny Purton.

Cambridgeshire's approach to population growth has mostly been to tack bits onto existing towns and villages.  The neighbouring county of Essex has taken a different tack, as we see from our other Labour defence today in Harlow.

Harlow is unambiguously a New Town.  It was one of the first New Towns, built in the early 1950s to house families who had been bombed out of London.  One legacy of this history is that the town has the third-highest proportion of social housing of any district in England.  Harlow became an urban district in 1955 and now forms a local government district of its own.

Mark Hall was the first part of the New Town to be completed, and forms two separate residential areas either side of First Avenue, imaginatively named Mark Hall North and Mark Hall South.  In Mark Hall North can be found The Lawn, built in 1951 as the UK's first modern residential tower block.  It is now a listed building.  To the north of Mark Hall North is Temple Fields, a large industrial area next to the River Stort which includes the ward's railway station, Harlow Mill on the West Anglia main line.

This ward has a very strange electoral history.  It was generally Liberal Democrat until 2008, then developed into a Labour ward.  The last Lib Dem councillor for the ward died just before his term was due to end in 2012, and Labour picked the seat up easily.  In 2014 one of the Labour councillors resigned for work reasons, resulting in two of the ward's seats being up for election, and UKIP came from nowhere to win both of them.  One of the UKIP councillors resigned shortly afterards on health grounds; Labour's Danny Purton won the resulting by-election in February 2015, and Labour gained the other UKIP seat in May 2015.

Towards the end of the last decade Harlow was in a rather unusual electoral position.  Since 2010 it had had a Conservative MP, Robert Halfon, whose position was bolstered by the fact that his constituency includes a significant amount of rural territory outside the town.  Since 2017 it had had a full slate of four Conservatives on Essex county council.  But, despite all that, the borough council had a fairly strong Labour majority.  This was partly due to boundary effects, as the Conservative vote in Harlow was not well-distributed.  Most of the party's voters were packed into four safe wards, which meant that in an even year Labour would generally win the ward count 7-4; and the district council election years in 2015-19 were all even years.  In May 2019, despite some well-publicised left-wing infighting among the ruling group, Labour polled 43% of the vote in Mark Hall ward, to 25% for UKIP and 23% for the Conservatives.

So the 2021 Harlow borough elections must have come as a shock.  The Tories won ten of the eleven wards in Mays, some of them for the first time this century, and suddenly found themselves in control of the council with a large majority: they now have 20 councillors, while Labour have 12 left plus this vacancy.  The result in Mark Hall ward in particular was something to behold: 61% for the Conservatives against just 32% for Labour, a swing since 2019 of nearly 25%.

Danny Purton, who had been a senior manager at the council before his election in 2015, passed away a few days before the May election.  The by-election to replce him is looking like a difficult defence for the Labour candidate Kay Morrison, who has previous local government experience.  Before she relocated to Harlow from Scotland, Morrison was a member of Fife council from 1999 to 2017, serving as depute provost of Fife.  She was also the Labour candidate for Mid Fife and Glenrothes in the 2016 Scottish Parliament election.  The Conservative candidate is John Steer, whose wife Jane has fought this ward on a number of occasions in the past.  The ward's regular Lib Dem candidate Lesley Rideout, who lost her council seat here in 2011 and has tried to get it back at every election from 2014 onwards, is having another go; she completes the ballot paper along with Jamie Gilbert of the Green Party.

<h2>Ardingly and Balcombe</h2>

Mid Sussex council; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Andrew Macnaughton.

We travel south of London to the High Weald of Sussex.  The Ardingly and Balcombe ward is a landscape of woods and hills to the south of Crawley; not easy territory through which to thread a railway, and the builders of the Brighton Line had to construct a long tunnel to the north of Balcombe and a long viaduct over the River Ouse to the south of it.  In between is Balcombe railway station, which has brought the area within the range of London commuters.

If Balcombe has a commuter dependence, as do the villages of Pease Pottage and Handcross on the main road from Crawley to Brighton, Ardingly (pronounced "Ardinglye", apparently) has an economic base of its own.  This is partly due to the presence of Ardingly College, a boarding school which propels the ward into the top 100 in England and Wales for the 16-17 age group; a number of future Conservative MPs have passed through Ardingly over the years, and other Old Ardinians include the <em>Private Eye</em> editor Ian Hislop, the author Neil Gaiman and the upper-class twit Tim Nice-But-Dim.  To the north of the village is Wakehurst, a sixteenth-century stately home whose grounds have been taken over by Kew Gardens.  Also here is the South of England Showground, an excellent venue for the sort of events which have been outlawed by the government.

The late councillor Andrew Macnaughton had served this ward as a councillor continuously since 1987.  At the time of his death he was Mid Sussex council's cabinet member for housing and planning.  He had a safe ward, notwithstanding a rather large fall in the Tory vote here in 2019: the Conservative slate polled 39% against 27% for the Liberal Democrats and 23% for the single Green candidate.  In May's election to West Sussex county council election the local Worth Forest county division was much safer for the Tories.

Defending for the Conservatives is Lorraine Nunes-Carvalho, who lives in Brighton: she lives in Balcombe and is a finance director for a company providing services to the hotel and leisure industry.  The Lib Dem candidate is Ben Jerrit, a teacher at Ardingly College who has previously worked behind the camera in the TV and film industry; his credits include a number of episodes of <em>The Bill</em> and <em>EastEnders</em> and a <em>Harry Potter</em> film.  The Greens have selected Jenny Edwards, a business coach and West Hoathly parish councillor.  Completing the by-election is independent candidate Carole Steggles, a parish councillor in Turners Hill (not part of this ward) who also stood here in the county elections two weeks ago.

<h2>Feniton; and<br/>Honiton St Michael's</h2>

East Devon council; caused respectively by the resignations of independent councillor Susie Bond and Liberal Democrat councillor Luke Jeffery.

We finish in the West Country with a trip to the East Devon district.  This is one of the larger second-tier districts, covering nearly everything in Devon to the east of Exeter.  Exmouth is the major town in the district, with other towns including Sidmouth on the coast and, inland, Honiton.

Honiton is an old market town, located on the Fosse Way and the A30 London-Exeter road and known for its Georgian architecture and its traditional lace-making industry.  The Georgian buildings are a byproduct of the town having been mostly destroyed by fire in the mid-eighteenth century; and heat is also a feature of the town's annual Hot Pennies ceremony, dating from the Anarchy, in which warm pennies are thrown from balconies in the High Street to crowds of local people each of July.  The Hot Pennies organisers are hoping for a particularly special event this year on 27th July, to mark the 800th anniversary of Honiton's market charter.  The town is divided into two wards, of which St Michael's is the south-western one.

Immediately to the south-west of Honiton lies the Feniton ward, covering three parishes in the Devon countryside.  Feniton village was greatly expanded by the railways: there was a junction here on the Waterloo-Exeter main line for branch line trains to Sidmouth, and until the 1960s the village's railway station was known as "Sidmouth Junction".  The station then fell victim to the Beeching cuts, but this closure was quickly reversed in 1971.

The Conservatives have badly underperformed in this corner of Devon in recent years.  In the 2019 elections they crashed to 20 out of 60 seats, and the administration was taken over by an independent-led coalition which includes the Lib Dems and Green Party.  The Tories did, however, stop the rot in the 2021 Devon county elections, holding all their seats in the district and gaining a seat from the independents on both the county council and in a district council by-election.  Both of today's by-elections take place within the Feniton and Honiton county division, which swung strongly to Labour but was still safe Conservative.  Given that, what chance of two more Tory gains here?

Well, Honiton St Michael's could be a distinct possibility.  The Conservatives have topped the poll in every election here since 2007, including a by-election in July 2016 (<em>Andrew's Previews 2016</em>, page 130).  On slightly adjusted boundaries, in 2019 the Conservative slate were opposed only by Lib Dem councillor Luke Jeffery who was elected in third place; shares of the vote were 53% for the Conservatives and 47% for the Lib Dems.

For Feniton, however, your guess is as good as mine.  Independent councillor Susie Bond won the ward (then known as "Feniton and Buckerell") at a by-election in May 2013, and has been re-elected twice since with extremely large shares of the vote.  In 2019 she polled 83% against Conservative and Labour opposition.

No independent candidate has come forward to succeed Bond in Feniton, so that's a lot of votes up for grabs.  The Conservatives have picked a candidate with local government experience: Alasdair Bruce, a beekeeper, was a Thanet councillor from 2007 to 2015 and set on that council's cabinet.  The Labour candidate is local resident Linda Baden.  Finally, the Liberal Democrats contest Feniton ward for the first time since 2011; their candidate is Todd Olive, a Warwick University postgraduate student who is fighting his second East Devon council by-election in two months: he was the losing candidate in the Whimple and Rockbeare by-election last May.

For Honiton St Michael's the defending Liberal Democrat candidate is Jules Hoyles, a former chairman of the party's Tiverton and Honiton branch.  He fought Axminster in May's county elections.  Returning for the Conservatives is the winner of the 2016 by-election, Jenny Brown; in 2019 she attempted to transfer to the town's other ward, Honiton St Paul's, but lost to her running-mate by one vote.  Due to what appears to be an error in her nomination papers, she will appear on the ballot paper as "Brown Jenny".  Completing the Honiton St Michael's ballot paper is Labour's Jake Bonetta, who put in a creditable performance here in the county council elections in May.
