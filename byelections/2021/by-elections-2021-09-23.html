Six by-elections on 23rd September 2021, and we've got a bit of a Liberal Democrat special this week with the party defending three of the seats up for election.  Including our first one:

<h2>Kendal North</h2>

South Lakeland council, Cumbria; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Jon Owen.

We start the week in the last bastion of Liberalism in the North of England.  Welcome to Kendal, the once and possibly-future main town of Westmorland and the southern gateway to the Lake District: the main road and railway line to Windermere both pass Kendal.

This is an old town with notably grey architecture, thanks to the local stone.  Textiles were traditionally the main industry in Kendal, but the town is also known for an unusual food export, the energy snack known as Kendal Mint Cake.  Eat this and your body will thank you for the energy boost, but (given its extremely high sugar content) your teeth might not be as happy.  A number of rival mint cake factories still operate in Kendal today.

The town's proximity to the Lakes makes Kendal a favourite base for Kendal Mint Cake's largest market: mountaineers.  Alfred Wainwright, whose <em>Pictorial Guides to the Lake District</em> are still the industry-standard guidebook to the Lakes more than sixty years after their first publication, wrote those books while he had a day job in Kendal Town Hall as the borough treasurer.

Kendal borough council has been succeeded by South Lakeland district council, which is still under the political spell cast by the former Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron.  Farron has been the MP for the local seat of Westmorland and Lonsdale since 2005, and he achieved that by persuading the former Labour vote in Kendal to defect to the Lib Dems <em>en masse</em>.  Until 2000 there was a decent Labour and Conservative vote in Kendal, and in the 2002 local elections the town's 14 wards returned 7 Lib Dem councillors, 6 Labour and 1 Conservative.  Four years later the Lib Dems won a clean sweep of all 14 wards, with their <em>worst</em> score in any ward being 58% of the vote in Highgate ward.  That gave the party overall control of South Lakeland council, which they are yet to relinquish.  Your columnist had seen nothing similar since until Jason Zadrozny got to work on Ashfield council in Nottinghamshire ahead of the 2019 local elections.

The reason that there were 14 wards for a town the size of Kendal is that South Lakeland had a rather unusual electoral cycle in those days, combining a predominantly single-member ward pattern with thirds elections.  The LGBCE told them to they had to drop one or the other ahead of a boundary review implemented for the 2018 local elections; the council decided to keep thirds elections, and the review reorganised Kendal (plus the parish of Natland to the south) into four wards returning three councillors each and a fifth ward of two councillors.

The two-seat ward is Kendal North, which is based on the former wards of Strickland and Underley.  It covers the town's north-west corner, between the River Kent and the Windermere Road.  The former Kendal Underley ward was based on Hallgarth, a council estate built just after the Second World War, and in the 2011 census Kendal Underley made the top 50 wards in England and Wales for part-time employment (18.9% of those of working age) and the top 70 wards for the ONS employment classification "Wholesale and retail trade; repair of motor vehicles and motor cycles", with 23.5% of the workforce in this rather broad category.

Underley ward was represented from 2014 to its abolition in 2018 by Matt Severn, one of Andrew's Previews' most ardent fans.  Severn transferred to Kendal West ward in 2018, and Kendal North was won by the Lib Dem slate with a rather low vote share of 38%, against 27% for the Green Party and 21% for the Conservatives.  That is the only previous result on the current boundaries: the ward was not up for election in 2019, and the 2021 South Lakeland and Cumbria county council elections were cancelled in advance of a reorganisation of Cumbria's local government.  The ward forms part of the Kendal Strickland and Fell county division, which was safely Liberal Democrat when last contested in May 2017.

This by-election results from the resignation last month of Liberal Democrat councillor Jon Owen, who was first elected in 2018.  Owen has also left the Liberal Democrats and switched his allegiance to the Green Party.  He would have been up for election last May had those elections gone ahead; right now it's anyone's guess how long his successor will serve for.

Defending for the Liberal Democrats is Jonathan Cornthwaite, a manufacture technician and Kendal town councillor.  The Green Party have selected Liz Hendry, a retired teacher.  The Conservative candidate is Aron Taylor who, according to a local newspaper report, is concentrating on residents' issues "from stamping out dog fouling ('not literally, thankfully') through to ensuring 'council tax is kept as low as possible'".  Completing the ballot paper is Virginia Branney for Labour.

<h2>Cuddington</h2>

Epsom and Ewell council, Surrey; caused by the death of Residents Association of Cuddington councillor Rob Foote.

We stay within the London area and the M25 but jump just over the Greater London boundary, although that's rather difficult to notice here on the ground.  Cuddington was mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 with 28 households; all of these were swept away after Henry VIII bought the manor in 1538.  Henry had the village demolished shortly afterwards to make way for the Great Park surrounding Nonsuch Palace, and presumably he had some good hunting around here.

The Great Park subsequently took the name of Edward Somerset, the fourth Earl of Worcester, who was an important figure in the court of James I.  James appointed Worcester as Keeper of the Great Park in 1606, and the Earl promptly built Worcester Park House as a residence for himself.  (Worcester was a distant ancestor of Daniel Boone, the American frontiersman.)  The house was home successively to two major figures of the English Civil War, Thomas Pride (who died here in 1658) and Sir Robert Long, and Samuel Pepys visited Long at Worcester Park House in 1665.  Because of the Great Plague, the Exchequer had been evacuated to Nonsuch at that time.

Worcester Park House was destroyed by fire in 1948, by which time the park had been filled with houses as another London suburb.  The railways had come here in 1859 and Worcester Park railway station (just outside the ward's north-east corner) has regular trains to London Waterloo.  The part of Worcester Park that lies in the Epsom and Ewell borough is a very affluent area, and it successfully fought off the threat of incorporation into Greater London in the 1960s.

Epsom and Ewell borough dates from the 1930s, when most of the houses in this ward were built.  For the whole of its existence it has been controlled by Residents Association councillors, and Cuddington ward is part of the Residents' majority.  At the last borough elections in May 2019 the Residents Association of Cuddington slate polled 65% of the vote, with the Lib Dems finishing as runner-up on 13% just ahead of the Conservatives.

May 2019 was a very poor election for the Surrey Conservatives in general.  Since 2001 the MP for Epsom and Ewell has been international laughing stock Chris Grayling, who was at the height of his infamy as transport secretary in early 2019.  Grayling proved to be so incompetent in a series of Cabinet posts that he failed to make the Johnson governments.  Two years later in the May 2021 Surrey county elecions, the Conservatives did recover second place in the Ewell Court, Auriol and Cuddington county division although they were still thrashed 66-14 by the Residents.

Rob Foote had served as a district councillor for Cuddington since 2003.  He was Mayor of Epsom and Ewell in 2014-15.  He spent 30 years working in the airline industry as an engineer, and also worked as an MoT tester and ran a car servicing business.  His wife Rosemary, who passed away from breast cancer at the end of last year, had worked for many years with ITN and was a behind-the-scenes veteran of several ITV general election nights.

On 31 July Rob Foote was at the Brands Hatch racecourse in Kent, working as a volunteer marshal at a motor racing event organised by the British Automobile Racing Club.  A car spun off the track into Foote and another marshal, and Foote died of his injuries at the scene.  He was 67 years old.  Tributes to him were led by the Formula 1 world champion Lewis Hamilton, who described volunteer marshals like Foote as "heroes" who make racing possible.  Kent Police identified no suspicious circumstances and were working with BARC to provide a report for the coroner.

This by-election is to fill the seat left by Foote following his tragic death.  Defending for the Residents Association of Cuddington is Graham Jones, a professional musician with a glittering former career in the Corps of Army Music: he retired from the Army in 2011 as senior director of music for the Household Division, with the rank of lieutenant-colonel and a military MBE.  Here he is in action at his farewell concert in November 2011, directing the Band of the Coldstream Guards.

Standing against Jones are Dan Brown for the Liberal Democrats (no, not that one; this Dan Brown works in the HR world), George Bushati for the Conservatives (who was runner-up here in the county elections in May), and Kevin Davies for Labour (who fought this ward in 2019).

<h2>Exe Valley</h2>

East Devon council; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Fabian King.

We finish in the West Country with this week's rural ward.  The Exe Valley ward of East Devon consists of seven parishes lying immediately to the north of Exeter.  The largest of these, with 524 electors on the roll, is Stoke Canon, which lies between the River Exe to the west and the River Culm to the east; the Great Western railway line runs through Stoke Canon, and stray cinders from a steam locomotive were responsible for a devastating fire here in 1847.  (In an interesting link with the previous section, Stoke Canon was the location where George Boone III, grandfather of the American frontiersman Daniel Boone, was baptised.)  The Exe and the Culm are in wide valleys here and have changed their meanders over the years, but the parish boundaries haven't been updated to match resulting in a number of places where the ward includes territory which is now cut off on the far side of the Exe.

The Exe Valley ward is rather out on a limb in a corner of East Devon district, which is based in Honiton and whose main focus is the towns and countryside to the east of Exeter.  East Devon council was run by the Conservatives until 2019, when they lost their majority and an independent-led coalition took over.  That coalition includes the Liberal Democrats, which makes Exe Valley ward something of a bellwether: it was held by the Conservatives until 2015, then gained by the Lib Dems (on revised boundaries, with the parish of Poltimore added) in the 2019 election.  That election was a straight fight here between the Conservatives and Lib Dems, who won 57-43.  The ward is part of the Broadclyst division of Devon county council, which split its two seats in May between the Green Party and the Conservatives.

East Devon has been going through a rash of by-elections recently: this is the fourth poll in the district this year.  All of the previous three polls resulted in a change of party: the Conservatives picked up Whimple and Rockbeare ward in May and Feniton in July from independent councillors, and the Lib Dems resoundingly lost a by-election in Honiton St Michael's ward to Labour in July.

None of those by-elections had any independent candidates, and that pattern continues here in the Exe Valley by-election which follows the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Fabian King.  He has stepped down to focus on his business interests.

Defending for the Liberal Democrats is Jamie Kemp, an environmentalist, beekeeper, tailor and stay-at-home dad who was the party's candidate here in the Devon county elections four months ago.  The Conservatives have reselected Kevin Wraight who lost here in 2019: by his own account he lives in Stoke Canon and is recently retired.  There will be more choice for the electors here, as Michael Daniell compeltes the ballot paper for Labour.
