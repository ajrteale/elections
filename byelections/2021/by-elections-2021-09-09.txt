Six by-elections on 9th September 2021:

<h2>Cleadon and East Boldon</h2>

South Tyneside council, Tyne and Wear; caused by the disqualification of councillor Jeff Milburn.

Jeff Milburn has followed in the tradition of David Potts by trashing his reputation with his own destructive behaviour.  He was elected to South Tyneside council in May 2018 as a Conservative candidate.  In 2019 he was thrown out of the Conservative party following claims - which he denied - that he had used racist language.  From what happened next, it would appear that the party is well rid of him.

Some time later Milburn was stopped by police in Northumberland who suspected him of drink-driving.  He was charged with failing to provide a specimen and the case was sent to South Tyneside magistrates, who imposed an 18-month driving ban and a 12-month community order.  Milburn appealed against the sentence, and his driving licence was returned pending the outcome of his appeal.

On his way into that court hearing in January 2020, Milburn was searched by the court's security team who found that he was carrying a lock knife.  He was charged with possession of a bladed article, and at a subsequent hearing in July 2020 South Tyneside magistrates imposed a four-month suspended prison sentence and another community order, also ordering that the weapon be destroyed.  Milburn appealed against that sentence, too.

In March 2020 Jeff Milburn went into a drunken meltdown during a family dinner, and the police were called to his home.  A subsequent search found a number of swords, machetes and air weapons at Milburn's home along with two antique shotguns, in poor but working condition, which it was illegal for him to possess without a licence.  At a hearing last month Milburn pleaded guilty to two firearms charges, and Newcastle Crown Court imposed a 20-month suspended prison sentence.

By this point Jeff Milburn had finally been kicked off South Tyneside council because of the knife conviction.  The four-month suspended prison sentence for that offence disqualified him from being a councillor, but the disqualification could not kick in until Milburn's appeal against the sentence was disposed of.  Which is why this by-election is only being held now.
