Nine by-elections on 18th November 2021:

<h2>Gorrell</h2>

Canterbury council, Kent; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor George Caffery.  A former firefighter, Caffery was first elected in 2019.

<blockquote>
'The time has come,' the Walrus said,<br/>
'To talk of many things:<br/>
Of shoes &mdash; and ships &mdash; and sealing wax &mdash;<br/>
Of cabbages &mash; and kings &mdash;<br/>
And why the sea is boiling hot &mdash;<br/>
And whether pigs have wings.'
</blockquote>

Oysters anyone?  We start last week as we finished the previous week: in north Kent, this time visiting the seaside town of Whitstable.  Whitstable has been known for its oysters since Roman times, but the modern town really got going in the mid-eighteenth century when a ferry service to London and a turnpike road to Canterbury were introduced.

From here on the town became a minor port and seaside resort, something which was enhanced in 1830 with the opening of the Canterbury and Whitstable Railway.  Known from its initials as the "Crab and Winkle", the C&WR was one of the UK's first railways and was the first railway in the world to issue passenger season tickets (in 1834).  Its original locomotive, <em>Invicta</em>, is now on display in the town.  The railway terminated at Whitstable harbour, providing a port for the city of Canterbury.

The present Gorrell ward, named after a local stream, was created in 2015 as a merger of two previous wards: a smaller Gorrell ward plus the former Harbour ward which covered the town centre.  In the period 2003-11 Harbour ward was safely Labour while Grorell was marginal; the new ward has also proven to be marginal.  In 2015 Gorrell split its representation between two Conservatives and one Labour councillor.  Labour won all three seats in 2019 as the Conservatives fell to third place, the Green Party surging into a close second: the lead Green candidate finished just nine votes behind the third Labour candidate.  Shares of the vote were 37% for Labour, 34% for the Greens and 23% for the Conservatives.

Gorrell ward also forms part of a marginal division of Kent county council: Whitstable West, which swung strongly to Labour in May.  It's also part of a marginal Parliamentary seat.  The Canterbury constituency was possibly the most unexpected of the Labour gains in the 2017 general election, with Rosie Duffield becoming the city's first-ever Labour MP with a majority of 187; despite some travails with her local party, she increased her majority in 2019.

<blockquote>
But four young Oysters hurried up.<br/>
All eager for the treat:<br/>
Their coats were brushed, their faces washed,<br/>
Their shoes were clean and neat &mdash;<br/>
And this was odd, because, you know,<br/>
They hadn't any feet.
</blockquote>

The Labour selection produced as their defending candidate Dane Buckman, a self-employed gardener.  Standing for the Greens is Clare Turnbull, who works in educational research.  The Conservative candidate is Stephen Spencer.  Completing the ballot paper is our fourth candidate Colin Gardner, standing for the Workers Party of Britain.

<blockquote>
'O Oysters,' said the Carpenter,<br/>
'You've had a pleasant run!<br/>
Shall we be trotting home again?'<br/>
But answer came there none &mdash;<br/>
And this was scarcely odd, because<br/>
They'd eaten every one.

<h2>Bere Ferrers</h2>

West Devon council; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Robin Musgrave.

For our Liberal Democrat defence of the week we have come to the West Country, for a ward on the Devon side of the Tamar Estuary.  The Bere peninsula lies at the head of the estuary between the Tamar to the west and the Tavy to the east; its main population centre is the village of Bere Alston.

The city of Plymouth is only a few miles away, but the road connections to it are so poor (thanks to the Tavy estuary) that the railway line from Plymouth to Bere Alston managed to survive the Beeching cuts which had recommended it for closure.  Bere Alston and Bere Ferrers were once on the second main line from Plymouth to Exeter via Okehampton, and trains now reverse at Bere Alston to take the former branch line to Gunnislake.  The section of line between Okehampton and Exeter is due to reopen to passengers this weekend, but reopening of Okehampton to Bere Ferrers is a rather more distant prospect.

Bere Alston was one of most notorious of the rotten boroughs which were swept away by the 1832 Reform Act.  Sir George Beaumont, the artist and art patron who was one of the founders of the National Gallery in London, was an MP for Bere Alston from 1790 to 1796.  By the 1830s elections here were controlled by the Duke of Northumberland, with the freehold tenants of around 30 houses (out of 112 in the borough) having the right to vote.  A vivid account of the 1830 general election here was published in <em>The Times</em>:
<blockquote>
    "Dr Butler [the Portreeve, who was Returning Officer for the borough] ... met the voters under a great tree, the place usually chosen for the purpose of election. During the time the Portreeve was reading the acts of Parliament usually read on such occasions, one of the voters handed in to him a card containing the names of two candidates, proposed by himself and seconded by his friend. He was told ... this was too early. Before the reading was completed, the voter on the other side handed in a card corresponding with the former, which he was told was too late. The meeting broke up. The Portreeve and assistants adjourned to a public house in the neighbourhood, and then and there made a return of Lord Lovaine and Mr Blackett, which was not signed by a single person having a vote."
</blockquote>
The "voting tree" still stands in Bere Alston.  Mr Christopher Blackett here was a colliery owner from Northumberland, while Lord Lovaine came from a cadet branch of the Percy family who were Dukes of Northumberland.  Good local candidates both.  Lovaine entered the Lords the following year after succeeding to the title of Earl of Beverley (he ended up as the 5th Duke of Northumberland), and the resulting by-election in January 1831 was contested: the Tory candidate won it by seven votes to nil.  In the general election four months later the Conservative slate defeated the Whig slate by nine votes to nil.

Modern-day by-elections in Bere Ferrers are rather more democratic than that, although the returning officer did play a crucial role here again in the 2011 election.  The outgoing Lib Dem councillor Robin Musgrave tied for second place with the Conservatives' Andrew Sadleir on 486 votes each; but only one of them could be elected.  Lots were drawn, and the returning officer's casting vote fell on Musgrave.

The Bere Ferrers ward was expanded in 2015 to take in the parish of Gulworthy to the north.  Its two outgoing councillors Robin Musgrave and Mike Benson were re-elected that year, although Musgrave had by then left the Liberal Democrats and gone independent.  Benson died in 2017, and the Conservatives held his seat in the resulting by-election (<em>Andrew's Previews 2017</em>, page 123).

Musgrave, by now back in the Lib Dem fold, topped the poll again here in May 2019, with the Conservatives holding the other seat.  Vote shares are a bit difficult to interpret here because of personal votes and partial slates, but for what it's worth the topline figures were 31% for the Lib Dems, 30% for the Conservatives, 20% for Labour and 18% for UKIP.

The ward is split between two divisions of Devon county council (Yelverton Rural and Tavistock), which were both safely Conservative in May's county elections.  It is part of the Torridge and West Devon constituency represented by the former Conservative cabinet minister Geoffrey Cox, who has been in the news a bit recently.

Robin Musgrave is standing down on health grounds after many years of service as councillor for Bere Ferrers.  He was first elected in 1991, and had continuous service from 2007.  Musgrave served in 2012-13 as Mayor of West Devon.

Defending for the Liberal Democrats is their losing candidate from 2019 Graham Reed, a craftsman in glass; Reed is a former Plymouth city councillor and has contested Plymouth constituencies in the last three general elections.  The Conservatives have selected Angela Blackman, while Labour have changed candidate to Isabel Saxby.  UKIP have not returned, so completing the ballot paper is a former European Parliament and London Assembly candidate: that's local resident Judy Maciejowska of the Green Party.

<h2>Brockworth East</h2>

Tewkesbury council, Gloucestershire; caused by the resignation of independent councillor Sara Stevens.

For our remaining southern by-election we consider a strong contender for the most dangerous Quaint British Tradition.  Every Spring Bank Holiday, a number of people who really should know better race 3 or 4 kilograms of the best Double Gloucester cheese down Cooper's Hill, above Brockworth in Gloucestershire.  With the hillside having a 1-in-3 slope, and the cheese travelling fast enough to injure anyone who gets in its way, someone always gets hurt at the Cooper's Hill Cheese Rolling.  Councillor Sara Stevens, one of the organisers, was herself injured by the cheese when the event was last held in 2019; she ended up in A&E with an internal crush injury.

Cheese-rolling here has been going on for centuries by and for the people of Brockworth, a village on the arrow-straight road going east out of Gloucester.  This was once the Roman road of Ermine Street running towards Cirencester, and just outside the ward boundary are the remains of a Roman villa at Great Witcombe.  In modern times Brockworth was the home of the Gloster aircraft factory, which closed in the 1960s and whose site has now been redeveloped.

Despite being much closer to Gloucester and Cheltenham, the parish of Brockworth is part of the local government district and parliamentary seat of Tewkesbury.  Brockworth's location just outside Gloucester, with good road links, has led to strong population growth in recent years.  Tewkesbury council got new ward boundaries in 2019 as a result of which Brockworth parish went up from three councillors to four; the LGBCE don't draw wards with more than three councillors, so this meant that the parish had to be divided into two new wards.  Accordingly Brockworth East ward came into being.

The old Brockworth ward had four by-elections in the period 2003-19, with one going to a now-defunct residents' party, two to the Liberal Democrats and the last one, in May 2014, to the Conservatives.  The Conservatives followed up by winning all three seats in Brockworth in 2015.  In May 2019 both Brockworth wards returned two independent candidates, with shares of the vote in East ward being 38% for the independents, 24% for the Conservatives, 15% for UKIP and 13% for the Liberal Democrats.  However, the Conservatives held the Brockworth county division in May's Gloucestershire elections with a swing in their favour.

Sara Stevens stood down from Tewkesbury council in June, so there has been plenty of time for prospective candidates in this by-election to get their act together.  Despite this, independent candidate Gareth Evans had his nomination papers rejected by the returning officer on the grounds that the two electors who had signed it do not in fact live within the ward.  Evans will not be on the ballot.  This leaves one defending independent candidate, Brockworth parish councillor Charlotte Mills (who is listed on the parish council website under her previous surname of Parry).  The Conservatives have reselected Ronald Furolo who regularly contests local elections here; Furolo was a councillor for the former Brockworth ward from 2015 to 2019.  UKIP have not returned.  The Lib Dem candidate is Gilbert Yates, who stood in 2019 in the ward of Churchdown Brookfield with Hucclecote, closer to Gloucester.  Completing the ballot paper is Joseph Ambrose for Labour.

<h2>Chorlton</h2>

Manchester council; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Matt Strong.

We now travel east up the Mersey to the other great city of north-west England.  Chorlton-cum-Hardy was historically a village on the north bank of Mersey, three miles from the growing industrial town of Manchester.  The village grew rapidly in the late Victorian era as a middle-class suburb within easy striking distance of the city, and Chorlton was incorporated into Manchester in 1904.  Chorlton tram stop, on the Aisport and East Didsbury lines, has linked the ward to the city centre since 2011.

For those of a certain age, it's impossible to talk about Chorlton without mentioning some of the classic pieces of children's television.  Chorlton was the home of the Cosgrove Hall animation studios, which gave us such great artistic works as <em>Chorlton and the Wheelies</em>, <em>Danger Mouse</em> and <em>Count Duckula</em>, together with feature-length versions of <em>The Wind in the Willows</em> and Roald Dahl's <em>BFG</em>.  Cosgrove Hall's employees included a very young Bernard Sumner, before he found fame in the bands Joy Division and New Order.  The studio ended up as part of ITV, which wound it up in 2009.

Modern-day Chorlton still has that middle-class vibe, with urban professionals dominating its current demographic.  In the 2011 census Chorlton (which then had slightly different boundaries) was in the top 50 wards in England and Wales for those educated to degree level (60.6%), and 30.8% of its population was aged between 30 and 44: that was the highest figure for any ward in north-west England and in the top 100 wards in England and Wales.  A majority of the workforce are in middle-class occupations and full-time employment is very high.  Less salubriously, Chorlton's M21 postcode was reported in 2014 to be the most burgled postcode district in the UK.

Manchester is a monolithically Labour council these days: the latest composition has 93 Labour councillors plus this vacancy, opposed by one Lib Dem (the former Withington MP John Leech) and one Green (for the unlikely-looking Green ward of Woodhouse Park, in Wythenshawe).  Chorlton ward last failed to vote Labour in 2010, when the Liberal Democrats won.  In May this year Labour won with a 68-17 lead over the Green Party, and the Lib Dems fell to fourth place.  Matt Strong had represented Chorlton since 2011, gaining his seat from the Lib Dems.

Defending this by-election for Labour is Matthew Benham, who describes himself on his Twitter as a "Volunteer, Allotmenteer and Leafleting Specialist".  The Green candidate is Simon Milner-Edwards, who describes himself as a single-issue candidate: the issue being  stopping development on Ryebank Fields.  Also standing are Kathleen Fitzgibbon for the Conservatives, Rosie Hughes for the Liberal Democrats, regular candidate Jo Heathcote for the Women's Equality Party, and independent candidate Paul Harnett.

<h2>Bamber Bridge East</h2>

South Ribble council, Lancashire; caused by the death of Labour councillor Christine Melia at the age of 72.  She had served as a councillor since 2019.

For the last of the five Labour defences this week in north-west England we travel north to the edge of Preston.  Bamber Bridge lies a few miles to the south-east of Preston, another link in the chain of towns which links Preston to Chorley.  This a major location on the motorway network: the ward includes the original southern terminus of the UK's first motorway, the M6 Preston Bypass, while the later M61 and M65 motorways also pass through the ward.  Also here is the unnumbered Walton Summit motorway, a spur road which is one of the few places in the UK where you can legally do 70mph on a single-carriageway road.

There's nothing out of the ordinary about the ethnic profile of this ward, but Bamber Bridge has gone down in history as the unlikely location of an American race riot.  The so-called Battle of Bamber Bridge occurred in June 1943 at Ye Old Hob Inn, a pub in Bamber Bridge East ward.  At the time the 1511th Quartermaster Truck regiment, a black-only logistics unit of the US Air Force, was stationed in Bamber Bridge and its members often socialised in Ye Old Hob with the locals, in a way they couldn't do back home in segregated America.  News had come through of race riots in Detroit earlier in the week, and the author Anthony Burgess - who lived in Bamber Bridge for a time - recounted that the US authorities demanded a colour bar in Bamber Bridge's pubs in response.  The landlords promptly put up signs saying "Black Troops Only".  Then a cack-handed attempt by white US military police to arrest a black soldier in the pub, for not wearing the proper uniform, was thwarted by British servicewomen and local civilians; the military police subsequently came back in numbers and there was a firefight which lasted most of the night.  One GI died.  All the other GIs involved were back to normal duties within thirteen months, which was a very light punishment considering that this was a mutiny in wartime; the Eighth Air Force commander put most of the blame for the incident on the behaviour of the MPs.

These days the East ward of Bamber Bridge has a lot of industry, and it has been Labour-voting throughout this century.  In the May 2019 elections to South Ribble council Labour polled 47% here, the Conservatives 30% and UKIP 24%; that election led to the Conservatives losing control of the council, and South Ribble is now run by a minority Labour administration with Lib Dem support.  Until the death of ward councillor Christine Melia in September, the Labour and Conservative groups were tied on 22 seats each; accordingly, if the Conservatives gain this by-election they will become the largest party on the council.

The Tories may take heart from the fact that they represent this area at other levels of governemnt.  Most of Bamber Bridge East ward is covered by the South Ribble East division of Lancashire county council, which is safe Conservative; however, part of it is in the Lostock Hall and Bamber Bridge division which is a Conservative-held marginal.  The ward is part of the Ribble Valley parliamentary seat held by Tory MP Nigel Evans, who returned to his former role as a Deputy Speaker after the 2019 general election.

Defending for Labour is local resident Clare Hunter.  The Conservative candidate is Matthew Forshaw, a maintenance manager for a hospitality company.  UKIP have not returned, but we will still have a three-way contest with the interventino of Rachel Knowles for the Green Party.

<h2>Cropton</h2>

Ryedale council, North Yorkshire; caused by the death of Liberal Party councillor John Clark.

As a warmup for next week's North Yorkshire Police and Crime Commissioner election, we come to, well, North Yorkshire.  Yes, this means that the voters of Cropton are going to have to turn out for by-elections on two successive Thursdays.  Blame the PCC by-election rules for that one.

The Cropton ward of Ryedale covers eight tiny parishes wrapping around the western and northern side of Pickering.  Much of its acreage is within the North York Moors National Park, and those who have travelled the preserved North Yorkshire Moors railway - which runs along the valley of Pickering Beck which forms the ward's eastern boundary - will attest that this is beautiful countryside.  It's not highly populated countryside even in the more lowland parishes, in the fertile Vale of Pickering: Middleton, located on the main road running west from Pickering, is the largest parish in the ward but has just 343 electors on the roll.  There may well have been a larger population at the end of the 1st century, when the Romans had a camp at Cawthorne, just outside Cropton, which is thought to have been used by them as a training camp.

A look at the election results for Cropton ward reinforces the sense of historical throwback.  Since the ward was created in 2003 it has had only one councillor: John Clark, one of the few remaining councillors for the continuing Liberal Party.  Clark went through a number of very close elections - in 2011 he was re-elected with a majority of just six votes over the Conservatives - and it wasn't until his final re-election in 2019 that he achieved safety in Cropton ward.  On that occasion he won with a 55-25 lead over an independent candidate.

Clark had also served on North Yorkshire county council, representing the local Pickering division from 2009 to 2017.  Again, all those elections were photofinishes: Clark won by 58 votes in 2009, was re-elected by 50 votes in 2013, and lost his seat to the Conservatives by eight votes in 2017.

The May 2021 North Yorkshire county elections were cancelled due to possible local government reorganisation in the county.  Ryedale council, which is based on the Vale of Pickering and whose largest towns are Pickering and Norton, may well be one of the main reasons for this reorganisation.  It has a very low headcount and came off badly from the creation of a unitary York council in the 1990s: as part of that process York city council expanded to cover the whole of the city's urban area and a rural hinterland, and that boundary change robbed Ryedale of a large chunk of its population and council tax base.

Ryedale council is too small to sustain a leader and cabinet system of governance, and John Clark's position as chairman of the council's policy and resources committee meant that he was in effect the council leader.  The council chamber is hung, with currently 12 independent councillors (in at least three different groups), 11 Conservatives, 4 continuing Liberals plus this vacancy, and two new-style Liberal Democrats.

Defending this by-election for the Liberal Party is Alasdair Clark, John Clark's son.  The independent from last time has not returned, so opposing Clark junior are Greg White for the Conservatives (who is the local county councillor), Richard McLane for the Green Party and Jill Wells for Labour.
