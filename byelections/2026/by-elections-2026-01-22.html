Five by-elections on 22nd January 2026:
</p><p>
<h2>Glenrothes West and Kinglassie</h2>
</p><p>
<em>Fife council, Scotland; caused by the resignation of Scottish National Party councillor Julie Ford.</em>
</p><p>
Today's selection of five by-elections is varied enough to have something for everyone, with polls in all three nations of Great Britain.  We'll start north of the border in the Kingdom of Fife with one of those wards which is very well described by its name.  This is the western of the three wards covering the New Town of Glenrothes and its hinterland, which in this case includes the ex-mining village of Kinglassie to the west of the town and the former Westfield opencast coalmine, which is now being redeveloped as an energy complex.  A massive "energy from waste" facility has recently come online here.
</p><p>
Most residents of this ward live in areas of New Town development to the west of Glenrothes town centre, including South Parks, Caskieberran and Macedonia.  The south-western part of Glenrothes is generally given over to industrial use as part of the so-called "Silicon Glen", although the Finglassie residential area is within the ward boundary.  Also here is Fife Airport, which despite its grand name is a small aerodrome which is generally used by helicopters and flying clubs.
</p><p>
Like much of central Scotland, Glenrothes is represented by a Labour MP at Westminster and by a Scottish National Party constituency MSP at Holyrood.  The Labour MP is Richard Baker, who was elected in 2024 for the Glenrothes and Mid Fife constituency; he had previously been a Labour regional MSP for North East Scotland from 2003 to 2016, and his wife Claire Brennan is also a Labour regional MSP.  The SNP MSP for Mid Fife and Glenrothes is Jenny Gilruth, who was first elected here in 2016 and has been in the Scottish Cabinet since 2023, as education and skills secretary; she is the wife of Kezia Dugdale, the former Scottish Labour leader.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2022/fife22s.svgz" alt="Fife, 2022" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Glenrothes is the home of Fife council.  The SNP are the largest party on the council, but there is an overall Unionist majority and Labour, as the largest Unionist party, run a minority administration.  The 2022 Fife elections returned 34 SNP councillors, 20 Labour, 13 Lib Dems and 8 Conservatives; the SNP gained a by-election from Labour last November in Buckhaven, Methil and Wemyss Villages ward after the previous Labour councillor was sent to prison for sexual offences, while two Unionist councillors (one elected for Labour, one for the Conservatives) have recently defected to Reform UK.
</p><p>
In Fife local elections Glenrothes is one of the strongest parts of the Kingdom for the SNP, who have won Glenrothes West and Kinglassie ward in all four local elections since proportional representation was introduced in 2007.  There were two by-elections here in 2015, with the SNP gaining one seat from Labour in March and successfully defending a second poll in October to replace councillor Peter Grant, who had been elected to Westminster earlier that year.  Boundary changes in 2017 cut the ward down from four councillors to three, and since then the seats have split two to the SNP and one to Labour; in votes the SNP had a 50-32 lead at the last Fife council elections in 2022.
</p><p>
This by-election is to replace SNP councillor Julie Ford, who had served the ward since winning the October 2015 by-election.  She stood down at the end of October as a result of changes in her personal and professional circumstances.
</p><p>
Defending this seat for the Scottish National Party is Zoe Hisbent, who is seeking to return to Fife council: Hisbent previously represented Kirkcaldy Central ward from 2017 until 2022, when she lost her seat to her running-mate who was higher up the alphabetical ballot paper.  The alphabet is also a disadvantage for Labour candidate Jacob Winton, a recruitment consultant who contested Leven, Kennoway and Largo ward in 2022.  Completing this ballot paper are Andrew Butchart for the Conservatives, Ed Scotcher for the Lib Dems, Danny Smith for the Scottish Family Party and Romano Valente for Reform UK.

<h2>Willaston and Thornton</h2>
</p><p>
<em>Cheshire West and Chester council; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Myles Hogg.</em>
</p><p>
Before we start the next section, a declaration of interest needs to be made.  Ben Walker, the head honcho at Britain Elects, is the election agent for the Labour candidate in our next by-election.  This takes place at the base of the Wirral peninsula.
</p><p>
The village of Willaston lies midway between the Dee and Mersey banks of the Wirral, and it was clearly once quite an important place: back in the mists of time the ancient Wirral Hundred of Cheshire was once the Willaveston Hundred, from an older spelling of Willaston.  (The names "Wirral" and "Willaston" are not etymologically related.)  The Thornton of this ward name is the village of Childer Thornton, which lies on the A41 road just to the north of Ellesmere Port.  In between the two villages is Hooton railway station, which is a major junction and park-and-ride site on the Merseyrail Wirral line: trains from here go north to Birkenhead and Liverpool, south to Chester and east to Ellesmere Port.
</p><p>
Willaston and Thornton ward comes close to spanning the width of the Wirral peninsula.  At the eastern end, only the Vauxhall factory at Ellesmere Port blocks the way to the Manchester Ship Canal and the Mersey estuary; at the western end is saltmarsh crossed by the border between England and Wales, which was set when the main channel of the River Dee took a much more easterly course than it does now.  Land reclamation on the eastern bank of the Dee estuary has mostly been to the benefit of Wales.
</p><p>
So all communication links up and down the Wirral go through this ward including the M53 motorway, which significantly changes in character here.  The M53 was originally intended to be a high-quality 3-lane motorway passing west of Ellesmere Port and running towards Queensferry, with a link to the pre-existing Ellesmere Port Bypass which had been upgraded to a 2-lane motorway of rather lower quality numbered as M531.  When it became clear that the southern section of the M53 was never going to be built, the Ellesmere Port Bypass was renumbered as M53.  To this day the two sections of M53 are joined up by what were clearly intended to be slip roads in a larger junction.
</p><p>
Willaston and Thornton is a ward full of wealthy commuters, and even the left-wing influence that the city of Liverpool transmits to its hinterland can't stop this area voting Conservative in local elections.  In the 2023 elections to Cheshire West and Chester council the Conservatives led Labour here by 61-26.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2023/cheshire-w-chester23s.svgz" alt="CWAC, 2023" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
The Conservatives are however in the minority on Cheshire West and Chester council, which is Labour-controlled.  Willaston and Thornton has also had Labour MPs since 1992, because it was traditionally part of the constituency based on Ellesmere Port; however, boundary changes for 2024 transferred this ward into the Chester North and Neston seat.  This is represented by Labour's Samantha Dixon, a former leader of Cheshire West and Chester council who got into Parliament by winning the City of Chester by-election in 2022 (<em>Andrew's Previews 2022</em>, page 539).  Dixon is now a junior frontbencher at the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government.
</p><p>
This by-election is to replace a political veteran.  (Andrew) Myles Hogg's career in elected office went all the way back to 1987, when he was first elected as an Ellesmere Port and Neston councillor for Whitby ward.  He lost that seat to Labour in 1995, but returned the following year as a councillor for Willaston and Thornton ward which he represented until Ellesmere Port and Neston council was abolished in 2009.  In 2008 Hogg was elected to the successor Cheshire West and Chester council for Ledsham and Willaston ward; after boundary changes in 2011 recreated Willaston and Thornton ward Hogg returned there, and he continued to serve the ward until his death in November at the age of 84.  His political offices included serving as mayor of Ellesmere Port and Neston, and Sheriff of Chester.
</p><p>
A hard act to follow for the defending Conservative candidate Sion Roberts, who lives within the ward in Childer Thornton and runs a bespoke PC manufacturing firm.  Labour have nominated their local branch chairman Edd Flynn, who is a probation officer.  Also on the ballot are Scott Fulton-Brown for the Greens, Carol Braithwaite for the Lib Dems and Richard Hare for Reform UK.

<h2>Leeswood</h2>
</p><p>
<em>Flintshire council, North Wales; caused by the death of Labour councillor Ray Hughes.</em>
</p><p>
We don't have to go far from the Wirral to reach our first Welsh by-election of 2026.  The village of Leeswood lies a few miles to the south-east of Mold, on high ground overlooking the River Alyn.  It lies off the main road from Mold towards Wrexham, which runs down in the valley.
</p><p>
The economy of Leeswood was traditionally built on mining, and not just of minerals in the immediate area.  In the early 18th century the local squire was George Wynne, who owned land on Halkyn Mountain overlooking the Dee estuary.  The Romans had extracted lead from Halkyn Mountain, but it wasn't until the 1700s that lead deposits were rediscovered there; this turned Wynne into a very rich man.  He spent that fortune on a political career (he was the MP for the Flint Boroughs from 1734 to 1742) and on the 18th-century country house of Leeswood Hall and its associated grounds.  These grounds terminate in the White Gates, a 100-foot wide screen of magnificent 18th-century ironwork next to the minor road from Leeswood village to Mold.  The White Gates are listed at Grade I, whereas the hall is only Grade II*.
</p><p>
Leeswood itself had a colliery back in the day, and it has left its mark on history thanks to some serious unrest here in 1869.  The Leeswood Green colliery was being managed at that time by a Durham man called John Young, who was on poor terms with his miners.  Matters boiled over when Young banned the use of the Welsh language underground and then announced a pay cut shortly afterwards, and a group of miners from the pit attacked Young before depositing him at the nearest police station and, just to prove the point that Young was not wanted in Leeswood, carrying all the furniture in his house off to the nearest railway station.  The ringleaders were tried by Mold magistrates the following month and sentenced to a month's hard labour.  This verdict provoked a riot in the streets of Mold outside, which was put down by soldiers firing indiscriminately into the crowd: four people were killed and dozens more injured.
</p><p>
Leeswood itself was never part of the Flint Boroughs constituency represented by Sir George Wynne, which was one of the bizarre "districts of boroughs" constituencies in Wales and Scotland which grouped together a number of disconnected towns to jointly elect a single MP.  The original five Flint boroughs were Flint itself, Caergwrle, Caerwys, Overton-on-Dee and Rhuddlan; with the exception of Flint, none of these are places which grew to greatness.  The 1832 Reform Act added Holywell and St Asaph to the list.  Meanwhile Connah's Quay (which is actually the largest town in Flintshire) and Mold were never enfranchised as boroughs.
</p><p>
In modern times Leeswood is part of the Clwyd East parliamentary seat, which runs along the spine of the Clwydian hills from Prestatyn to Llangollen.  This was won in 2024 by Labour's Becky Gittins, a trade union negotiator who had resigned her seat on Coventry council in advance of the election (<em>Andrew's Previews 2023</em>, page 499).  She defeated two Conservative MPs, including the disgraced Rob Roberts who had previously represented this area as part of the Delyn constituency; Roberts had lost the Conservative whip in 2021 following a sexual misconduct scandal, and he finished in seventh and last place in Clwyd East as an independent candidate.
</p><p>
The Delyn constituency still exists in the Senedd until May, when electoral reforms will come in.  It has been represented in Cardiff Bay since 2016 by Labour MS Hannah Blythyn, whose firing from the Welsh Cabinet in May 2024 was one of the triggers for the Senedd's no-confidence vote against First Minister Vaughan Gething.  Blythyn is to seek re-election in May at the top of Labour's list for the new Clwyd constituency.  On the votes cast in the 2024 Westminster election Labour would have won 3 seats in the Clwyd constituency against 2 for the Conservatives and one for Reform UK, but if recent Welsh polling is to be believed we could see something very different in a few months' time.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2022/flintshire22s.svgz" alt="Flintshire, 2022" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Very little of this is normally relevant in Flintshire's local elections, which are often closely fought between the Labour Party and independent candidates with other parties rarely getting a look in.  The 2022 election returned 31 Labour councillors, 30 independents, 4 Lib Dems and 2 Conservatives with Labour, who have since picked up one of the Conservative seats in a by-election for Brynford and Halkyn ward (<em>Andrew's Previews 2024</em>, page 150), forming a minority administration.
</p><p>
Previous local elections in Leeswood ward have seen nothing but Labour and independent candidates in this century, with the ward having been represented since 2008 by the late Ray Hughes who was chairman of Flintshire council in 2015-16..  He was originally an independent, but his last re-election in 2022 was with the Labour nomination: on that occasion Hughes polled 61% against 25% for independent candidate Joseph Caruana.  Hughes had previously represented Leeswood on Delyn council from a 1990 by-election until that council's abolition in 1996, being re-elected at the last Delyn elections in 1991 by one vote.  His service on Leeswood and Pontblyddyn community council spanned more than 50 years until his death in October, at the age of 88.
</p><p>
The by-election to replace Hughes will be completely different to what has gone before in this ward, with eight candidates standing - that's more than in the last three local elections here put together.  Ray Thomas is the defending Labour candidate.  Three independent candidates are on the ballot including both of the losing candidates here in 2022: returning candidates Joseph Caruana and Shaun Owen are both sitting Leeswood and Pontblyddyn community councillors, while David Rule is a former member of that community council.  And four parties new to Leeswood's local elections have got in on the act.  Flintshire People's Voice, a Labour splinter group which currently has six members of Flintshire council, have recently registered with the Electoral Commission as a political party and they have nominated Allison Davies as their first official election candidate; Kristian Salkeld is standing for Reform UK, the Lib Dems have nominated Richard Sefton and the Conservative candidate is Oliver Wilson.

<h2>The Rissingtons</h2>
</p><p>
<em>Cotswold council, Gloucestershire; caused by the resignation of Green Party councillor Andrew Maclean.</em>
</p><p>
We now travel from the Clwydian hills of North Wales to the Cotswold hills of Gloucestershire, where we find the Rissingtons.  These are four villages called Great Rissington, Little Rissington, Upper Rissington and Wick Rissington which all lie to the east of the tourist trap of Bourton-on-the-Water and to the south of Stow-on-the-Wold.  Three of these are small picture-postcard villages full of old houses made from warm Cotswold stone.
</p><p>
But in population terms this ward is dominated by Upper Rissington, which is not your typical Cotswolds village at all.  Much of Upper Rissington's housing was originally built by the Ministry of Defence after the Second World War, as officers' and married quarters for RAF Little Rissington.  This airfield is still in operation, with the Air Force using it for ground and elementary flying training, but the associated housing was sold off in the 1990s and then became the nucleus of a new village.  Further housebuilding in recent years means that Upper Rissington now accounts for 72% of this ward's electors.  The Rissingtons ward has the highest proportion of under-16s of any ward in Cotswold district (22.6%), and it makes the top 20 wards in England and Wales for households with exactly two cars (46.3%) - the latter is the highest figure for any ward in the South West region.
</p><p>
So perhaps it shouldn't be too surprising that this ward has been a hotspot for the Green Party in recent years.  The outgoing Green councillor Andrew Maclean narrowly gained the ward from the Conservatives in 2019 and increased his majority to 57-43 at the last Cotswold election in 2023.  Both of those elections were straight fights, with the Liberal Democrats - who have a majority on Cotswold council - standing down in the Greens' favour.  Maclean stood down from Cotswold council in November after being diagnosed with a brain tumour.
</p><p>
The Conservatives do still represent this area at other levels of government.  In fact the local Conservative MP Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown has been <em>in situ</em> here for over 30 years since his first election as MP for Cirencester and Tewkesbury in 1992; several boundary changes later, he was re-elected for his ninth term of office in 2024 as the first MP for the North Cotswolds constituency.  Clifton-Brown now holds the powerful Commons position of chair of the public accounts committee.  The Rissingtons ward is part of the Moreton, Stow and the Rissingtons division of Gloucestershire county council, where the Conservatives narrowly held off the Lib Dems in last year's county elections.
</p><p>
Today's by-election to replace Andrew Maclean will not be a straight fight, with four candidates standing on an all-male ballot paper.  Defending for the Green Party is Bob Eastoe, a retired accountant and Moreton-in-Marsh town councillor who was the Greens' parliamentary candidate for South Cotswolds in 2024; Eastoe stood for the county council in Moreton, Stow and the Rissingtons division last year, finishing in a poor fourth place.  The Conservatives' Alastair Watson is a former Army officer whose CV includes nine years (2003 to 2012) working as private secretary to <s>Prince</s> Andrew.  If you can cope with that, you can cope with anything.  Also joining the fray this time are Reform UK's Matt Fincham and the Lib Dems' Craig Thurling.

<h2>Central Wymondham</h2>
</p><p>
<em>South Norfolk council; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Kevin Hurn.</em>
</p><p>
Our final poll this week is in one of those towns which is a pronunciation trap for the unwary or the non-local.  Wymondham - pronounced WINdm - is a market town lying on the main road and railway line from Norwich to Thetford, around 12 miles to the south-west of Norwich.  Traditionally Wymondham relied on the woollen trade like many Norfolk towns, and some indication of just how important this industry was can be gleaned from the size and splendour of what is left of the mediaeval Wymondham Abbey.
</p><p>
The Abbey was one of the few Wymondham buildings to survive a devastating fire in 1615.  The rebuilding after that fire included a site for a prison, which was described in 1779 by prison reformer John Howard (the namesake of the modern Howard League) as "one of the vilest prisons in England".  The local authorities took note, and in 1785 a new Wymondham Bridewell opened to a revolutionary new design, with men and women kept separate and every prisoner having their own cell.  The Bridewell building remained dedicated to justice, latterly as a courthouse, until the 1990s when it was turned into the Wymondham Heritage Museum.  Justice continues to be a major employer in Wymondham today, as the headquarters of Norfolk Constabulary can be found elsewhere in the town.
</p><p>
Central Wymondham ward is part of the Wymondham division of Norfolk county council, which when it was last contested in 2021 was safe Conservative with the Lib Dems in second place.  The district ward was created in 2019 and it has returned the Conservative slate at both South Norfolk council elections since then.  In 2019 the runner-up spot here went to one Peter Travis of the "Community Candidate Party", which was that party's one and only outing in a UK local election.  The Tories were rather lucky to hold on here in 2023 against a left-wing vote split: shares of the vote were 36% for the Conservative slate, 30% for the Green Party and 29% for Labour.
</p><p>
This result turned out to be crucial in the 2023 South Norfolk council election, which saw the Conservatives hold overall control by the narrowest of margins: they won 24 seats against 11 Lib Dems, 9 Labour and 2 independents.  The Tory council majority then disappeared in May 2024 when they lost a by-election in Bunwell ward to the Green Party (<em>Andrew's Previews 2024</em>, page 233), and the Conservatives cannot rely on the chair's casting vote because the 2025-26 chair of South Norfolk council is a Labour councillor, Deborah Sacks.  A further Conservative loss in this by-election would tip the administration properly into a minority.
</p><p>
Some indication of just how much trouble the South Norfolk Conservatives are in can be seen from the fact that they lost both of the district's parliamentary seats in 2024.  The southern fringes of South Norfolk district are part of the Waveney Valley constituency which is one of the few Green Party seats at Westminster; while Wymondham is the major town in the South Norfolk parliamentary seat which voted Labour in 2024, for the first time since 1945 (when Norfolk had a large and strongly-unionised rural agricultural Labour vote).  The Labour MP for South Norfolk is Ben Goldsworthy, who in another timeline might have appeared earlier in this preview: Goldsworthy is a native East Anglian but his previous elected office was in north Wales as a Flint town councillor, and he had lost to Becky Gittins in the contest for the 2024 Labour nomination in Clwyd East.
</p><p>
The Conservatives will now have to defend this crucial South Norfolk by-election following the sudden and untimely death of Kevin Hurn, who passed away in November at the age of 59.  Hurn had served on South Norfolk council since 2019 and on Wymondham town council since 2015, and he was mayor of Wymondham for four years.
</p><p>
Defending this seat for the Tories is Jonathan Purle, a regulatory consultant who has previous local government experience: Purle served as a Maidstone councillor in Kent from 2018 to 2022, and for his final year he was that council's deputy leader.  More recently Purle won a by-election in this ward last year to be elected to Wymondham town council.  His ward colleagues there include this by-election's Green Party candidate Paul Barrett, and the Labour candidate Lowell Doheny who works as a teacher.  Another all-male ballot is rounded out by Anthony Spears for Reform UK and Stephen Witt for the Lib Dems.
