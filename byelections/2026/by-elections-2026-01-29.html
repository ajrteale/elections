<!-- Andrew's previews continue to be historical and electoral tours de force. - Lord Hayward -->

One by-election on 29th January 2026:
</p><p>
<h2>Bearsden South</h2>
</p><p>
<em>East Dunbartonshire council, Scotland; caused by the disqualification of Conservative councillor Andrew Polson.</em>
</p><p>
Andrew's Previews just has one by-election to bring you today, which is north of the Border in a contender for Scotland's most affluent electoral ward.  We're just beyond Fashionable Maryhill in the northern suburbs of Glasgow, although the residents of Bearsden might well resent me for describing their town like that.
</p><p>
Bearsden lies on the Antonine Wall, a Roman fortification between the Forth and Clyde estuaries which was built in the 2nd century AD but proved not to have staying-power.  The Antonine Wall was the northern boundary of the Roman Empire for only 20 years, and two stretches of its foundations exposed within the New Kilpatrick cemetery is all that can be seen of the wall here today.
</p><p>
There was a Roman fort in Bearsden, which was constructed along with the wall and whose site has now been built over.  It lay either side of Roman Road, a modern thoroughfare which runs east from the Bearsden Cross road junction and which still follows the route of the principal road through the fort.  This is the only Antonine Wall fort to have been thoroughly investigated by archaeologists since the Second World War, as the housing on the site was redeveloped in the 1970s which provided an opportunity for excavation.  The foundations of the fort's bathhouse and latrine block were exposed at this time, and they are now on public display to the north of Roman Road - and thus just outside the boundary of this ward.
</p><p>
The Ordnance Survey's 1969 map of the Antonine Wall refers to this fort as "New Kilpatrick", which was a common name for this general area well into the 20th century.  The original New Kilpatrick parish covered a large area, much of which has been annexed by Glasgow over the years; but Bearsden has always been run independently of the big city.  New Kilpatrick parish was split between Dunbartonshire and Stirlingshire until all of it became part of Dunbartonshire in 1889, and much of the eastern part of the modern Bearsden South ward - including the cemetery and the Asda supermarket - remained part of the Stirlingshire parliamentary constituency until 1918.
</p><p>
It was only when Bearsden was promoted into a burgh in 1958 that the name New Kilpatrick started to fall out of favour.  The "Bearsden" name - which probably doesn't mean what it says - seems to originate with the North British Railway, which opened a line from Glasgow to Milngavie in 1863 and included a station here in what was then a very rural area.  The railway company didn't want to call their station New Kilpatrick because they already had a station some distance away at Old Kilpatrick, and they were worried about the potential for confusion.  Instead the station became "Bearsden", a name which the railway apparently took from a nearby house.  The modern town then took its name from the railway station.
</p><p>
Whatever the etymology, Bearsden quickly developed into a classic middle-class railway commuter suburb with high-status detached housing, and it retains that status today.  Bearsden and Hillfoot stations have half-hourly trains to the city centre, while the ward boundary also includes the junction station at Westerton which has a rather more frequent service.
</p><p>
Politically, this extremely affluent corner of the Central Belt has rather unusual voting patterns.  It last went to the polls in 2024 as part of the Mid Dunbartonshire constituency, which had been renamed from the previous "East Dunbartonshire" for no particularly good reason.  The old East Dunbartonshire seat had voted for all four of the Scottish Westminster parties at some point since the Second World War, with its final contest in 2019 seeing the Liberal Democrats' party leader Jo Swinson lose her seat to the Scottish National Party by 149 votes on a turnout of over 80%.  The Lib Dems got their revenge in the redrawn Mid Dunbartonshire in 2024, with an easy gain for their new candidate Susan Murray; she is now on the Lib Dems' Westminster frontbench, shadowing the Scotland portfolio.
</p><p>
The Scottish Parliament boundaries in this area are much less helpfully drawn from the Lib Dems' point of view.  Bearsden South ward is part of the Strathkelvin and Bearsden Holyrood constituency, whose name is rather bizarre as it does not include Bearsden North ward (which is in the Clydebank and Milngavie seat).  Strathkelvin and Bearsden has followed the usual Central Belt pattern of voting Labour in Scottish Parliament elections until 2011 and SNP since then, but this was interrupted in 2003 when the seat voted for independent candidate Jean Turner, a retired GP standing on a campaign of saving services at Stobhill Hospital in Springburn.  The SNP MSP here since 2016 has been Rona Mackay, who is to retire at the next Holyrood election in just over three months' time.

</p><p>
The SNP carried six of East Dunbartonshire's seven wards at the most recent Scottish local elections in 2022 and they run the council as a minority, but this masks a complicated pattern at local level.  The first-preference vote across the council area was 30% for the SNP, 19% for Labour, 18% for the Conservatives and 16% for the Lib Dems, but once the vote transfers were taken into account the SNP won 8 seats to 6 for the Lib Dems, 4 Labour, 3 Conservatives and an independent.  The Lib Dems' Susan Murray resigned from the council after her election to Westminster, and the resulting by-election last year in (lovers of the Oxford comma please look away now) Kirkintilloch East and North and Twechar ward was gained by Labour.
</p><p>
The modern Bearsden South ward was created in 2007 and it has very fragmented voting patterns, with the party in first place normally earning well under 30% of the vote.  This isn't a problem for a PR system, as is used in Scottish local government.  Of the ward's three seats, one has been held continuously since 2007 by Lib Dem councillor Vaughan Moody; and one has been held continuously since 2007 by the SNP, whose councillor is currently Neil Gallagher.  The other seat went to the Conservatives in 2007, to the Lib Dems in a December 2009 by-election and to Labour in 2012, before being won in 2017 by the Conservatives' Andrew Polson.
</p><p>
Andrew Polson was the Conservative candidate for Strathkelvin and Bearsden in the 2016 and 2021 Holyrood elections, finishing second to the SNP on those occasions, and he served as co-leader of East Dunbartonshire council from 2018 to 2022.  At the same time, Polson was engaged in other activities that would eventually get him into the Councillors Behaving Badly file.  Outside politics he was the financial director and chief operating officer of Revival FM, a radio station based in Cumbernauld which broadcast Christian music and content.  He had also been in a relationship with Ann Kelly, a church organist who also worked at the radio station.  In 2018 Polson married someone else, but he and Kelly got back together during the pandemic.
</p><p>
In May 2021 Polson persuaded Kelly to pay him £40,500 from her divorce settlement to buy out his ex-wife's share of a house in Lanarkshire, with Kelly believing that she would jointly own half of the property and that she would receive half of any rental income.  In January 2022 Kelly paid Polson a further £146,000 to buy a house in Bearsden which she had understood would be in her sole name, and she was also paying £200 per month to a company called AA Lettings which they had set up to pay for repair costs on the two properties.  This went on until March 2022, when Kelly saw AA Lettings' accounts.
</p><p>
In fact Polson had registered both of the properties in his sole name, and he was using the income from AA Lettings to fund his social life.  And as well as defrauding his partner to the tune of £186,000 he was also embezzling a total of £9,018 from Revival FM, with a new kitchen for the Bearsden property and a £2,500 trip to a Glasgow casino charged to Revival FM's bank card.  This loss eventually resulted in the radio station going under.
</p><p>
Once the police got involved Andrew Polson was suspended from the Conservatives in June 2022, shortly after he had been re-elected for his second term.  The police investigation into Polson then dragged in his estranged wife Aileen, who is also an East Dunbartonshire councillor, as both of them were arrested in October 2022 and charged with electoral fraud over allegations that they had been living in Glasgow at the time of the 2022 election.  This led to Aileen Polson being suspended from her party, the Liberal Democrats, although they have since let her back in and it's not clear what has happened to those charges.
</p><p>
In October 2025 a jury at Glasgow Sheriff Court found Andrew Polson guilty of fraud and embezzlement, and in November Sheriff Reid sentenced him to 22 months in prison.  He is also banned from contacting Kelly for 3 years and has been disqualified from being a company director for 5 years.  The prison sentence also disqualifies Andrew Polson as a councillor.
</p><p>
This triggers a by-election in, as stated, a ward with very fragmented politics.  At the 2022 election in Bearsden South the SNP, the Conservatives and the Lib Dems all polled 23% of the first-preference vote and won one seat each, with Labour finishing as runner-up on 16%.  If the count had been for a single seat then Polson would have been eliminated in third place, and his transfers would have gone strongly to the Lib Dems' Vaughan Moody for a wide final margin of 62-38 over the SNP.
</p><p>
So this is a difficult defence for the Conservatives' Duncan Evans, who stood in 2022 in Bearsden North ward and finished as runner-up after losing out to the Lib Dems on transfers.  The Lib Dem candidate is Scout leader Ben Langmead, who has also been selected by the party to stand in May's Holyrood elections in Clydebank and Milngavie.  The SNP have selected Lynne Gibbons, who gives an address in Milngavie ward.  Labour's Lorna Dougall is back for anther go after finishing as runner-up here in 2022; Dougall was also the Labour candidate for Mid Dunbartonshire in the 2024 Westminster election, finishing in third place.  Emma Sheppard for the Greens, John Fairlie for Reform UK and Liam McKechnie for the Scottish Family Party complete a ballot paper of seven candidates.  This is a Scottish local by-election so please rank the candidates on your ballot paper in order of preference - because those transfers could be crucial.
