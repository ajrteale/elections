<!-- Andrew's previews continue to be historical and electoral tours de force. - Lord Hayward -->
<blockquote>
"All the right votes, but not necessarily in the right order"
</blockquote>
</p><p>
Three polls on 5th February 2026:
</p><p>
<h2>Coleman Street</h2>
</p><p>
<em>City of London Court of Aldermen; caused by the resignation of Alderman Sir Peter Estlin.</em>
</p><p>
We're going to start this week with a poll to possibly the quaintest of the UK's Quaint Democratic Traditions.  You might have thought that the House of Commons was ancient and antiquated, but it is not in fact the UK's oldest elected institution.
</p><p>
That accolade belongs the City of London Corporation, which has been running local government in the Square Mile since - well, nobody really knows how long but certainly since time immemorial.  The first Lord Mayor of London, Henry fitz Ailwin, served in that office from 1189 until his death in 1212; and even before that he had been involved in London's governance as an Alderman of the city.  Since 1200 London has had 25 Aldermen, one for each of the City's ancient wards; this Court of Aldermen was quickly supplemented by the larger Court of Common Council, which currently has 100 members.
</p><p>
One of the few surviving clauses of Magna Carta still in force provides that "the City of London shall have all the old Liberties and Customs which it hath been used to have".  Partly because of this, and partly because the City's system of local governance has always had an unusually wide franchise, the City Corporation has escaped unscathed every local government reorganisation which has taken place over the last two centuries.
</p><p>
This means that many of the old mediaeval traditions still survive, including the concept of the wardmote - a public meeting which is hardwired into the City's electoral process.  The wardmote takes place on the day before polling and in modern times it functions as a hustings for the election: the meeting is then adjourned for the poll to take place, and it will be reconvened tonight for the declaration of the result.  City election rules require all of this action to take place within the ward boundary, and the chosen venue for this election is the 19th-century Armourers' Hall on the corner of London Wall and Coleman Street.
</p><p>
Which brings us to Coleman Street ward, which runs north from Gresham Street near the Bank to the northern boundary of the City.  Coleman Street - which takes its name from mediaeval charcoal-burners who were located here - would once have been a major artery, but it has been superseded by the busy modern thoroughfare of Moorgate.
</p><p>
The original Moorgate was a minor gate in the Roman Wall which surrounded the City, taking its name from the open space of Moorfields to the north.  The Moorfields was a marshy area, partly because this is where the Wall obstructed the Walbrook river which once flowed through the City from north to south.  The Walbrook's course is marked by the modern Blomfield Street which is Coleman Street ward's eastern boundary, and which hides a macabre secret.  In 1838 workmen building a sewer along Blomfield Street discovered hundreds of human skulls on the old course of the Walbrook, which appear to date from the Roman period; further ancient skeletons have turned up here in later excavations.
</p><p>
The modern equivalent of the Moorfields is Finsbury Circus, the largest public green space in the City.  Nonetheless the builders were here for much of the 21st century so far, as part of construction work for the Elizabeth Line whose Liverpool Street station lies under the Circus.
</p><p>
The Crossrail station also links up to Moorgate underground station, where the east-west Metropolitan and Circle lines cross the north-south City branch of the Northern Line.  This is also a mainline London Terminal, with suburban trains running north from here through old Underground tunnels towards Finsbury Park and beyond.
</p><p>
Back in their Underground days, the mainline platforms at Moorgate station were the scene of the Tube's worst peacetime accident on 28th February 1975, when an approaching train crashed at full speed into the end of the tunnel killing the driver - whose failure to apply the brake has never been satisfactorily explained - and 42 passengers.  As a result of this tragedy, a safety system called Moorgate control was installed at all London Underground terminal platforms to prevent this happening again.  The railway line from Moorgate to Finsbury Park has recently been converted to use digital signalling, providing a further margin of safety.
</p><p>
The City of London is known for its tall buildings and Coleman Street is no exception to this.  Opposite the Armourers' Hall is Moor House, a building of sexily-curved steel and glass which dwarfs a new statue of the poet John Keats in the plaza outside.  Keats was born in a pub a few yards away which is now called the Globe and is attached to Moorgate station.
Not far to the north is Citypoint, a 35-storey skyscraper which opened in 1967 as the corporate headquarters of BP; it was the first building in the Square Mile to exceed the height of St Paul's Cathedral, but it's now only the 13th-highest building in the City.  Round the corner from there is a curious salient of this ward along Silk Street and Chiswell Street, opposite the Barbican theatre and concert hall.  Last time I was in London I ate before a Barbican concert at the Jugged Hare, which lies at the north-west corner of this ward.
</p><p>
The reason for this curious salient appears to be to ensure that the boundaries of Coleman Street ward do not include the Heron, a 35-storey skyscraper on the corner of Silk Street and Moor Lane which is partly used by the Guildhall School of Music and Drama but mostly given over to residential apartments.  Having the Heron here would disturb the nature of Coleman Street ward as a ward dominated by business.
</p><p>
I mentioned earlier that the City Corporation has always had an unusually wide franchise, and that remains the case today.  Within the Square Mile, the right to vote is vested not just in people who live in the City but also in people who work here: sole traders get votes as of right, while businesses based here can nominate a number of their employees as electors on a sliding scale depending on their headcount.  The Magic Circle law firm Linklaters, whose head office is on Silk Street opposite the Barbican, gets to nominate 48 electors for this poll; Deutsche Bank, who occupy a large and very new office building at 21 Moorfields which was named as The City Building of the Year 2025, can register 70 of its employees to vote.  By contrast, the number of <em>residential</em> electors in Coleman Street ward is, it appears, one.  This election is very much not a case of one man, one vote.
</p><p>
The Court of Common Council elects all of its 100 Common Councilmen at once for four-year terms, with the most recent election taking place in March 2025.  Coleman Street has four Common Councilmen, who are currently Shahnan Bakth, Philip Kelvin, Sushil Saluja and Dawn Wright; all of them were elected last year without a contest as independent candidates, because City elections are normally run on a non-partisan basis.  In recent years Labour have normally stood a few official candidates in the wards covering the Barbican estate where most of the City's residents live, but essentially the Common Council and the Court of Aldermen have an independent majority which will continue for the foreseeable future.
</p><p>
The Alderman of the City are technically elected for life, but in practice they are expected to seek re-election every six years and to retire at 70 - although this may have recently been extended to 75, to match changes in the judicial retirement age.  As a result of this, Aldermanic elections are not synchronised and happen as and when necessary on a roughly six-year cycle.  However, this cycle was disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic which prevented Aldermanic elections being held in 2020 or 2021, so we are not likely to see many such polls over the next two years.
</p><p>
The outgoing Alderman for Coleman Street ward is Sir Peter Estlin, a chartered accountant who rose through the traditional City industries of banking and finance: he is currently the chairman of Vanquis Bank and he has previously worked as acting chief financial officer at Barclays.  Estlin was first elected as an Alderman in 2013 and he served in 2018-19 as the 691st Lord Mayor of London; once that mayoral term was over he sought re-election as an Alderman in December 2019 and nobody opposed his bid for a second term.  I speculated in this column at the time that Estlin could "expect the customary honour in the New Year" (<em>Andrew's Previews 2019</em>, page 405), and his knighthood was duly forthcoming in the 2020 New Year honours list for services to international business, to inclusion and to skills.  Estlin is now in his mid-60s, and he is standing down at the end of his second term of office.
</p><p>
Open seats in the Court of Aldermen don't come up very often, and there is a lot of interest in this vacancy with eight candidates standing.  Two of them are sitting Common Councilmen for this ward: Dawn Wright, who is currently the ward's deputy alderman, won a by-election to the Common Council in July 2019 (<em>Andrew's Previews 2019</em>, page 225) and is associated with the Worshipful Company of Information Technologists, while Sushil Saluja is a former senior partner with Accenture who has served the ward since March last year.  Both of them tried and failed and to become Aldermen in different wards in 2023: Wright contested Langbourn ward that year and finished in joint last place out of nine candidates with just five votes, while Saluja finished a strong second in Castle Baynard ward.  Rumour has it that the City Establishment candidate is Linda Yueh, who is notable enough for Wikipedia: Yueh, who came to London from her native Taiwan via the USA, is an economist and broadcaster who was appointed CBE in the 2023 New Year Honours for services to economics, and she has recently been appointed by the government to a four-year term as chair of the Royal Parks.  Top of the ballot paper is Charles Hall, who commutes into London from northern Buckinghamshire and works for the investment bank Peel Hunt; John May is a past master of the Paviors Company and is the only candidate to give an address within the City; David Stringer-Lamarre is a past master of the Glaziers Company and runs a consulting firm and a menopause clinic; Richard Thomas gives an address in an upmarket part of Westminster; and Jat Wasu is associated with the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, which is based on this ward.  As usual in City elections, all of these candidates are independents.  Polls are open in this election from 8am to 8pm after which, as stated, the Wardmote will resume at the Armourers' Hall for the declaration of the result.

<h2>Clevedon South</h2>
</p><p>
<em>North Somerset council; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Hannah Young.</em>
</p><p>
This February is shaping up to be a relatively quiet month for partisan by-elections, with just ten such polls in the diary over the next four weeks - although that includes the parliamentary by-election in Gorton and Denton, which will get the usual special treatment in due course.  Before then we have two local by-elections to bring you today, one in England and the other in Wales.
</p><p>
For today's English by-election we are in the Victorian seaside resort of Clevedon, which lies on the Somerset coast a few miles to the north of Weston-super-Mare.  Clevedon is divided into five electoral wards of which South is the most compact: this is a residential area in the south-east corner of the town, next to the M5 motorway junction and well away from the seafront.  The motorway gives easy access from this ward to Weston to the south, and Bristol to the north.
</p><p>
Clevedon is one of the main towns in the North Somerset parliamentary seat, which lies between Bristol and Weston-super-Mare.  This seat was a Labour gain in the 2024 general election, when Sadik al-Hassan defeated the long-serving Conservative MP and former Cabinet minister Sir Liam Fox.  Al-Hassan had been a pharmacist before his election to the Commons, so perhaps it's appropriate that he lives within his constituency in the village of Pill.
</p><p>
North Somerset council, which includes Weston, has been hung since 2019 and the 2023 election returned a very balanced council of 13 Conservatives, 10 Labour councillors, 9 Lib Dems, 8 independents, 7 Greens and 3 Portishead Independents.  A rainbow coalition of everybody except the Conservatives and two associated independent councillors was formed to run the show, with the Lib Dems supplying the council leader.  There have been two by-elections since May 2023, with the Green Party gaining Wrington ward from an independent later that year (<em>Andrew's Previews 2023</em>, page 542) and then successfully defending a seat in Long Ashton ward last November.
</p><p>
Clevedon South ward has not shown much political stability in this century, with the six North Somerset council elections here from 2003 returning six different councillors.  The present ward boundaries date from 2015 when the ward returned Conservative Robert Garner, who was heavily defeated in 2019 by independent candidate Mark Crosby.  Crosby didn't seek re-election in 2023, at which point Clevedon South voted Labour for the first time since 2003: Hannah Young defeated the Conservatives' Harry Blades by 54-46 in a straight fight.  Young, who had been the Labour candidate for the North Somerset constituency at the 2019 general election, quickly joined the North Somerset council cabinet with the highways and transport portfolio.
</p><p>
Hannah Young stepped down from the council in December as she was moving away from the district for family caring reasons.  Defending the resulting Clevedon South by-election for Labour is Michael Harriott, who is a Clevedon town councillor.  The Conservatives have reselected their defeated candidate from 2023 Harry Blades, who works in accounting and finance.  This time there will not be a straight fight, as Louise Brandon of Reform UK, Jude Chambers of the Lib Dems and Dave Skinner of the Green Party have thrown their hats into the ring.

<h2>Ynys Gybi</h2>
</p><p>
<em>Isle of Anglesey council, North Wales; caused by the death of Plaid Cymru councillor Trefor Hughes.</em>
</p><p>
For our final poll today we are going offshore to Holy Island, an island off the west coast of Anglesey which gets a lot of passing traffic.  Here we find the port of Holyhead, from where ferries to and from Dublin arrive and depart several times a day.  Holyhead is Anglesey's largest town and it is entirely dependent on the ferry port, which is the reason for its good transport links.  Thomas Telford's Holyhead Road (now the A5), its modern successor the A55 North Wales Expressway, and the North Wales Coast railway line all terminate at the ferry port.
</p><p>
The main roads and the railway all access Holyhead from the east via the Stanley Embankment, a causeway which was built by Telford in 1823 across the shallow Cymyran Strait which separates Holy Island from Anglesey proper.  This embankment superseded the old Four Mile Bridge, so called because it is located four miles from Holyhead, which crosses the strait at its narrowest point and has been here since at least the 16th century.  The original road to Holyhead then proceeds through the small seaside resort of Trearddur Bay to reach the town.
</p><p>
Treaddur is close to the centre of Holy Island, with the small village of Rhoscolyn lying to the south.  Much of the west of the island is taken up by Holyhead Mountain, a peak of 222 metres which is the highest point in Anglesey; <a href="https://www.viewfinderpanoramas.org/panoramas/WAL/HOLYHEAD_MOUNTAIN.png">it has a very extensive view across the Irish Sea</a>, with the Wicklow Mountains, the Mountains of Mourne, the Isle of Man and even the Lake District (100 miles away) visible from the top on the clearest of days.  The top of Holyhead Mountain also has extensive prehistoric remains of an Iron Age hillfort and a Roman watchtower, while just off its western edge is the island and lighthouse of South Stack which is connected to the mainland by a suspension footbridge.
</p><p>
Holy Island gets its English name from the number of religious sites here, which range from standing stones to St Gwenfaen's Well.  In the Welsh language the island is associated with St Cybi, a sixth-century figure from a noble Cornish family who went on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, came back to Cornwall to find that his father was dead and he was now king, and turned down the throne to travel preaching the Gospels.  In due course Cybi's travels brought him to Holyhead, where he founded a monastery within an abandoned Roman fort.  The fort (Caergybi) and the island (Ynys Gybi) then took Cybi's name.
</p><p>
The modern Ynys Gybi ward covers the southern fringes of Holyhead together with the more rural Trearddur and Rhoscolyn communities.  It was created for the 2013 Anglesey council elections which had been delayed by a year - not because of local government reorganisation, but because Anglesey council had become a dysfunctional mess at the time and the Welsh Government needed to find some way of rebuilding it.  The solution was a radical new electoral map which swept away the island's many single-member wards that provided a powerbase for local independent councillors.  Here, the previous wards of Kingsland, Maeshyfryd and Trearddur were merged to create Ynys Gybi ward, with three councillors.
</p><p>
At its first election in 2013 Ynys Gybi ward returned Trefor Hughes for Plaid Cymru and two independent councillors, Dafydd Thomas and Jeffrey Evans.  Evans lost his seat in 2017 to Labour's Keith Roberts, and all three ward councillors were re-elected in 2022 to preserve the three-way Plaid/Independent/Labour split.  Shares of the vote, for what it's worth given that only the Conservatives ran a full slate of candidates, were 29% for Plaid Cymru, 26% for Thomas and 24% for Labour, with the Conservative slate missing out on 21%.  Plaid Cymru have an overall majority on Anglesey council, with the 2022 elections returning 21 Plaid councillors, 10 independents, 3 Labour and 1 Lib Dem.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2022/anglesey22s.svgz" alt="Isle of Anglesey, 2022" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Anglesey as a whole has been a single Westminster constituency since 1918 and it was exempted from the 2024 boundary review.  In 2024 the Ynys Môn seat turfed out its sitting MP for the first time since 1951, as the Plaid council leader Llinos Medi defeated the Conservatives' Virginia Crosbie.  Medi subsequently resigned her council seat, and the resulting October 2024 by-election in Talybolion ward was lost to an independent candidate (<em>Andrew's Previews 2024</em>, page 548).
</p><p>
In the Senedd, Ynys Môn is represented by Plaid Cymru's party leader Rhun ap Iorwerth, who has represented the seat since a 2013 by-election.  May's Senedd electoral reform will create a cross-Menai seat called Bangor Conwy Môn, which will elect six MSs - a rather generous allocation given that the new Senedd constituencies have been constructed by pairing off Westminster constituencies, and Anglesey's electorate is significantly lower than every other Welsh Westminster constituency.  On the votes cast in the 2024 Westminster election in Bangor Aberconwy and Ynys Môn, Labour, Plaid Cymru and the Conservatives would have won two seats each.
</p><p>
Before then Plaid Cymru have to defend this by-election to replace long-serving Anglesey councillor Trefor Lloyd Hughes, who died in November at the age of 77.  Hughes was first elected to the modern Anglesey council on its establishment in 1995, lost his seat to Labour in 2004 but got it back 2008.  He was originally elected for Maeshyfryd ward in southern Holyhead before transferring here in 2013, and he had also had a year as mayor of Holyhead.  But it was in football administration that Hughes made his mark, and a series of league secretary roles culminated in August 2012 with his election as president of the Football Association of Wales.  He held that role for seven years before standing down on health grounds.  In 2007 Hughes became a member of the Gorsedd of the Bards, and in the 2017 New Year Honours list he was appointed MBE for services to football in Wales, particularly Anglesey.
</p><p>
Defending this seat for Plaid Cymru is Bethan Pari Jones, who runs a microbrewery in Holyhead - Bragdy Cybi.  There is one independent on the ballot paper, Robert Williams, who runs a health and safety training firm.  Labour have selected Mary Roberts, who was previously their Westminster candidate for Ynys Môn in 2019.  The Conservative candidate (Margaret) Fredericka John is standing in her first election campaign.  And two parties which didn't stand here in 2022 have joined the fray: Nick Bounds stands for the Green Party, and Celfyn Furlong - who was a Conservative candidate in the last two Anglesey local elections - has the Reform UK nomination.
