Two by-elections on 15th January 2026:

<h2>Bridgemary</h2>

<em>Gosport council, Hampshire; caused by the death of Liberal Democrat councillor Bob Maynard.</em>

Welcome to 2026 which will be the 17th year of Andrew's Previews, the weekly column which has been going in some form or other since 2010 and takes an unusual look at the UK's politics.  Rather than basing ourselves in Westminster and looking at what the national politicians are doing, we view Britain at a local level from the other end of the municipal drainpipe.  Every week Andrew's Previews take an in-depth look at a few of the 10,000 or so electoral wards which cover the UK and are used to elect our local councillors: and each week's selection is driven by the local by-elections which take place up and down the country nearly every week of the year.

January is not a popular time for local by-elections, and the reason why should be obvious to anyone who has looked out of the window and seen what the weather is doing at this time of year.  Pounding the streets on the long, cold, dark and wet winter evenings is not an attractive prospect.  But there's a lot at stake in our first two polls of 2026, both of which have council majorities on the line.

We'll start the year on the Solent, whose towns and cities have all grown into each other to form a single conurbation: there is no green space to separate Portsmouth from Havant, Portsmouth from Fareham or Fareham from Gosport.  The gap between Fareham and Gosport has effectively been filled in by the development of Bridgemary, a postwar council estate which lies off the main road in and out of Gosport at the north-west corner of Portsmouth Harbour.  The Harbour shoreline here is in industrial and military use: here we find the misleadingly-named Fareham Business Park (it is not in Fareham), the Fleetlands heliport and a large chunk of the Defence Munitions Gosport site where the MoD stores armaments for ships at the Portsmouth naval base over the water.  On the wetern side of the main road is Bridgemary's population, which is mostly working-class and at the wrong end of the deprivation indices: a quarter of the ward's housing is socially-rented.

In most areas of the country this would point to a Labour political history, but Gosport's reliance on the defence industry has always tilted its politics a long way to the right of what would be expected.  Gosport has been a parliamentary seat of its own since 1974 and it has only had two Conservative MPs in that time.  Dame Caroline Dinenage, who took over from Sir Peter "duck house" Viggers in 2010, was re-elected very easily amid the carnage of 2024 and now chairs the Commons culture, media and sport committee.  Dinenage has military connections herself, through her husband Mark Lancaster who is a long-serving Army Reserve officer and currently holds the rank of major-general; Lancaster was also a Conservative MP for Milton Keynes from 2005 to 2019, and he now sits in the Lords as Lord Lancaster of Kimbolton.

We also see Conservative dominance across the town in the 2021 Hampshire county council elections, in which Gosport returned four Conservatives and one Lib Dem.  The Conservative tally included Bridgemary county division, which is much larger than this ward.

However, the Conservatives lost control of Gosport council in 2022 to the Liberal Democrats.  Gosport is one of the few English councils which re-elects half of its membership every two years, and at the May 2024 elections the Conservatives did make a gain here against the national trend: that left a bare Lib Dem majority of 15 seats against 11 Conservatives and two Labour councillors.  Labour gained Grange and Alver Valley ward from the Conservatives in a July 2024 by-election (<em>Andrew's Previews 2024</em>, page 352), but then fell back to two seats after the Conservatives gained Harbourside and Town ward later that year (<em>Andrew's Previews 2024</em>, page 642).  A Lib Dem loss in today's Bridgemary by-election would leave the party with half of the 28 seats, and they would then be reliant on the casting vote of the mayor Kirsten Bradley.

Until 2022 there were two Bridgemary wards, both of which were normally fought in this century between the Conservatives and Labour - often as straight fights.  Bridgemary North was one of Gosport's few wards which normally voted Labour in council elections, whereas Bridgemary South was more Cosnervative-inclined.  The Lib Dems didn't even stand in this area until a November 2017 by-election in Bridgemary North ward - which they won, gaining the ward from Labour (<em>Andrew's Previews 2017</em>, page 363).  A second seat in that ward followed in May 2018, at which point the Lib Dems also started to contest the more Conservative-inclined Bridgemary South ward.  By the time the 2022 boundary changes created the modern Bridgemary ward, the Labour vote in this working-class corner of Hampshire had faded away: the Lib Dem slate won Bridgemary ward by 58-32 over the Conseratives in 2022, falling to 48-38 in 2024.

The late Lib Dem councillor Bob Maynard had been first elected in the 2022 all-out elections, and he was re-elected for a full four-year term in 2024.  Before retiring and entering politics Maynard had had a long career as a gas engineer, starting as a 16-year-old apprentice with British Gas.  His death in late November prompted an outbreak of political discord, as Reform UK - who clearly fancy their chances here - put in the official request for this by-election within hours of Maynard's death being announced in a move which was seen by the late councillor's family as disrepectful.

Defending this seat for the Liberal Democrats is Stephen Marshall, who is seeking to return to Gosport council: he was elected in 2022 as a councillor for Brockhurst and Privett ward in the west of the town, but then didn't seek re-election in 2024.  Another former Gosport councillor seeking to return is the Conservatives' Kath Jones, who represented the former Bridgemary South ward from 2016 to 2022; Jones lost re-election here in 2022 following boundary changes and unsuccessfully tried to get her seat back in 2024.  Also on the ballot are Labour's Claire Percival and Reform UK's Paul Carter, who is described as a businessman and entrepreneur.

<h2>Heworth</h2>

<em>York council, North Yorkshire; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Ben Burton.</em>

Our second by-election of the week comes in the city of York.  You don't have to go far north-east from the ancient city walls to reach Heworth Green, which is on an old Roman line and is now part of the main road out of the city towards Scarborough.  It was somewhere around here that a skirmish took place in August 1453 which is sometimes cited as the first action in the Wars of the Roses: the Battle of Heworth Moor was between the forces of the Percy family and the Neville family, with the Percys seeking to ambush the Nevilles as they returned home from a wedding.

The area of the modern Heworth ward was incorporated into York in 1884, but this boundary expansion didn't take in the whole of Heworth parish: this resulted in a new parish of Heworth Without being created, and that area remained outside the York city boundary until 1996 even though it was clearly part of York's urban area.  The division between Heworth and Heworth Without is still important for parliamentary purposes, with Heworth ward being part of the safe Labour seat of York Central.  This has been represented since 2015 by Rachel Maskell, who lost the Labour whip for a time last year after voting against welfare retorms but is now back in the fold.

In the 2021 census Heworth ward had Yorkshire's highest rate of residents in part-time employment (17.7%) and made the top 30 wards across England and Wales for that statistic.  The ward has a significant student population and large amounts of social housing, particularly in the Tang Hall area which is split between this ward and Hull Road ward.  The deprived Bell Farm area at the northern end of the ward lies next to the massive Nestlé factory, formerly Rowntree's, which is a major local employer.

Like the KitKats which come out Nestlé's factory at the rate of 6 million a day, Heworth's local politics is wrapped in red.  The ward has consistently returned the Labour slate to Hull council in this century, and at the most recent York local elections in 2023 elections Labour had a big lead of 64-15 over the Green Party here.  Before 2023 York had a hung council run by a Lib Dem-Green coalition, which had lost popular support by banning blue-badge disabled parking in the city centre on anti-terror grounds: the Labour party won a majority on York council with a pledge to reverse that ban.  It was a narrow win, with Labour securing 24 seats against 19 Lib Dems, 3 Conservatives and an independent for an overall majority of 1; the previous Green Party group was wiped out, which is not something you see very often in UK local electios.

The Labour majority on York council is now up for grabs as a result of the resignation of Heworth ward councillor Ben Burton, who was first elected in 2023.  He is moving awy from the city for work reasons.

Defending this seat for Labour is Anna Perrett, who previously represeted Heworth ward from 2019 to 2023 when she didn't seek re-election.  Perrett was also the Labour parliamentary candidate for York Outer at the 2019 general election.  The Green Party's Ben Ffrench, a support worker, is contesting his second York by-election of this term after standing in the neighbouring Hull Road ward in July 2024; in a controversial move Ffrench lists his favourite biscuit on the excellent website <a href="https://whocanivotefor.co.uk">whocanivotefor.co.uk</a> as "chocolate hobnobs".  Which are of course McVitie's, not Nestlé's.  Also standing are Emma Dolben for the Conservatives, Ian Eiloart for the Liberal Democrats, John Crispin-Bailey for Reform UK and Heworth Without parish councillor Emma Hardy as an independent candidate.

Next week's column will be split into two parts, because two wards in Derbyshire will be going to the polls on Tuesday: their Preview will be out on Monday for paid subscribers and on Tuesday for everyone else.  Stay tuned.
