Two by-elections on Tuesday 20th January 2026:

<h2>Horsley</h2>

Derbyshire county coucil; caused by the resignation of Reform UK councillor Richard Morgan; and

<h2>Codnor, Langley Mill and Aldercar</h2>

Amber Valley council, Derbyshire; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor David Moon.

Yes, it's Tuesday - so why not have a by-election?  By-elections don't have to be held on Thursdays as is traditional; any working day will do, and sometimes it happens that another day of the week is more convenient.  Amber Valley have a full council meeting scheduled for Wednesday evening this week, so it makes sense to held their poll before then so that the winner of today's by-election to that council can start work straight away.  And once the Amber Valley by-election was pencilled in for Tuesday 20th January, it made sense to schedule today's Derbyshire county council by-election - which the Amber Valley returning officer is also responsible for - on the same day, which allows economies of scale to be made and reduces the risk of confusion.

The Amber Valley ward and Derbyshire county council electoral areas which poll today don't overlap, but they do border each other and together they completely surround the town of Heanor.  The Codnor, Langley Mill and Aldercar ward covers two parishes to the north and east of Heanor.  Aldercar and Langley Mill are a pair of villages in the Erewash valley, between Heanor to the west and Eastwood to the east, which have fused together into a single urban area and civil parish.  Aldercar is perhaps best known in the local area for its secondary school, while Langley Mill is the local railhead: there are hourly trains from here to Nottingham.  Both villages are bypased by the A610 road between Nottingham and Matlock, but no bypass has built for the village of Codnor to the north.

The more rural Horsley division of Derbyshire county council takes in seven parishes to the south and west of Heanor.  Horsley itself is quite a small place and the largest single centre of population here is Kilburn, which lies on the road between Heanor and Belper.  Not far behind is Smalley parish, whose population has been boosted in recent years by overspill development from Heanor.  The nearby parish of Denby is best known as the birthplace of John Flamsteed, the first Astronomer Royal, and for the Denby Pottery Company which has been firing pottery products here for over two centuries.  Meanwhile, Shipley Country Park to the south of Heanor is a local beauty spot, described by the county council as offering "700 acres of attractive and varied landscape".

All this lies within the Amber Valley parliamentary seat, a key marginal which since its creation in 1983 has changed hands whenever the government changes.  It was a Labour gain in 2024 for Linsey Farnsworth, a solicitor who had a previous local government base in this area.  Farnsworth was elected to Amber Valley council in 2023 as the Labour councillor for Kilburn, Denby, Holbrook and Horsley ward which is mostly part of the Horsley county division.  In 2024 she defeated the Conservative MP Nigel Mills, who had similarly been an Amber Valley council for this area before his election to Parliament in 2010: he then represented Shipley Park, Horsley and Horsley Woodhouse ward.

The 2021 census was taken on an earlier ward map for Amber Valley, in which Langley Mill and Aldercar ward had the highest number of residents professing no religion of any ward in the East Midlands, at 58.95%; this made the top 60 wards for that statistic in England and Wales.  The Langley Mill and Codnor area is generally more working-class than the wards which make up the Horsley county division, and this was reflected in Amber Valley council results on the old ward map.  The predcessor wards to Codnor, Langley Mill and Aldercar normally voted Labour although the Conservatives were capable of winning here in landslide conditions; while the wards covering the Horsley county division continuously returned Conservative councillors from 2003 to 2021.

But the ruling Conservative group in Amber Valley suffered a damaging split ahead of all-out council elections in 2023, with several of their councillors walking off to join Reform UK.  One of those defectors was Alex Stevenson, who was then the county councillor for Greater Heanor and a long-serving Amber Valley councillor for Shipley Park, Horsley and Horsley Woodhouse ward: he had won the by-election in 2011 to replace Nigel Mills on that council.  Stevenson stood in 2024 as the Reform UK candidate for Amber Valley, finishing in second place ahead of Mills.

Following those defections Reform UK put up an unusually strong challenge in the 2023 Amber Valley elections, which in the end had the effect of splitting the right-wing vote and resulted in a large Labour majority being elected: Labour won 26 councillors against 7 Conservatives, 6 Greens, 2 Belper Independents and a single Lib Dem.  Reform UK polled 9.5% of the vote across the district and won nothing.  Codnor, Langley Mill and Aldercar ward easily returned the Labour slate with 40% of the vote against 25% for the Conservatives and 21% for Reform UK.

The Conservative collapse even extended to the Horsley county division, which now covers all of Smalley, Shipley and Horsley Woodhouse ward together with most of Kilburn, Denby, Holbrook and Horsley ward.  In results completely out of kilter with what had gone before, Smalley etc returned the Green Party slate in 2023 while Kilburn etc split its three seats between Linsey Farnsworth for Labour and two Conservative councillors.  Aggregating the votes in 2023 cast across the two wards gives 32% for the Conservatives, 29% for Labour, 22% for the Greens and 12% for Reform UK; this includes votes from Holbrook parish, which is not part of this division.

Linsey Farnsworth resigned her Amber Valley council seat after being elected to Parliament, and the resulting by-election in Kilburn, Denby, Holbrook and Horsley on the undercard of the May 2025 Derbyshire county council elections was gained by the Conservatives: this is one of three seats (so far) which Labour have lost in Amber Valley by-elections sincr 2023.  Vote shares in the by-election were 32% for the Conservatives, 25% for the Greens, 22% for the defending Labour candidate and 14% for independent candidate Alex Stevenson, who we will come back to in a moment.

That by-election in May 2025 had no Reform UK candidate, and things might otherwise have been different.  On the same day the Horsley county division was gained by Reform UK, with vote shares of 35% for RUK, 27% for the Greens, 23% for the Conservatives and 10% for Labour.  The Codnor, Aldercar, Langley Mill and Loscoe county division voted for Reform UK much more strongly.  In between Heanor division voted for Reform UK with second place going to Alex Stevenson, who by now had fallen out with RUK and was standing for re-election as an independent candidate.  Major division boundary changes mean that these results are not directly comparable with previous years, but the Conservatives had won all the predecessor seats in 2021.

The ruling Reform UK group on Derbyshire county council have already had to defend one by-election, which they narrowly held in Long Eaton North division last December.  By then this Horsley poll was already in the pipeline to replace Reform UK county councillor Richard Morgan, who stepped down in November on health grounds.  Meanwhile Labour are defending the Amber Valley council seat in Codnor, Langley Mill and Aldercar ward after David Moon handed in his notice.  Both Moon and Morgan were in their first terms of office.

Defending the Horsley county division for Reform UK is Juliette Stevens, who is seeking to return to Derbyshire county council after some years away: she was previously a Conservative and then UKIP county councillor for Heage from 2009 to 2013, and she also represented Heage and Ambergate ward on Amber Valley council from 2008 to 2012.  Stevens, who was an unccessful Reform UK candidate for Matlock division last year, works as an accountant and micro pig farmer, and she hit the headlines on a number of occasions in the late 2010s thanks to the supposed psychic abilities of her micro pig <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-derbyshire-44493221">"Mystic Marcus"</a>.  This pig probably has a better record than me when it comes to predicting elections.  Four of the five losing candidates for Horsley last year are back for another go, headed by the Green Party's Lian Pizzey: he is a youth worker who already represents Smalley, Shipley and Horsley Woodhouse ward on Amber Valley council and now has another chance to double up at county level.  The other Amber Valley councillor for that ward is Amanda Paget, who was originally elected in 2023 for the Green Party but has since defected to the Conservatives: she finished in third place in Horsley division last year.  Fourth last time was Labour's John Cowings, who was also the losing Labour candidate in the Kilburn etc ward district by-election on the same day.  Also on the ballot are Adrian Miller for the Lib Dems and Alex Stevenson, who is now standing as the first-ever election candidate for Advance UK: this is a new far-right outfit led by the former Refurm UK deputy leader Ben Habib.

In Codnor, Langley Mill and Aldercar ward the Labour defence is led by Mark Howard, who is the chairman of Codnor parish council.  The Conservatives have selected Jake Gilbert, a young Heanor and Loscoe town councillor who stood in this area at last year's county elections.  Reform UK's candidate Dave Chambers has recently retired from a long career with Derbyshire Police.  Also standing are Bess Saunders for the Greens, Gemma Davey for the Liberal Democrats, Bob Marshall for the Derbyshire Community Party and Alex Stevenson again for Advance UK.
