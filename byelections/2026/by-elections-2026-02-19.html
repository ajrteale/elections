<h2>Stoneygate</h2>

Leicester council; caused by the death of Labour councillor Manjula Sood.

And now for something completely different as we head into the city of Leicester.  The name of Stoneygate refers to a stone road, the Roman road running into Leicester from the south-east; this route has now been replaced by the London Road, part of the A6 towards Market Harborough.  On a hilltop above Victoria Park we find Stoneygate proper, which was once a high-class district of Victorian mansions and is described by the city council as "Leicester's best-surviving Victorian suburb".  Stoneygate ward is rather lasrger than this, running along the north side of London Road as far as Leicseter railway station.

Modern Leicester is a very multicultural city, and Stoneygate ward is no exception to this.  In the 2021 census Stoneygate made the top 40 wards in England and Wales for residents with Asian ethnicity (67.1%) and for Islam (59.1%).  The ward also made the top 30 for part-time employment (17.5%) and has a significant student population: Leicester University's Brookfield campus, home to the unversity's business school, lies within the ward boundary in Stoneygate proper.

The fact that Stoneygate ward is majority-Muslim points towards one of the shock results of the 2024 general election.  This area is part of the Leicester South constituency, which was one of four seats to return independent Muslim MPs two years ago on tickets which included opposition to the war in Gaza.  Leicester South was won by Shockat Adam, an optometrist who had never previosuly been involved in politics: Adam defeated high-profile Labour frontbencher Jonathan Ashworth by 979 votes.  And that wasn't the only Leicester seat which Labour lost: the Conservatives gained Leicester East against the national trend.

The warning signs had definitely been flashing for Labour in local elections over the previous few years.  The Conservatives - who had drawn a blank in the 2019 Leicester elections - made some spectacular by-election gains in the city in 2021 and 2022.  The ruling Labour group - which had won 53 seats out of a possible 54 in 2019 - was then put into special measures, with the Labour National Executive Committee ultimately deselecting 19 councillors for the 2023 elections.  Among the deselections were all three of the outgoing councillors for Stoneygate ward, Kirk Master, Sharmen Rahman and Mohammed Thalukdar.  Many of the deselected councillors stood for re-election in 2023 as independent candidates; none of them were successful.

Labour did hold on to Leicester in the 2023 local elections, with Sir Peter Soulsby being re-elected for his fourth term as mayor on a sharply reduced vote share: he won with 39% of the vote, against 30% for the Conservatives and 11% for the Lib Dems.  The simultaneous council election saw Labour lose 22 seats, finishing with a total of 31 against 17 Conservatives, 3 Lib Dems and 3 Greens.  This was comfortably one of the worst Labour performances of that year.

Stoneygate ward's result followed the citywide trend.  On a 46% turnout (an impressively high score for a UK local election), the Labour slate won with 40% of the vote against 24% for the Conservatives and 21% for an independent slate consisting of the three outgoing Labour councillors.

Elected in third place, significantly behind her Labour running-mates, was Manjula Sood who is apparently notable enough for Wikipedia.  Sood, who was born in the Indian Punjab and came to Leicester in the 1970s to work as a schoolteacher, had  previously sat on Leicester council from a 1996 by-election (in which she replaced her late husband) until 2019, and she was Lord Mayor of Leicester in 2008-09 - the first Asian woman to hold that post.  Following the end of her mayoral term, Sood was appointed MBE in the 2009 Birthday Honours for services to the commuity in Leicester.  She died on Christmas Eve, which was the day after her 80th birthday.

There is a lot of interest in the resulting by-election, with eight candidates standing.  Defending for Labour is Adam Sabat, who is a trustee of the Muslim Burial Council of Leicestershire.  The Conservatives have selected Rashmikant Joshi, a former long-serving Labour councillor (2005-23) who was Lord Mayor of Leicester in 2017-18; Joshi defected to the Conservatives after being deselected for the 2023 elections, and on that occasion he stood unsuccessfully as a Conservative candidate for the neighbouring Evington ward.  There are two independent candidates on the ballot: Michael Barker is associated with the Socialist Alternative and was originally endorsed by Your Party, but they have dropped him in favour of taxi driver and café owner Faisal Noor.  Also on the ballot are Asit Sodha for the Lib Dems, Aasiya Bora for the Green Party, Michael Dabrowski for Reform UK and Alef Uddin who is the first local election canididate for One Leicester, a party associated led by former independent Leicster mayoral candidate Rita Patel and associated with the former Leicester East MP Keith Vaz.  This column would like to take this opportunity to apologise to any readers who might still be playing the Keith Vaz game.
