Three by-elections on 19th February 2026:
</p><p>
<h2>Van</h2>
</p><p>
<em>Caerphilly council, Gwent; caused by the death of Labour councillor Christine Forehead.</em>
</p><p>
All three of today's by-elections are for seats being defended by the Labour Party.  We'll start with a quick return to the location of one of the most embarrassing Labour election performances of recent years: the town of Caerphilly, which was lost to Plaid Cymru in a Senedd by-election last October.
</p><p>
Caerphilly is of course dominated by its castle, which is in a bit of a ruinous state.  This isn't just down to the ravages of time: the Lewis family of the Van also bear quite a lot of responsibility.  The Lewises of the Van are descended from the old Gwynedd royal house and they were major landowners in Glamorgan for centuries, with all the political influence that supplied.  In 1580 Thomas Lewis sought and received permission to build a new manor house on the Van estate just to the east of Caerphilly, and he nicked quite a lot of Caerphilly Castle's stone to do it.  The Van Castle ended up by marriage in the hands of the Earls of Plymouth, who owned it until 1991: it is now a private residence.
</p><p>
The Van Castle gives its name to the eastern of Caerphilly town's six electoral wards.  Nearly all of Van ward's housing is postwar and it is dominated by two large council estates, the 1970s Mornington Meadows and the earlier 1960s housing of Lansbury Park, which is only a few minutes' walk from Caerphilly Castle (it's behind the Morrisons) but consistently ranks among the most deprived parts of Wales.  In the 2021 census Van ward made the top 75 in England and Wales for residents with no religion (58.4%) and the top 70 for residents who are out of work due to long-term sickness or disability (10.9%)
</p><p>
Your columnist visited Lansbury Park during October's by-election campaign, and the place was then full of Reform UK posters and stakeboards.  Which is somewhat ironic given the name of the estate, which refers to the former Labour Party leader George Lansbury.  Not only that, but all of the roads in Lansbury Park are named after long-dead Labour Party figures: Attlee Court, Wedgewood Court, Snowden Court, Maxton Court and so on.  The whole thing was officially opened in 1965 by Ness Edwards, who was then the Labour MP for Caerphilly.
</p><p>
There are less than three months to go now to the 2026 Senedd Cymru elections, in which October's by-election winner Lindsay Whittle MS has some work to do to hold his seat in the expanded constituency of Blaenau Gwent Caerffili Rhymni.  On the votes cast here in the 2024 Westminster election Blaenau Gwent Caerffili Rhymni would return three Labour candidates and one each for Plaid Cymru, the Conservatives and Reform UK (who didn't stand in Blaenau Gwent).  Obviously, a lot has changed since then.  Whittle has been placed in second on the Plaid Cymru list behind Delyth Jewell, an outgoing regional MS for South Wales East who outranks Whittle as the party's deputy leader; Labour's list will be headed by Alun Davies, the outgoing MS for Blaenau Gwent.  The Caerphilly Westminster seat is still in Labour hands and is represented by backbencher Chris Evans, who took the constituency over in 2024 after his previous Islwyn seat disappeared in boundary changes.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2022/caerphilly22s.svgz" alt="Caerphilly, 2022" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Caerphilly's Van ward was created in 2022 from the western two-thirds of the former St James ward, which had also included the village of Rudry to the east.  The old St James ward was closely fought between Labour and Plaid Cymru in this century, with Plaid winning in 2008 and not too far away from Labour in the other years.  There has only been one contest on the current lines, in 2022, in which the Labour slate won Van ward's two seats with a 55-45 lead over Plaid Cymru: that election was a straight fight between them.
</p><p>
Top of the Labour slate here in 2022 was Christine Forehead, who passed away in November at the age of 81.  Forehead was a political veteran whose service went back before the last reorganisation of Welsh local government, as she was first elected for St James ward in 1991 when the local authority here was Rhymney Valley council.  Forehead then transferred to Caerphilly council in 1995, lost her seat to Plaid Cymru in 2008 but got it back in 2012.  Her ward colleague, and Van ward's surviving councillor, is her daughter Elaine Forehead whose own council service goes back to 2004.
</p><p>
Defending this seat for Labour is Martin Ferris, who taught history at St Martin's School in Caerphilly for 22 years before taking up a full-time job with the NASUWT union.  Ferris also chairs the local Royal British Legion branch.  Returning from the 2022 election is Plaid Cymru's Jeff Grenfell, who sits on Van community council and works as a mechanical engineer.  This time we will not have a straight fight, with Russell Larke standing for Reform UK and Tony Potts for the Liberal Democrats.

<h2>Stoneygate</h2>
</p><p>
<em>Leicester council; caused by the death of Labour councillor Manjula Sood.</em>
</p><p>
And now for something completely different as we head into the city of Leicester.  The name of Stoneygate refers to a stone road, the Roman road running into Leicester from the south-east; this route has now been replaced by the London Road, part of the A6 towards Market Harborough.  Above Victoria Park we find Stoneygate proper, which was once a high-class district of Victorian mansions and is described by the city council as "Leicester's best-surviving Victorian suburb".  Stoneygate ward is rather larger than this, running towards the city centre along the north side of London Road as far as Leicester railway station.
</p><p>
Modern Leicester is a very multicultural city, and Stoneygate ward is no exception to this.  In the 2021 census Stoneygate made the top 40 wards in England and Wales for residents with Asian ethnicity (67.1%) and for Islam (59.1%).  The ward also made the top 30 for part-time employment (17.5%) and has a significant student population: Leicester University's Brookfield campus, home to the university's business school, lies within the ward boundary in Stoneygate proper.
</p><p>
The fact that Stoneygate ward is majority-Muslim points towards one of the shock results of the 2024 general election.  This area is part of the Leicester South constituency, which was one of four seats to return independent Muslim MPs two years ago on tickets which included opposition to the war in Gaza.  Leicester South was won by Shockat Adam, an optometrist who had never previously been involved in politics: Adam defeated high-profile Labour frontbencher Jonathan Ashworth by 979 votes.  And that wasn't the only Leicester seat which Labour lost: the Conservatives gained Leicester East against the national trend.
</p><p>
The warning signs had definitely been flashing for Labour in local elections over the previous few years.  The Conservatives - who had drawn a blank in the 2019 Leicester elections - made some spectacular by-election gains in the city in 2021 and 2022.  The ruling Labour group - which had won 53 seats out of a possible 54 in 2019 - was then put into special measures, with the Labour National Executive Committee ultimately deselecting 19 councillors for the 2023 elections.  Among the deselections were all three of the outgoing councillors for Stoneygate ward: Kirk Master, Sharmen Rahman and Mohammed Thalukdar.  Many of the deselected councillors stood for re-election in 2023 as independent candidates; none of those who did were successful.
</p><p>
Labour did hold on to Leicester in the 2023 local elections, with Sir Peter Soulsby being re-elected for his fourth term as mayor on a sharply reduced vote share: he won with 39% of the vote, against 30% for the Conservatives and 11% for the Lib Dems.  The simultaneous council election saw Labour lose 22 seats, finishing with a total of 31 against 17 Conservatives, 3 Lib Dems and 3 Greens.  This was comfortably one of the worst Labour performances of that year.
</p><p>
Stoneygate ward's result followed the citywide trend.  On a 46% turnout (an impressively high score for a UK local election), the Labour slate won with 40% of the vote against 24% for the Conservatives and 21% for an independent slate consisting of the three outgoing Labour councillors.
</p><p>
Elected in third place, significantly behind her Labour running-mates, was Manjula Sood who is apparently notable enough for Wikipedia.  Sood, who was born in the Indian Punjab and came to Leicester in the 1970s to work as a schoolteacher, had  previously sat on Leicester council from a 1996 by-election (in which she replaced her late husband) until 2019, and she was Lord Mayor of Leicester in 2008-09 - the first Asian woman to hold that post.  Following the end of her mayoral term, Sood was appointed MBE in the 2009 Birthday Honours for services to the community in Leicester.  She died on Christmas Eve, which was the day after her 80th birthday.
</p><p>
There is a lot of interest in the resulting by-election, with eight candidates standing.  Defending for Labour is Adam Sabat, who is a trustee of the Muslim Burial Council of Leicestershire.  The Conservatives have selected Rashmikant Joshi, a former long-serving Labour councillor (2005-23) who was Lord Mayor of Leicester in 2017-18; Joshi defected to the Conservatives after being deselected for the 2023 elections, and on that occasion he stood unsuccessfully as a Conservative candidate for the neighbouring Evington ward.  There are two independent candidates on the ballot: Michael Barker is associated with the Socialist Alternative and was originally endorsed by Your Party, but they have dropped him in favour of taxi driver and café owner Faisal Noor.  Also on the ballot are Asit Sodha for the Lib Dems, Aasiya Bora for the Green Party, Michael Dabrowski for Reform UK and Alef Uddin who is the first local election candidate for One Leicester, a party led by former independent Leicester mayoral candidate Rita Patel and associated with the former Leicester East MP Keith Vaz.  This column would like to take this opportunity to apologise to any readers who might still be playing the Keith Vaz game.  The Local Democracy Reporting Service have interviewed most of the candidates, and you can find out more <a href="https://www.leicester.news/the-candidates-you-can-vote-for-in-the-stoneygate-byelection/">here (link)</a>.

<h2>Zetland</h2>
</p><p>
<em>Redcar and Cleveland council, North Yorkshire; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Jonny Neal.</em>
</p><p>
There's only one way to end this week, and that's with the UK's last ward alphabetically.  Zetland is in fact the only UK ward whose name begins with a Z.  (Second-last alphabetically is Ystwyth ward in Ceredigion; first alphabetically is Abbey which is a very common ward name.)
</p><p>
Zetland is an archaic form of the name Shetland, which is quite a long sea voyage from Redcar.  The Zetland connection to this corner of Yorkshire came from Sir Thomas Dundas, the first Lord Dundas, a Scottish businessman and politician of the late 18th century who had bought the lordship of Zetland from the Earl of Morton.  His son Lawrence Dundas, who lived at the mansion house of Marske Hall near Redcar and served as an MP for both York and Richmond (Yorkshire) in the early 19th century, was then promoted from Lord to Earl in 1838 to mark the coronation of Queen Victoria, and he took the title Earl of Zetland.  Six generations and another promotion later, the 5th Marquess of Zetland Robin Dundas inherited the title last month from his father.
</p><p>
It was around 1838 or 1839 that Redcar's lifeboat - which didn't previously have a name - was also christened as the <em>Zetland</em>.  The <em>Zetland</em> had been built in South Shields in 1802, and she remained in service until 1864 when the RNLI gave her to the people of the town, on condition that she would not compete with the replacement lifeboat.  Still on display in Redcar today as a museum ship, the <em>Zetland</em> is the world's oldest lifeboat and the sixth-oldest vessel on the National Historic Fleet register.  (The five older ships are the 18th-century Manx yacht <em>Peggy</em>, Prince Frederick's Barge and <em>Queen Mary's Shallop</em> in the National Maritime Museum at Greenwich, and the <em>Victory</em> and <em>Mary Rose</em> in Portsmouth.)
</p><p>
The Zetland electoral ward is Redcar's eastern seafront, lying between the railway line (Redcar East railway station is on the ward boundary) and the town's wide, sandy beach which runs all the way from the Tees estuary to Saltburn.  It was the presence of this beach which led Redcar to stand in for Dunkirk in the 2007 film <em>Atonement</em>.  Zetland ward is a residential area, with the beach and Zetland Park being the main open spaces: it is otherwise full of semi-detached houses, and in the 2021 census Zetland made the top 30 wards in England and Wales for semi-detached housing at 72.8% of the ward's households.
</p><p>
The Redcar parliamentary seat has a complicated history, having voted for all three of the main Westminster parties at some point this century.  Its current MP is Anna Turley, the Labour Party chair and minister without portfolio, who recovered in 2024 a seat which she had lost to the Conservatives' Jacob Young five years previously.
</p><p>
Labour are also the largest party on Redcar and Cleveland council, which has been hung since 2013.  The most recent election in 2023 returned 23 Labour councillors, 13 independents, 12 Conservatives and 11 Lib Dems; a Labour minority administration is running the show.  By-elections since 2023 have seen Labour lose Longbeck ward to the Conservatives, who then lost Skelton East ward to Reform UK.
</p><p>
Zetland ward, like the Redcar constituency, has returned councillors from all three of the main Westminster parties in this century.  It narrowly voted Conservative in 2003, before Labour gained one of the two seats in 2007.  The Lib Dems then gained both of Zetland ward's seats in 2011, but their councillors Jim Rogers and Ron Harrison then became embroiled in a dispute as to whether they were disqualified from the council because they worked as teachers at a foundation school with council funding.  No definitive answer to this question was reached before Rogers and Harrison forced the issue by resigning their seats; Harrison, who had quit his job at the school, then successfully sought re-election in the resulting November 2011 double by-election.
</p><p>
Since then the Conservatives have been out of the running in Zetland ward, which split its seats between the Lib Dems and Labour in 2015, voted Lib Dem in 2019 (when the current ward boundaries were introduced) and voted Labour in 2023.  Shares of the vote here three years ago were 47% for Labour, 35% for the Lib Dems and 18% for the Conservatives.
</p><p>
In October 2025 the two Labour councillors for Zetland ward, Jade Lavan and Jonny Neal, both quit the party to become independent councillors.  Neal then submitted his resignation just before the New Year, provoking this by-election.
</p><p>
Labour will want their defection loss back and they have selected Mitchell Rynn.  The Liberal Democrats have reselected Alison Barnes, who was previously a councillor for this ward from 2019 and 2023 and wants back the seat which she lost three years ago.  The Conservative candidate Igraine Gray is a published author who used to be a rough sleeper: she fought Loftus ward in 2023.  Also standing are Michael Manning, who is on the ballot paper as a Reform UK candidate but has been disowned by that party for being racist on social media; and the Green Party's Brian Teasdale.
