Manchester is one of three big UK cities whose centres are entirely encircled by motorways. The other two are Birmingham and Glasgow (London doesn't count as the Dartford Crossing is not a motorway), both of which are quite homogeneous within their tarmac boxes with the big city socially and administratively dominant. However, Manchester city council only covers around half of the area bounded by the M60 ring road; the rest of that area is a patchwork of cities and towns big and small which may be part of the same urban area but have their own distinct identities. Two of these are Denton and Reddish.

Denton may be just outside the motorway, but it's only five miles east of Manchester city centre and rather more dependent on the big city than it might like to admit. Like many of the towns in south-east Lancashire, it was a product of the Industrial Revolution; unlike many towns in south-east Lancashire, the main industry here was the manufacture of felt hats. This was so important to the local economy that in the 1921 census over 40% of the town's workforce was working in the hat factories or in related occupations such as the Oldham Batteries factory (which despite its name maintained a sideline making hatting machinery).

This area has a complicated parliamentary history, partly because only one corner of it was within the Manchester city boundary when single-member constituencies became the norm at the Third Reform in 1885.  That was Longsight, which was part of the parish of Rusholme until it was annexed by Manchester in that year, and was included within the original Manchester South constituency.  Levenshulme and the Burnage area (which would become part of the big city by the time the First World War broke out) were at this point within the Stretford division of Lancashire, whle there was also a Gorton division of Lancashire which combined Gorton with Denton.

<!--Gorton 1885-1918-->

For the first ten years of its existence the Gorton constituency was dominated by the Liberals.  Appropriately enough its first MP was the Liberal Richard Peacock, who had perhaps done more than anyone else for the nineteenth-century development of Gorton and Openshaw.  Peacock had made his career as a railway engineer.  He started in 1838 as an 18-year-old locomotive superintendent for the Leeds and Selby Railway; he founded the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway's locomotive works at Gorton in the 1840s; and he then became the Peacock in Beyer, Peacock and Company which supplied railway locomotives to the UK and the world from their foundry in Gorton.

Richard Peacock is still in Gorton today, lying at rest in his mausoleum at the Brookfield Unitarian Church on the Hyde Road - a church which he had commissioned in the late 1860s.  He was still the MP for Gorton at the time of his death in 1889, and the resulting Gorton by-election returned another Liberal MP very much in Peacock's image.  William Mather was from the Mather family that owned the Salford Iron Works, and he was a senior partner (from 1892, chairman) of the engineering firm Mather and Platt which was a major employer in the Newton Heath area.  (The Mather and Platt company is still going today: now trading as M & P Engineering, they have a factory in Trafford Park making equipment for the food processing industry.)  William Mather had been elected in 1885 as the first MP for Salford South, but had lost that seat the following year; the Gorton by-election was a quick return to the Commons for him.  He defeated the Conservative candidate Ernest Hatch by an increased majority of 846 votes; that majority reduced to 222 at the 1892 election.

William Mather didn't seek re-election in Gorton in 1895, and the Liberals gave up their seat by standing down in favour of a former Liberal who was now in the Independent Labour Party.  This was the last of several unsuccessful election campaigns before his 1898 death for Richard Pankhurst, a barrister and strong supporter of women's rights.  Although he never made it into the Commons, Pankhurst's legacy was one of the first major pieces of equality legislation: he had drafted the bill which became the Married Women's Property Act 1882, giving wives (rather than their husbands) control over their own property and earnings.  Presumably his own wife approved of this: Richard was the husband of Emmeline Pankhurst, who was already prominent in the women's suffrage movement, and he was the father of her three daughters Christabel, Sylvia and Adela, who were all aged between 15 and 10 at this point.  Their suffragette careers came later.

Richard Pankhurst was rather soundly defeated in the 1895 election by the Conservatives' Ernest Hatch, who won at the third attempt to become the first Conservative MP for Gorton.  Hatch was a wine merchant who had recently gone into business with the former first-class cricketer James Mansfield, forming Hatch, Mansfield and Company.  He was re-elected rather more narrowly in the khaki election of 1900, defeating a joint Liberal-Labour candidate by 520 votes.

Ernest Hatch crossed the floor to the Liberals in 1905, disagreeing with the Conservatives over free trade.  The Gorton Liberals were not interested in adopting him as their candidate in the 1906 general election, and he retired.  The Conservatives failed to recover their defection loss and were thrashed in the election by former Manchester city councillor John Hodge, standing for the Labour Representation Committee.  Hodge was a trade union leader from the Scottish iron industry, having been the founding secretary of the British Steel Smelters' Association in 1885.

After holding his seat rather more narrowly in both 1910 elections, John Hodge made it into government under the Lloyd George coalition of December 1916 as the first Minister of Labour, with a seat in Cabinet.  He was a strong supporter of the Great War, and despite his trade unionism Hodge broke a boilermakers' strike during his tenure by threatening the strikers with the Defence of the Realm Act.  In 1917 he was reshuffled to become Minister for Pensions.

<!-- Stretford 1885-1918 -->

In the meantime, as stated, Levenshulme and Burnage were part of the Stretford constituency which had very different boundaries to the modern seat of Stretford and Urmston: it also took in areas like Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Withington, Didsbury, Heaton Mersey and Reddish, all of which would soon be annexed by Manchester or Stockport.  As such this was a suburban constituency whose electorate saw huge growth during this period: from 11,140 at the 1885 election to 27,629 in December 1910.

The first MP for Stretford was the Liberal William Agnew, who had previously represented the South-East Lancashire constituency since 1880.  Agnew was one of the Sons in Thomas Agnew and Sons, the London fine art dealership which during this period became the go-to firm for sales of Old Masters.  He defeated John Maclure of the Conservatives by 4,866 votes to 4,676, a majority of 190.

Maclure got his revenge the following year, defeating Agnew by 739 votes.  As well as being one of the prime movers of Conservatism in the Manchester area at the time, Maclure was a businessman in the insurance industry and he had also been involved in the relief efforts during the 1860s Lancashire cotton famine.  In 1892 he increased his majority over Agnew to 1,345, and nobody bothered to oppose his re-election in 1895.  He was made a baronet in 1898.

Sir John Maclure died in 1901, aged 65, and he is commemorated by a stained-glass window in Manchester Cathedral; helpfully in this regard, his brother was the Dean of Manchester.  The resulting Stretford by-election of February 1901 was held for the Conservatives by another prominent Anglican, Charles Cripps.  The father of the Labour politician Sir Stafford Cripps, Charles was a barrister who had previously served in the 1895 parliament as Conservative MP for Stroud; he had lost his seat in 1900, so this was a quick return to the green benches for him.  During his tenure as MP for Stretford Cripps was appointed as attorney-general to the Prince of Wales, the future George V (he had served the future Edward VII in the same capacity) and became Vicar-General of Canterbury, concentrating on church affairs.  He later served as MP for Wycombe from 1910 and was promoted to the House of Lords in 1914 as Lord Parmoor, serving on the Lords' judicial committee despite having never been a judge.  Parmoor eventually ended up in the Labour Party, and he was Leader of the Lords in both Macdonald governments.

All this lay in the future in 1906, when the Liberal landslide swept Charles Cripps away as MP for Stretford.  The new Liberal MP for the seat was Harry Nuttall, an import and export merchant who was president of the Manchester Chamber of Commerce in 1905, and who had strong support from the 5,000 Manchester freeholders who were eligible to vote in the Stretford county constituency.  Nuttall had got nowhere against John Maclure in 1900, but he pulled off a swing of nearly 18% to unseat Cripps with a majority of 2,824.  He was re-elected in both 1910 elections, although his majority fell to 876 in December 1910.  Arthur Samuel, who was the defeated Conservative candidate here in both 1910 polls and later had a prominent government career between the wars, polled 10,467 votes in December - a score which would have won nearly any other constituency.

<!-- Manchester South 1995-1918 -->

Meanwhile Longsight was part of the Manchester South constituency, which covered south Manchester as that city existed in 1885 - plus some clearly-associated parts like the Belle Vue area, which at this point was a detached part of Newton Heath parish known as Kirkmanshulme.  There was also a small detached part of Gorton parish between Belle Vue and Longsight which was included in the seat.  As well as Longsight, the Manchester South constituency took in Rusholme, Moss Side - which in those days was a fashionable middle-class suburb - and the Chorlton-on-Medlock area which then, as now, was dominated by what would become Manchester University.

Manchester South was a marginal seat whose electorate strongly grew during this period.  Its first MP was strongly associated with the University.  Sir Henry Roscoe, elected here in 1885 on the Liberal ticket, was a noted chemist who had done a lot of work to advance the scientific understanding of the metal vanadium and its compounds.  He had also extensively collaborated with the German scientist Robert Bunsen, whose eponymous gas burner you might remember from your school chemistry lessons: together, Roscoe and Bunsen are thought to have taken the first flash photograph in 1864, using a magnesium wire as the light source.  Roscoe's political career burned rather longer than that: he represented Manchester South for ten years, and lost his seat in 1895 by only 78 votes.

The new Liberal Unionist MP for Manchester South was genuine royalty.  John George Edward Henry Douglas Sutherland Campbell, Marquess of Lorne, was not altogether happily married to Queen Victoria's daughter Princess Louise.  He was also the heir to the dukedom of Argyll, and he had previously served as MP for Argyllshire for ten years from 1868 until he left these shores in 1878 to become Governor-General of Canada.  Lorne left his mark on Canada, where a large number of places and other things are named after him: there is still a Canadian infantry regiment in existence called the Lorne Scots.  However, he made little impact in Parliament, and the <em>London World</em> went so far as to label him as "a non-entity in the House of Commons, and a non-entity without".

In 1900 John Campbell succeeded to his father's titles and entered the Lords as the 9th Duke of Argyll.  For the resulting first Manchester South by-election of 25th May 1900 the Liberal Unonists selected another scion of the upper class.  This by-election marked the entry into national politics of William Peel, who would later become the first Earl Peel and serve in a number of Cabinet positions in the 1920s.  He was a grandson of the prime minister Sir Robert Peel and son of Arthur Peel, who had been Speaker of the Commons from 1884 to 1895.  William Peel had recently been elected to the London County Council as a Municipal Reform member for Woolwich in a February 1900 by-election.  In the Manchester South parliamentary by-election three months later Peel pulled off an 11% swing towards the government, increasing the Liberal Unionist majority from 78 votes to 2,039 - a harbinger of the good Conservative performance in the "khaki" 1900 general election later that year, when Peel was re-elected with a further swing in his favour.  His Liberal opponent in the by-election was Leif Jones, who was associated with the temperance movement and would later serve as a Liberal MP for four non-consecutive spells in three different constituencies.

In 1906 William Peel left our story to seek re-election in Harrow, which he lost.  Manchester South's electorate had grown by 2,500 since 1900, and this may have been helpful in enabling the Liberals to gain the seat on a swing of 25%, turning a Liberal deficit of 43-57 into a lead of 69-32.  The new Liberal MP Arthur Haworth was a businessman from the Manchester textile industry, and in 1909 he became chairman of the Royal Exchange.  Haworth was re-elected in both 1910 elections, winning the December 1910 election unopposed - we'll come back to that in a moment.  In 1911 he was made a baronet.

Sir Arthur Haworth was then appointed to a government position in 1912 as a Lord Commissioner of the Treasury.  In those days this was seen as accepting an office of profit under the Crown, meaning that Haworth's Parliamentary seat was vacated and he would have to seek re-election from his constituents.  Ministerial by-elections were often a formality and normally left uncontested, but they were nonetheless a risk.  The list of MPs who lost their seats in ministerial by-elections is a short one, but it does include a famous name: Winston Churchill had been unseated in 1908 in Manchester North West when was appoinated as President of the Board of Trade.

The Conservatives' Philip Glazebrook had unfinished businsess from the December 1910 election in which he was supposed to have been the Conservative candidate for Manchester South - but he had turned up to Manchester town hall to submit his nomination six minutes after the deadline, as a result of an error by his agent.  For the second Manchester South by-election of 5th March 1902  Glazebrook made no mistake, and he put up a strong campaign on the issues of Irish home rule, National Insurance and women's suffrage.  He pulled off an 11-point swing to win the by-election by 579 votes, and Sir Arthur Haworth's ministerial career was over before it had begun.  Before the decade was out, the Lloyd George Liberal government had taken the first steps towards abolishing ministerial by-elections - but this came too late for someone who we will meet later in this preview.

Philip Glazebrook was a Manchester businessman and he was also an officer in the Cheshire Yeomanry.  This meant that he went to war when the First World War broke out two years later.  Major Glazebrook spent the war in Egypt and then Palestine, where he was appointed DSO in February 1918 and was then killed in action at Bireh on 7th March 1918.  He is buried at the British military cemetery in Jerusalem.  The resulting third Manchester South by-election of 22nd March 1918 returned the Conservatives' Robert Stoker, chairman of the Manchester Liners shipping line, who was returned unopposed as the last MP for Manchester South thanks to the wartime political truce.

<!--1918: Mossley 35.3 Mcr Rusholme 27.0 Mcr Gorton 21.9 Mcr Withington 13.9 Mcr Ardwick 1.5 Stockport 0.5-->

<!-- Mcr Gorton 1918-50 -->

The 1918 redistribution divorced Gorton from Denton for the first time, as by now Gorton (along with Levenshulme, and Burnage) was part of the City of Manchester.  The expanded city was granted ten MPs, up from six on the previous boundaries, and three of its contstituencies contained substantial parts of the modern Gorton and Denton.  One of these was Manchester Gorton itself, which roughly corresponded to the modern Gorton and Abbey Hey ward plus the Openshaw half of the modern Clapton and Openshaw ward.  The fact that one-and-a-half modern Manchester wards were enough to be a constituency in 1918 says something about how much this area has depopulated over the last century.

The interwar Manchester Gorton constituency was an industrial area which proved to be a safe Labour seat in practice, except for the disaster of 1931.  The previous Gorton MP John Hodge stayed on until 1923, when he successfully passed his seat on to Labour's Joseph Compton.  Compton lost his seat to the Conservatives' Eric Bailey in 1931, but got it back in 1935; Bailey is still the last Conservative MP to represent Gorton proper.

Joseph Compton died in January 1937 at the early age of 55.  The resulting first Manchester Gorton by-election of 18th February 1937 pitted the Conservatives' Alexander Spearman, a stockbroker, against a political veteran.  William Wedgwood Benn had first been elected to Parliament back in 1906 as a Liberal MP for the St George's division of Tower Hamlets.  He transferred to Leith at the 1918 general election, but in 1927 Benn quit both the seat and the Liberal Party in order to join Labour.  Benn returned to Parliament the following year as a Labour MP by winning the Aberdeen North by-election, and he served in Cabinet during the second Macdonald government as India secretary; but he had lost his seat in the 1931 landslide.  Gorton proved to the final berth of Benn's long and winding Commons career, as he won the 1937 by-election by 4,758 votes with a slight swing to Labour.

Five years later Benn was promoted to the House of Lords as the first Viscount Stansgate - a decision which would later give his son Tony Benn some trouble.  The resulting second Manchester Gorton by-election of 11th March 1942 was held under the wartime political truce, and nobody opposed the Labour candidate William Oldfield who had previously been Benn's election agent.  Oldfield was a long-serving Manchester city councillor who worked in the cotton mills and had strong links to the cotton spinners' unions.  He was very easily re-elected in 1945.

<!-- Mcr Rusholme 1918-50 -->

During the interwar years Levenshulme, Longsight and Belle Vue formed the majority of the new Manchester Rusholme constituency.  All of these were respectable middle-class suburbs in the first half of the 20th century, and Rusholme voted accordingly: Rusholme in its first incarnation was a Conservative seat in all but two elections.  Its first contest in December 1918 was won easily by the Conservatives' Robert Stoker, who had won the main predcessor seat of Manchester South in an unopposed by-election earlier in the year.  His opponents included one of Parliament's first female candidates: the Labour nomination in Rusholme went to the suffragist Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence, who finished in third place and narrowly saved her deposit.

Stoker died in 1919 at the age of 60, following a long illness.  The resulting first Manchester Rusholme by-election of 7th October 1919 saw Labour nominate Robert Dunstan, a doctor who had served in the Royal Army Medical Corps during the war; the Liberals put up William Pringle, a former MP for North West Lanarkshire who was trying to get back in to Parliament after losing his seat the previous year; and the Conservative candidate was John Thorpe, a barrister who is probably now best known as the father of the Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe.  Thorpe was elected easily, with a strong swing to Labour putting Dunstan in second place.

But Labour couldn't make this performance stick, and when Thorpe lost his seat in 1923 it was not to Labour candidate and Communist William Paul: it was to the Liberals' Charles Masterman.  This proved to be the final act of an accident-prone Parliamentary career for Masterman, who was first elected in 1906 as the Liberal MP for West Ham North.  He had been unseated in 1911 by the Election Court for overspending on his December 1910 re-election campaign; Masterman's election agent accepted responsibility for this, admitting to the Court that he had suffered a breakdown during the campaign.

Masterman quickly got back onto the green benches by winning a by-election in Bethnal Green South West, and he just as quickly found himself on the frontline of politics trying to get the Liberal government's social and welfare reform measures through Parliament.  This included the National Insurance Act 1911, which introduced National Insurance and its contributions to the UK workforce for the first time.  Masterman had been responsible fur securing the passage of Part I of the 1911 Act, relating to health insurance.  But this made him enemies, and matters came to a head in 1914 when Masterman joined Asquith's cabinet as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.

Readers who have been paying attention will have guessed what's coming next: yes, it's our old friend the ministerial by-election again.  Masterman was taken on the February 1914 Bethnal Green South West by-election by the Conservatives' Sir Matthew Wilson, by Horatio Bottomley's right-wing magazine <em>John Bull</em>, by the suffragette movement (even though he was in favour of women's suffrage) and by the Northcliffe press.  It all proved too much for Masterman who lost to Wilson by 24 votes, with an Independent Labour spoiler candidate polling 316.  The government inserted Masterman into a further by-election in Ipswich in May 1914, which he also lost, and he was forced to resign from the Cabinet.  Instead Masterman spent most of the First World War trying to influence the general public as head of the War Propoganda Bureau at Wellington House.  It took until 1923 for Masterman to get back in Parliament as MP for Manchester Rusholme, for what proved to be a short and relatively uninfluential final term.

Charles Masterman was soundly defeated in the 1924 general election by Boyd Merriman, who returned Manchester Rusholme to its previous status of a safe Consrvative seat.  Merriman was a prominent barrister whose legal career blossomed during this period.  He became Solicitor General in 1928, receiving the customary knighthood, and again in 1932, and he then left the Commons in 1933 to become president of the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division of the High Court.

The resulting second Manchester Rusholme by-election of 21st November 1933 was one of the many Labour parliamentary campaigns of the Reverend George Woods, a Unitarian minister who contested an an impressive range of constituencies over a long career - we will meet him again later.  Woods got an impressive swing to Labour, but the Conservatives' Edmund Radford still won comfortably enough.  Radford was a chartered accountant who had previously been the Conservative MP for Salford South in the 1924-29 Parliament; Rusholme proved to be a safer berth for him.

Edmund Radford died in May 1944 at the age of 63.  The resulting third Mnachester Rusholme by-election of 8th July 1944 was held under the wartime political truce but was nonetheless contested.  In fact the Conservatives' Frederick Cundiff, a local businessman, faced a strong challenge from the Common Wealth candidate Harold Blomerley which he only fought off by 1,760 votes.  This was a harbinger of things to come.

Cundiff served in Rusholme for less than a year before he lost his seat in the 1945 Attlee landslide.  Manchester Rusholme turned in one of the closest results of that election, with Labour's Lester Hutchinson defeating Cundiff by 15,408 votes to 15,398, a majority of ten.  Hutchinson was a Communist sympathiser who ended up being expelled from the Labour Party in 1949 for opposing the North Atlantic Treaty: he then joined the Labour Independent Group in Parliament, which consisted of him and four other fellow travllers including Konni Zilliacus, of whom more later.

<!-- Mcr Withington 1918-50 -->

While all this was going on in Rusholme, the Burnage area was part of the Mancheter Withington constituency which also covered areas like Didsbury, Whalley Range and Chorlton-cum-Hardy.  This was a similar seat to Rusholme in terms of its middle-class professional demographic, and as in Rusholme the Conservatives only lost two elections here in the period 1918-50.  The Withington seat also saw strong population growth, and by 1945 its electorate was over twice that of the other Manchester constituencies.

The first Conservative MP for Withington was Rei Alfred Deakin Carter, a bank manager and alderman of Manchester city council who served only one term in the Commons.  His retirement in 1922 set the scene for four contests here in the 1920s between Conservative Thomas Watts and Liberal candidate Ernest Simon.  Watts won the 1922 and 1924 elections; Simon, an industrialist who in 1921--22 became at the time the youngest Lord Mayor of Manchester, won in 1923 (by 11,678 votes to 11,008, a majority of 670) and 1929 (by 1,885 votes).  Thomas Watts got a knighthood for his political service, but of the two Ernest Simon was the one who had the most lasting impact on society: as well as being one of the first investors in the <em>New Statesman</em>, he was prominent in Manchester's slum clearance efforts.  To that end, in 1926 Simon bought the stately home and estate of Wythenshawe Hall and donated it to the city for new housing.  He was elevated to the Lords in 1947 as Lord Simon of Wythenshawe, and chaired the BBC Governors for five years.

Simon didn't seek re-election in Withington in 1931 (he instead contested Penryn and Falmouth, without success) and Edward Fleming regained the seat for the Conservatives with a large majority which wasn't seriously threatened thereafter.

<!-- Mossley 1918-50 -->

THe final piece of the puzzle here in the 1918-50 period was Denton, which was still an independent urban district.  The 1918 redistribution created a new constituency called Mossley, which as well as the town of that name wrapped around the northern side of Ashton-under-Lyne to take in Lees, Failsworth, Droylsden, Audenshaw and Denton.  Effectively, this seat was everything in this particular corner of Lancashire which didn't fit into Manchester to the west, Ashton-under-Lyne to the south-east or Oldham to the north.

Throughout its existence the Mossley constituency was dominated by the figure of Austin Hopkinson. An industrialist from an academic family (his father had been vice-chancellor of Manchester University, and served as an MP for the Combined English Universities), Hopkinson had fought in the Boer War and the Great War, in between inventing a revolutionary coal-cutting machine. He got his leg-up into Parliament in 1918 when Oswald Cawley, the Liberal MP for the Prestwich seat which previously covered most of the small towns north and east of Manchester, was killed in action in Palestine. Hopkinson won the resulting Prestwich by-election without a contest, and he started his unconventional parliamentary career as he meant to go on by taking his seat in the Commons while wearing his Royal Dragoon Guards uniform.

The Prestwich constituency was broken up shortly afterwards by the 1918 redistribution, and Hopkinson decided to seek re-election in the new Mossley constituency which covered his main political powerbase in Audenshaw.  He won easily with the coupon and that set him up for a long parliamentary career as essentially an independent MP.  Hopkinson lost Mossley only twice: in 1929, to Labour; and at his last election in 1945 when he lost his deposit and Labour won convincingly.

The first time Hopkinson lost in 1929 it was to Labour's Herbert Gibson, who worked in local government and was heavily involved in the co-operative movement.  Gibson enjoyed a majority of 5,029 votes in 1929 but lost the rematch to Hopkinson in 1931 by 1,430 votes with the Conservatives close behind in third.  A second rematch between Gibson and Hopkinson in 1935 saw Hopkinson's majority increase to 2,170.

Austen Hopkinson's political career was finally ended in the 1945 Attlee landslide.  This is where Labour's Reverend George Woods comes back into the story.  In the 1935-45 Parliament Woods had been the MP for Finsbury in London, but he sought re-election here.

<!-- Droylsden 1950-55 -->

The 1950 redistribution transferred Mossley town into the Ashton-under-Lyne constituency and Lees into the new seat of Oldham East, with the remaining four towns in the Mossley seat constituting the new and short-lived Droylsden constituency.  The Revd Woods sought re-election here in 1950, winning by 4,136 votes.  He then died in July 1951 at the age of 65, and his seat was vacant going into the general election that October.  The Labour party selected William Williams, a Welshman who had lost his seat the previous year in the Middlesex constituency of Heston and Isleworth; Williams had represented that seat since 1945 after previously being assistant secretary of the Post Office Workers' Union.  He won Droylsden with a reduced majority of 1,870.

<!-- Mcr Ardwick 1950-55 -->

Meanwhile, the 1950 redistribution had cut the number of MPs for Manchester - which by now had expanded to include Wythenshawe - from ten to nine.  One of the seats which disappeared was Manchester Rusholme, taking Labour Independent Group MP Leslie Hutchinson with it: he decided to seek re-election by taking on Clement Attlee as the Labour Independent Group candidate for Walthamstow West, and finished last with 2% of the vote.  Longsight and Belle Vue were transferred out of Hutchinson's seat into the Manchester Ardwick constituency, which also covered a very industrial/slum area to the south-east of the city centre.  Ardwick was an open seat taken over in this election by Labour's Leslie Lever, whose brother Harold was already a Manchester Labour MP.  The Levers were a family of solicitors and philanthrophists who did a lot of work for the poor, which gave Leslie - who was Lord Mayor of Manchester in 1957-58 - a strong personal vote in the area.  This was despite the fact that slum clearance saw his constituency's electorate fall sharply during his 20 years in office.

<!-- Mcr Withington 1950-55 -->

This wasn't a problem for Manchester Withington, which was severely oversized and needed to be cut down at the 1950 election.  Didsbury went into the the new Manchester Wythenshawe constituency and Chorlton-cum-Hardy and Whalley Range were transferred to Manchester Moss Side, leaving the Withington seat consisting only of Withington, Burnage and Rusholme (transferred in from the abolished Manchester Rusholme).  Withington's previous MP Edward Fleming decided to transfer to Manchester Moss Side, which had been flipped from a Labour seat into a safe Conservative seat by the transfer of Chorlton; in the event, he died six days before polling day and the 1950 election in Moss Side had to be postponed in consequence.

That meant that 1950 Withington election saw a return to the Commons for the Conservatives' Frederick Cundiff, following his defeat in Rusholme in 1945, but this proved to by short-lived as Cundiff then stood down at the 1951 election.  He was replaced by Sir Robert Cary, who himself made a return to the Commons after serving for Eccles in the 1935-45 Parliament.  Cary, who had served in both World Wars, got onto the lowest rungs of the Conservative frontbench during his political career but never any further up the greasy pole than that.

<!-- Mcr Gorton 1950-55 -->

For the final piece of the jigsaw, the Manchester Gorton constituency was expanded southwards in 1950 to take in Levenshulme.  The Conservative candidate for this seat in 1950 was Agatha Christie's nephew James Watts, but there was no mystery as to the winner in this seat: Labour's William Oldfield was re-elected in both 1950 and 1951 without fuss.

<!--1955: Mcr Gorton 57.2 Mcr Withington 28.5 Mcr Ardwick 13.9 Stockport N 0.5-->

<!-- Mcr Gorton 1955-83 -->

There was further boundary upheaval here in 1955, when the Boundary Commission drew two seats which crossed the city of Manchester's eastern boundary.  One of these was more or less a recreation of the old Gorton constituency including Denton, now with the name Manchetser Gorton, as the Droylsden constituency disappared after just five years and Denton - this time along with Audenshaw - was transferred back into what was by now called the Manchester Gorton constituency.  To make room for this, Levenshulme was moved into Manchester Withington and Rusholme transferred from Withington to Ardwick.

The previous Gorton MP William Oldfield stood down and Droylsden's MP William Williams chose to seek re-election in Manchester Openshaw, so Gorton was an open seat.  At this point the curious figure of Konni Zilliacus comes into the story.  Born in Japan to a Finnish father and American mother, Zilliacus had worked for the League of Nations between the wars, and after becoming Labour MP for Gateshead in the Attlee landslide he planted himself firmly on the party's left wing, to the point where he was thrown out of Labour in 1949 for his pro-Soviet views. By 1952 Labour and Zilliacus had patched up their quarrel and he was selected for the redrawn Manchester Gorton seat. The 1955 boundary changes, together with some distrust of Zilliacus, meant that he beat the Conservatives by just 269 votes. In that context Zilliacus did well to hold the seat against the Macmillan landslide of 1959, increasing his majority to 857, and the seat then became safe for Labour in the two 1960s elections.

Konni Zilliacus died in 1967, leaving Labour with the task of defending a tricky by-election. The Conservatives took the seat seriously with a young candidate who had serious name recognition. Winston Churchill, the grandson of the wartime prime minister of the same name, was at this point a young <em>Times</em> journalist who had distinguished himself with his reporting on the Six-Day War five months previously. He was up against Labour candidate Kenneth Marks, a headteacher, NUT figure and Denton urban district councillor. Churchill junior pulled off a swing to the Conservatives of over 9%, but it wasn't enough and Marks won the Manchester Gorton by-election with a majority of 557.  Marks wasn't seriously challenged after that, and he served until 1983 when the Gorton seat was heavily redrawn.

<!-- Mcr Withington 1955-83 -->

Levenshulme and Rushulme were now in the constituency of the Conservatives' Sir Robert Cary who went on to represent Withington for 23 years, seeing off three future Labour MPs in the process.  Robert Sheldon (Ashton-under-Lyne, 1964-2001) lost here in 1959 by a distance, future Cabinet minister David Clark (Colne Valley 1970-Feb 1974, South Shields 1979-2001) lost in 1966 by just 647 votes, Michael Noble (Rossendale Oct 1974-1979) saw Cary increase his majority to 3,489 at the 1970 election.

<!-- Mcr Ardwick 1955-83 -->

The transfer of Rusholme into Manchester Ardwick for the 1955 election tilted the constituency towards the political right, and Leslie Lever had to work hard for his re-election that year, but he wasn't seriously challenged after that.  Lever retired in 1970 and successfully passed a safe Labour seat on to journalist and satirist Gerald Kaufman, who wasn't remotely affected by further boundary changes in February 1974 which transferred Levenshulme from Manchester Withington into Manchester Ardwick.

<!-- Mcr Withington 1974-83 -->

Those boundary changes coincided with Sir Robert Cary's retirement as Conservative MP for Withington.  For the February 1974 election the Withington Conservatives selected Fred Silvester who had previous Commons experience: Silvester had won the Walthamstow West by-election in 1967, losing the seat at the following general election in 1970.  Again Withington was a safer berth, particularly with the return of Didsbury in the 1974 boundary changes.  Silvester won by 4,413 votes over Labour in a contest where all three parties polled over 10,000 votes, and was appointed as an opposition whip - in which role he was depicted in James Graham's 2012 play <em>This House</em>.

<!-- Mcr Gorton 1983-2024 -->

Gorton and Denton went through their second divorce at constituency level in 1983, when the parliamentary boundaries caught up with the new English local government structure.  This area was no longer on the edge of Lancashire, hard up against the border with Cheshire and with Stockport county borough which had left Denton in a corner of the map.  Now Denton was part of the Tameside metropolitan borough alongside old Cheshire towns like Hyde, Dukinfield and Stalybridge; and the Denton/Stockport boundary was no longer a county line.  So, when the Boundary Commission found that Stockport and Tameside boroughs had awkwardly-sized populations entitling them to 3½ and 2½ MPs, it was OK to create a constituency crossing their border to give 6 seats to the combined area.  That crossborder seat was called Denton and Reddish, and we shall come to it in a moment.  Meanwhile Gorton was added to the Manchester Ardwick constituency, which needed a new name because Ardwick itself had been transferred into Manchester Central: thus the Manchester Gorton name was retained, even through Denton and Reddish was the true successor of that seat.  These boundaries more or less survived further boundary reviews in 1997 and 2010.

<!-- Mcr Withington 1983-2024 -->

None of this affected Burnage, which remained part of the Manchester Withington constituency all the way through to 2024.  But the 1980s the demographic changes which would transform Withington from a Conservative stronghold into the left-wing urban professional seat we know today were well under way.  Despite the return of Chorlton to the seat at the 1983 redistribution, Fred Silvester might well have lost his seat to Labour that year had it not been for a strong performance by the SDP candidate Bernard Lever, who had name recognition as the son of Leslie Lever.  Lever junior finished third with 26%, Labour's Frances Done was second with 34%, and Silvester was re-elected for his fourth term with 39%.

That was the last hurrah for Conservatism in Withington.  Fred Silvester lost his seat in 1987 to Keith Bradley, who became the first Labour MP for the constituency.  Bradley was a Manchester city councillor and secretary of the Stockport Community Health Council at the time of his first election, which he won by a majority of 3,391.

Ten years later, Keith Bradley's majority was over 19,000 votes and he had made it onto the rungs of the ministerial ladder, peaking as Deputy Chief Whip.  The Conservatives fell to third place behind the Lib Dems in 2001, but a majority of 11,524 for Labour didn't seem cause for concern.

Wrong.  Keith Bradley lost his seat in 2005 to the Liberal Democrats' John Leech on a swing of 17%, the largest swing in any seat that year.  The Labour vote may have been rather unusually split, as Keith Bradley appeared on the ballot paper below the Conservative candidate Karen Bradley (who was later elected as MP for Staffordshire Moorlands, was a cabinet minister throughout the Theresa May administration and now chairs the Commons home affairs select committee).  Leech, who was the deputy leader of the Liberal Democrat group on Manchester city council, won with a majority of 667 votes.  He was re-elected with an increased majority of 1,850 over Labour in the 2010 Withington election, in which all three major party candidates eventually became MPs (the Tories' Chris Green represented Bolton West from 2015 to 2024, while Labour's Lucy Powell won the Manchester Central by-election in 2012 and she is now deputy leader of the Labour Party).

Leech was an opponent of the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition that resulted from the 2010 election, and - not surprisingly given his student-heavy electorate - he voted against increasing tuition fees.  Not that that helped John Leech in the end: the 2015 election saw a swing of 17% against him to restore the <em>status quo ante</em> for Labour.

The Labour MP for Withington since 2015 has been Jeff Smith, who at the time of his election was a Manchester city councillor and former event manager and DJ.  Smith's initial majority was 14,874 votes, and two subsequent attempts by John Leech to get his seat back have seen the Lib Dem vote fall further.  In December 2019 the third round of Smith v Leech finished with a 67-15 win for Jeff Smith, a majority of 27,905 votes.

Meanwhile Manchester Gorton's MP Kenneth Marks retired in 1983, and his seat was taken over by the previous Manchester Ardwick MP Gerald Faufman who leveraged the "longest suicide note in history" into a majority of 9,965 votes in that year.  He was never seriously challenged afterwards.  Kaufman had never risen above junior ministerial level before the Labour defeat in 1979, but he spent the Kinnock years as one of Labour's most senior frontbenchers: he was shadow home secretary in 1983-87, followed by five years as shadow foreign secretary in 1987-92.  In 1992 Kaufman became chair of what we now call the Commons culture, media and sport committee, serving in that role for 13 years.  He was knighted in 2004.  And, following his election in 2015 for his 12th term of office, he became the Father of the House as the first to have been sworn in of four survivors from the 1970 general election.  The other three were Ken Clarke, Michael Meacher - who died later that year - and Dennis Skinner.

Sir Gerald Kaufman died in February 2017 at the age of 86, as the oldest member of the Commons - a title which then went to Skinner, while Clarke took over as Father of the House.  This would have triggered the fourth Manchester Gorton by-election, which was called to take place on 4th May 2017 as the eleventh by-election of the 2015 Parliament.  Eleven candidates were nominated.

Then, on 18th April, the prime minister Theresa May announced that she would seek an early general election to take place on 8th June 2017.  The timings involved meant that by the time the by-election had concluded Parliament had been dissolved, rending the poll a dead letter.  In order to call the poll off the House of Commons had to resolve to ask the Speaker to issue a writ of supersedeas to the returning officer, in line with a precedent from 1923, because there is no statutory way to cancel an election that is already in process.

The nominations from the cancelled Manchester Gorton by-election were not carried forward to the general election, but nine of the eleven candidates from the by-election did stand again including George Galloway, who finished in third place as an independent candidate.  However, the winner with a massive 76% of the vote was Labour's Afzal Khan, who was born in Pakistan and came to the UK at the age of 11.  Khan was a solicitor who had served on Manchester city council from 2000 to 2015, including a year as Lord Mayor in 2004-05, before being elected in 2014 as a Labour MEP for north-west England.  He continued to serve Manchester Gorton until the seat was abolished in 2024, then transferred to the new Manchester Rusholme constituency.

<!-- Denton/Reddish 1983-2024 -->

The final piece of this complicated historical puzzle is the 1983-2024 seat of Denton and Reddish, a safe Labour seat which had only two MPs - both of them called Andrew - in its 41-year history.  The first of these was Andrew Bennett, who had previously represented Reddish as part of the marginal Stockport North constituency for nine years.  He was a definite winner from the 1983 edition of Boundary Commission roulette, taking over a safe seat for as long as he wanted it, and for much of the 1980s he was a Labour frontbencher focusing on education and science.  Boundary changes for the 1997 election, which transferred Brinnington out of the seat and Dukinfield in, made not a jot of difference to his majority. Bennett eventually called time on his parliamentary career at the 2005 election, when he retired after 31 years in office.

When Andrew Bennett started his career on the green benches, his successor hadn't been born. Andrew Gwynne - the son of the late darts commentator John Gwynne - first came to prominence in 1996 when was elected as a Labour councillor for the Denton West ward of Tameside council, aged slightly less than 21 years and 11 months. At the time he was reported to have been the country's youngest councillor, and the council experience must surely have helped with his degree in politics and contemporary history at Salford, from where he graduated in 1998. In 2005 Gwynne became, aged 30, the youngest member of the Labour benches, easily defeating the Conservative candidate and former Olympic rower Alex Story.

Despite his 20 years on the green benches, Gwynne's frontbench career was modest.  His peak position on the greasy pole came in the Corbyn years, when Gwynne spent three years in the Shadow Cabinet with the communities and local government portfolio: he combined that role with serving as the Labour Party's co-national campaign co-ordinator, alongside Ian Lavery, for the 2017 and 2019 general elections.

When Gwynne's Denton and Reddish seat was broken up in 2024 he became the first MP for Gorton and Denton, polling 51% of the vote to 14% for Reform UK and 13% for the Green Party; in integer terms, that gave Gwynne a majority of 13,413 votes over Reform UK.  He immediately joined the government as a junior health minister.

And all was fine until the existence of "Trigger Me Timbers" came to light in February 2025.  This was a bad-taste WhatsApp group in which Gwynne and friends mocked all sorts of targets ranging from their own constituents to the Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner.  It was definitely the sort of behviour whch does not look clever in the cold light of day, and once the Labour Party realised what its members had been doing it suspended all of its elected representatives who were members of the group.  This amounted to Gwynne, nine Tameside councillors (mostly from the three Denton wards, and including Gwynne's wife), two Stockport councillors and former Tameside councillor Oliver Ryan, who had been elected in 2024 as the Labour MP for Burrnley.  Gwynne also lost his job as a junior health minister as a result of all this.

Over the subsequent twelve months all of the Labour councillors and MPs who were suspended over Trigger Me Timbers have since been readmitted to the whip, or quit the party, or (in some cases) both, except for Andrew Gwynne.  After almost a year in the political wilderness Gwynne eventually resigned from the Commons in January on medical advice not to return to work, after reportedly reaching a settlement with the Commons authorities for early retirement which would allow him to claim an ill-health pension straight away.

Andrew Gwynne leaves behind what would be, in normal times, a plum Labour seat which the party should expect to defend without breaking much sweat.  The last non-Labour MP for any part of this seat was the Lib Dems' John Leech who was defeated in 2015; the last Conservative MP for any part of this seat was defeated in 1987; and Gorton itself has an unbroken line of Labour MPs going all the way back to 1935.

The Labour party is similarly dominant in local government.  Manchester city council has had a Labour majority continuously since 1971, Tameside council continuously since 1979.  The Conservatives haven't won any of the wards in this constituency for decades, and until Labour lost Longsight ward to the Worker's Party in 2024 they held a full slate of councillors here.

If we add up the votes cast in May 2024 in the four Manchester wards within this seat and the three Denton wards, we get 54% for Labour, 17% for the Workers Party (nearly all of which came out of Longsight and Levenshulme) and 15% for the Greens.  Labour and the Greens were the only party to stand candidates in all seven wards, and Denton North East was a straight fight between them.

Andrew Gwynne's resignation brought to a head months of tiresome speculation as to whether Andy Burnham, the popular elected mayor of Greater Manchester, would go for the Labour nomination in the resulting by-election.  Burnham did in the end apply for the nomination, but he was rejected by the Labour Party's national executive committee on the grounds that he would have to resign as mayor to seek election as MP: the Greater Manchester mayoralty has police and crime commissioner powers, and MPs can't be PCCs at the same time.  A county-wide mayoral by-election was seen as too much of a risk.

Instead the Labour nomination has gone to Angeliki Stogia, who has been a Manchester city councillor since 2012: she represents Whalley Range ward, which is part of the Rusholme constituency.  Stogia, who was born in Greece and is a naturalised UK citizen, works for the planning consultancy firm Arup: they have seconded her to Network Rail to work on the ongoing Transpennine Route Upgrade.

Second here in July 2024 were Reform UK.  Their candidate is the GB News presenter Matt Goodwin, a former academic who wrote books on the radical right such as the 2015 work <em>Revolt on the Right</em> before joining their ranks himself.

That's not just my assessment.  Goodwin's co-author on <em>Revolt on the Right</em> Rob Ford, who is now a professor at Manchester University, has taken a different professional route by staying in academia to become one of the most respected psephologists working in the UK today.  Ford has his own Substack at swingometer.substack.com which comes strongly recommended, and he has blogged extensively on this by-election - not without consequences for himself, as we shall come to in a moment.  In his initial post on the by-election Ford had this to say on his former colleague:

<blockquote>
As many Swingometer readers will know, Matthew and I have a history - we worked together a lot as young postdoctoral researchers in Manchester, culminating in a well received book on the rise of UKIP - “Revolt on the Right.” More recently, I have criticised Matthew’s misrepresentation of evidence and statistics and his use of irresponsible and polarising rhetoric on difficult issues. I have not worked with him professionally or been in contact with him socially in a long time. While I can’t erase our personal history, I will do my best to assess his candidacy objectively - I leave it to readers to decide whether I am successful.
</blockquote>

Ford goes on to identify one strength of Goodwin as a candidate, namely his high media profile, and two weaknesses: that he is a first-time candidate and that he has, "to put it mildly, a message discipline issue".  But it probably isn't Goodwin's fault that Reform UK sent out thousands of handwritten-style letters to electors, which were credited to a local pensioner but which lacked the required legal imprint showing that they were material from the Goodwin campaign.  The printers have apparently accepted that they were at fault, but Reform UK's election agent - who is legally responsible for this material - would do well to seek legal advice.  If this slipup genuinely wasn't the Reform UK campaign's fault and happened despite their best attempts to prevent it, then the agent would be entitled to apply to the High Court for relief from this breach of electoral law.  This wouldn't come cheap, but it would probably be less expensive and certainly less hassle than being prosecuted.

Third place in Gorton and Denton two years ago went to the Green Party, who have selected Hannah Spencer.as their candidate.  Spencer is the leader of the Green Party group on Trafford council, where she represents Hale Central ward - which is far more middle-class than anything to be found in Gorton and Denton.  By trade she is a plumber and gas engineer.

The Greens clarly fancy their chances in this by-election and they are fighting it hard, with Green stakeboards all over the seat's Manchester wards and Green posters appearing in the windows of many businesses in Levenshulme and Longsight.  So it's a bit of a shame that the Greens' leaflet composers decided that some deeply misleading quotes from Rob Ford's Substack were just the ticket to demonstrate that they were in the race to beat Labour here.  Ford extracted and accepted an apology from the Green campaign for this, and then understandably blew his top when a further Green leaflet subsequently went out with the same out-of-context quotes on it.

Two other parties saved their respective deposits here in 2024.  Fourth place went to the Workers' Party on 10.3%, which led to some speculation as to whether they would field George Galloway or their Longsight councillor Shahbaz Sarwar.  As it turned out, the answer to that question was "neither": there is Worker's Party candidate in this by-election and that 10.3% of the vote is up for grabs.  Fifth here last time were the Conservatives on 7.9%; their candidate Charlotte Cadden comes to politics from a 30-year career as a police officer.  The Liberal Democrats, who finished in sixth and last place in 2024 with a deposit-losing 3.8%, have gone for Jackie Pearcey who has a long history in this seat: Pearcey was a councillor for the former Gorton North ward until the Lib Dems were wiped out of Manchester council in 2012, and she has stood four times for Parliament in the former Manchester Gorton constituency: in 1997, 2001, 2017 and 2019.

Five new candidates have also turned up at the Manchester council electoral office before the deadline and submitted their nomination papers.  Hoping to bring home the electoral bacon is the Monster Raving Loony Party's Sir Oink A Lot, who is described as "the whole hog" and has reportedly had a crackling campaign.  His position at the top of the ballot paper certainly proves that pigs might fly.  Nick Buckley, who was the Reform UK candidate for the 2021 Greater Manchester mayoral election and then finished in third place as an independent candidate for the 2024 mayoral election, has the nomination of Advance UK here: Buckley, who is originally from Longsight, founded a charity for the homeless called the Mancunian Way, and he was appointed MBE in the 2020 New Year Honours for services to young people and to the community in Greater Manchester.  The Libertarian Party have selected Dan Clarke, who was previously the Liberal Party candidate for Runcorn and Helsby in the 2024 general election and the 2025 by-election.  Standing for the Social Democratic Party is Sebastian Moore, who was last seen on a ballot paper in the 2024 general election when he contested Manchester Central.  Rejoin EU's candidate Joseph O'Meachair, who stood in Preston in the 2024 general election, has some experience in answering the hard questions: under the name Joseph Meagher, he was captain of the Manchester University team that won <em>University Challenge</em> in 2006.  And last on the ballot paper is Hugo Wils, who works in an aerospace factory and is the candidate of the Communist League: Wils has four previous candidacies for Manchester or Tameside council under his belt, and he is yet to score 100 votes in total.
