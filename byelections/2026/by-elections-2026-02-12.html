</p><p>
Two by-elections on 12th February 2026:
</p><p>
<h2>Worth Valley</h2>
</p><p>
<em>Bradford council, West Yorkshire; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Russell Brown.</em>
</p><p>
It's not often that this column gets to tie in with a brand-new film.  A new version of <em>Wuthering Heights</em> opens in cinemas tomorrow, featuring Margot Robbie as Catherine Earnshaw, Jacob Elordi as Heathcliff and some gorgeous location shots of the Yorkshire Dales.  I understand that critical opinion on the film has been somewhat divided, but maybe you might like to decide for yourself?
</p><p>

</p><p>
<em>Wuthering Heights</em> was, of course, the only novel by Emily Brontë, one of three literary sisters of the 19th century (along with Anne and Charlotte) who lived for most of their short lives in the Pennine village of Haworth.  And if you ever go to Haworth you will know about that.  The village centre hasn't changed much since the Brontës' day, and its cobbled main street is full of businesses and buildings which extract every possible tourist pound from the most tangential of Brontë connections.  Trying to sell something to a Yorkshireman for a profit is the definition of optimism, but Haworth does seem to have hit on a winning formula here.  The Brontë Parsonage, where the sisters lived, is now a museum; while the grave of Emily and Charlotte can be found in the parish church next door.  (Anne Brontë is buried in Scarborough.)
</p><p>
The Brontë connections extend to the moors above Haworth, with a well-trodden four-mile walk from the village signed in English and Japanese bringing the hiker past the Brontë Waterfall to the remote and ruined farmhouse of Top Withens on the Pennine Way.  Top Withens has long been associated in the popular imagination with Wuthering Heights, although the evidence for this is scanty at best.  As long ago as 1964 the Brontë Society placed a plaque on the ruined building setting things straight:
</p><p>
<blockquote>
This farmhouse has been associated with "Wuthering Heights", the Earnshaw home in Emily Brontë's novel. The buildings, even when complete, bore no resemblance to the house she described, but the situation may have been in her mind when she wrote of the moorland setting of the Heights.
</blockquote>
</p><p>
A walk down to the bottom of Haworth's main street will bring the tourist to the railway station.  This is part of the Keighley and Worth Valley Railway, a preserved line which runs steam and diesel trains between Keighley and Oxenhope via the main settlements in Worth Valley ward.  The railway has been a very popular location for filming over the years, most famously in the 1970 film <em>The Railway Children</em> which made extensive use of Oakworth station.  Oakworth, which is effectively a western suburb of Keighley, is the largest settlement in Worth Valley ward.
</p><p>
<em>The Railway Children</em> featured the railway's chairman Bob Cryer in an uncredited cameo role.  This was before Cryer became the local MP when he gained the Keighley constituency from Labour in 1974; he served that seat until his defeat in 1983, and Cryer was then MP for Bradford South from 1987 until he died in a car crash in 1994.
</p><p>
The Keighley constituency - which was renamed as Keighley and Ilkley in 2024 for no particularly good reason - has always been a closely-fought marginal seat, although it has historically been slightly too Labour-inclined to be a bellwether: Labour won here in 1979 and 2017 despite losing nationally.  Which makes the 2024 general election result in Keighley a seriously impressive achievement for the Conservative MP Robbie Moore, who was re-elected for his second term with almost no swing from 2019: his majority over the seat's former Labour MP John Grogan was 1,625 votes, down from 2,218 five years previously.  Moore was a Northumberland councillor for Alnwick before entering Parliament, and he featured in this column as the Conservative candidate in the July 2019 Northumbria Police and Crime Commissioner by-election; he is now a shadow DEFRA frontbencher.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2024/bradford24s.svgz" alt="Bradford, 2024" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
This result is all the more impressive because Worth Valley was the only one of the six Keighley and Ilkley wards to vote Conservative at the last local elections in May 2024.  On that occasion Ilkley and the commuter villages of Craven ward voted Green, while the three Keighley town wards - which can be politically volatile owing to their large Muslim population - were all won by Labour.  The local authority here is the large Bradford council, where Labour have a small majority following a poor outing in Bradford city in 2024: the latest count has 47 Labour councillors, 15 independents, 12 Conservatives plus this vacancy, 10 Greens and 5 Lib Dems.
</p><p>
Since the current Bradford ward map was adopted in 2004 the Conservatives have carried every election in Worth Valley ward, although one of its seats did go to the British National Party in the 2004 all-out elections.  The Tories haven't been seriously challenged here for a decade or more, and in 2024 ward councillor Russell Brown was re-elected for his fifth and last term of office with a 56-32 lead over Labour.  Brown had been first elected at a November 2010 by-election to replace the previous Conservative councillor Kris Hopkins, who had been elected as Conservative MP for Keighley earlier in the year.
</p><p>
Russell Brown died at the start of November, just before the cutoff date for by-elections to be held in advance of the 2026 Bradford elections - which will see all 90 councillors up for election on a new ward map.  It appears that the Conservatives had no intention of calling a by-election for Brown's seat and they were hoping to leave it vacant until May, but Reform UK have forced their hand and sent in the two letters to the returning officer required to request a poll.
</p><p>
Defending this seat for the Conservatives is Paul Golding, who is a town councillor in Denholme (which will be transferred into this ward in May's boundary changes) and contested Bingley ward in 2024.  It is important to point out that he is <em>not</em> the Paul Golding who is head of the far-right party Britain First; apart from anything else, this Paul Golding is black.  The Labour candidate is Keighley town councillor Peter Kates.  Also standing are Josie McMaster for the Greens, Kay Kirkham for the Lib Dems, left-wing independent candidate Sabine Ebert-Forbes and Reform UK's Andrew Judson, another Keighley town councillor who was their parliamentary candidate here in 2024.  Counting for this by-election will take place on Friday morning.
</p><p>
Before we leave Haworth, a little bit of music is in order.  Here is Gordon Langford's 1979 brass band suite <em>Three Haworth Impressions</em>, which will be the test piece for Third Section brass bands at next month's area championships.  The first movement "Top Withens" is dark and brooding, representing the sinister Heathcliff; the second movement "Three Bells" starts with an Ab, Cb and Eb on tubular bells representing the Brontës' pennames Acton, Currer and Ellis Bell; while the final movement "The Worth Valley Railway" is a celebration of the locals' success in keeping their railway open.  Well worth your time.

<h2>Fletton and Woodston</h2>
</p><p>
Peterborough council, Cambridgeshire; caused by the death of Labour councillor Nick Thulbourn.
</p><p>
Our other poll today is in another ward served by a preserved railway line.  This is the Nene Valley Railway, which runs west from Peterborough up the namesake valley for around 7½ miles.  Its Peterborough terminus lies at the eastern end of this ward.
</p><p>
The Nene was once a county boundary, with the Soke of Peterborough lying to the north of it and Huntingdonshire to the south.  This meant that Fletton, which lies directly to the south of Peterborough city centre over the Nene, was historically in a different county from it.  Woodston lies to the west of Fletton along the Oundle Road.  This was once quite an industrial area, with Fletton having a very large brickworks, but most of the former factory sites have now been redeveloped for housing.  For reasons best known to the Boundary Commission, Fletton and Woodston ward also crosses the Nene to take in the open space of Thorpe Meadows (where Peterborough's rowing lake is located) and a residential area to the west of Peterborough city centre along Thorpe Road; this area has no connection to the rest of the ward.
</p><p>
This latter area forms a salient within the North West Cambridgeshire constituency, which is based on southern and western parts of Peterborough.  This was seen as a safe Conservative constituency when it was created in 1997, and the former Peterborough Conservative MP Brian Mawhinney successfully did the chicken run here on that occasion.  But times have changed since then, and North West Cambridgeshire turned in one of the closest results of the 2024 general election with Labour's Sam Carling, a Cambridge city councillor and postgraduate student, defeating the Conservative MP Shailesh Vara by just 39 votes.  Carling is the Baby of the House, being elected at the age of 22: he is the first MP to be born in the 21st century.
</p><p>
Peterborough city council has been hung since 2019 and its latest composition is a bit messy.  A minority administration of just 13 Labour councillors plus two vacancies is opposed by 12 independent councillors, 10 Conservatives, 10 members of the localist party Peterborough First, 8 Lib Dems and 5 Greens.
</p><p>
The two vacant seats both lie in Fletton and Woodston ward, which has been closely fought between the Conservatives and Labour since its creation in 2016.  The winning councillor here in 2019 was the Conservatives' Louise Coles, sister-in-law of the Revd Richard Coles, who died in the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Her seat was vacant for a year before a by-election could be held, at which point it was gained by Labour; the new Labour councillor then defected to the Greens but lost re-election in 2023 under his new colours.  Louise Coles' husband Andy Coles, who has been the subject of controversy over his previous role as an undercover police officer, then lost his seat to Labour's Daily Blakemore-Creedon in 2024 by a 48-34 margin to give Labour all three seats in the ward.
</p><p>
The other two Labour councillors for Fletton and Woodston ward have both recently died.  First to go was Nick Thulbourn, who had represented this ward from 2012 to 2016 and again from 2023 until his death in December from liver cancer.  He had spent a short period earlier in 2025 as Peterborough's cabinet member for growth and regeneration.  This by-election is to replace him.
</p><p>
Not long after that, political veteran Alan Dowson passed away in January at the age of 87.  Dowson, who was mayor of Peterborough in 2022-23, has continuous service from 2016 but was first elected to the old Peterborough borough council all the way back in 1971.  There are very few councillors left now with service from before the 1974 reorganisation.  Dowson had worked in education after leaving the armed forces, where he was exposed to nuclear weapons tests in Kiritimati in 1957-58.
</p><p>
Alan Dowson died in the last six months of his term, which was due to run until May 2026, so his seat was going to be left vacant until the ordinary elections then.  However, the May 2026 Peterborough elections are no longer happening: Peterborough is one of 30 districts which has recently had its 2026 elections postponed in advance of local government reorganisation.  This is despite the fact that, outside Surrey, there is no plan for local government reorganisation: we have instead a series of vague statements from ministers and much bickering in the marsh among the councillors who have been asked to implement this.  Nobody seems to have questioned whether all this is in the interests of local democracy, or indeed whether the resulting local government model would be financially sustainable.
</p><p>
It is also noticeable that the vast majority of postponements which have been granted are in Labour-run councils, and the minority Labour administration in Peterborough is one of the most precarious of the lot.  Interestingly the final list of postponements did not include Nuneaton and Bedworth, where the Labour council leader was no-confidenced for requesting a postponement against the wishes of the majority of the council.  Anyway, all this means that there will now have to be a further by-election in Fletton and Woodston ward, on or before 7th May, to fill Alan Dowson's seat.
</p><p>
Before then we have today's by-election to fill Nick Thulbourn's seat.  Defending for Labour is Harvey Woodhouse, a caseworker for Sam Carling MP who will not be helped by having "address in Huntingdonshire" next to his name on the ballot paper: Woodhouse was previously a Labour candidate in St Neots in the 2025 Cambridgeshire county elections and a 2024 Huntingdonshire council by-election.  The Conservatives' Andrew Willey, who has stood in this ward three times before without success, submitted nomination papers as an independent before withdrawing then and submitting a second nomination as a Conservative candidate, which probably means that there were issues with the paperwork for him to stand as a Conservative first time round.  Also standing on an all-male ballot paper are former Peterborough Labour councillor Ed Murphy for the Greens, Neil Walton for the Lib Dems and Reform UK candidate Andrew O'Neil, who stood for Cambridgeshire county council last year in Cambridge's Arbury division.
