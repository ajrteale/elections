One by-election on Tuesday 10th February 2026:
</p><p>
<h2>Fishguard: North East</h2>
</p><p>
<em>Pembrokeshire council, Wales; caused by the death of Labour councillor Jordan Ryan.</em>
</p><p>
Last week's edition of Andrew's Previews finished in Wales' main ferry port, with Reform UK gaining a seat from Plaid Cymru in a ward based on southern Holyhead and Holy Island.  Just five days later, we travel to Wales' other major ferry port for another by-election.
</p><p>
The town of Fishguard lies on its namesake bay on the west coast of Wales, and it was originally a small port at the mouth of the Gwaun river - hence its Welsh-language name Abergwaun.  This area now forms Fishguard's Lower Town, and it still has the air of a fishing village.  The Lower Town stood in for Llareggub in the 1972 film of Dylan Thomas' <em>Under Milk Wood</em> which featured Richard Burton, Elizabeth Taylor and Peter O'Toole, while some years earlier scenes from the 1956 film <em>Moby Dick</em> were filmed here.  Fishguard is a Viking name referring literally to a "fish yard" or a place where fish were trapped, and the remains of ancient fish traps here can still be seen at low tide on both banks of the short Gwaun estuary.
</p><p>
Fishguard was once seen as important enough that it was the location of what is sometimes referred to as the last invasion of Britain.  This occurred during the Napoleonic Wars on 22nd February 1797, when around 1,400 French troops successfully landed at Carregwastad Point, around three miles to the north of the town, with the intention of marching on Bristol.  Discipline among the invaders quickly broke down amid resistance from the local population, and two days later their Irish-American commander William Tate surrendered on the beach at Goodwick despite his numerical advantage over the British defenders.  Legend has it that the French were prompted to surrender by mistaking local women in Welsh traditional costume, who had gathered on the clifftop to watch the proceedings, for soldiers in scarlet coats.  The act of surrender was eventually signed in the Royal Oak, a pub in Fishguard town centre which still stands today, after which Tate and his invasion force were taken as prisoners of war.
</p><p>
Modern invaders to Fishguard arrive by ferry, with arrivals and departures every 12 hours or so for the 3½ hour crossing to Rosslare in the Republic of Ireland.  This route is run by Stena Line, but they are one ship short on their Irish Sea routes for the next few months after the <em>Stena Estrid</em> hit the jetty at Holyhead last month and had to be taken out of service for repairs.  Stena Line have had to borrow the older and less well-appointed <em>Ben-my-Chree</em> from the Isle of Man Steam Packet to run the Fishguard-Rosslare route until May, while that route's normal boat the <em>Stena Nordica</em> covers for the absent <em>Estrid</em> on Holyhead-Dublin.
</p><p>
For the moment, the <em>Ben-my-Chree</em> docks twice a day at Fishguard Harbour, which lies on the western side of the bay some distance to the west of Fishguard town; it's actually closer to Goodwick, which shares a town council with Fishguard.  The modern harbour was developed in the early years of the 20th century by the Great Western Railway, which wanted to get a bigger slice of the transatlantic passenger market by attracting the great ocean liners away from their competitors' ports at Liverpool and Southampton.  The time advantage of the London - Fishguard - New York route was such that the Cunard line started to call here, with the RMS <em>Mauretania</em> becoming the first New York liner to visit Fishguard Harbour when it anchored here in August 1909; but problems with silting meant that the big ships could never dock here back in the day.
</p><p>
Fishguard was once one of the towns represented in Parliament in the Haverfordwest District of Boroughs, and its successor the Pembroke and Haverfordwest District of Boroughs.  This was one of a number of pre-1918 Welsh constituencies which grouped together disconnected towns to create an urban constituency.   Appropriately enough, one of the most notorious MPs for the Pembroke and Haverfordwest Boroughs was a shipping magnate.  Owen Philipps, who represented the seat as a Liberal MP from 1906 to December 1910 and later became the first Lord Kylsant, was chairman and chief executive of the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company which, when it took over White Star in 1927, became the largest shipping line in the world.  But its finances were built on sand, and Kylsant had been covering up the Royal Mail line's losses by opaque accounting while continuing to pay dividends to the company's shareholders.  These days we'd call that fraud.  When the Royal Mail line defaulted on a loan repayment in 1928, a government-ordered audit revealed the truth: Kylsnt was prosecuted in 1931 for producing a document with intent to deceive, and he spent ten months in Wormwood Scrubs.
</p><p>
The modern-day MP for Fishguard is Plaid Cymru's Ben Lake, who was first elected in 2017 for the Ceredigion constituency and took Fishguard over in 2024 when his seat was expanded to include northern Pembrokeshire, with the name of Ceredigion Preseli.  For the next three months the old Preseli Pembrokeshire constituency still exists at Senedd level: since 2007 this seat has been represented in Cardiff Bay by Paul Davies, who was leader of the Welsh Conservatives from 2008 to 2021.  The Senedd's electoral reform for May will place Fishguard within the Ceredigion Penfro constituency, which on the votes cast in 2024 would return two MSs each for Plaid Cymru and Labour and one each for the Conservatives and Reform UK; top of the Labour list here in May will be the First Minister, Eluned Morgan.

</p><p>
Those looking for straws in the wind from this by-election may well be confounded - as often happens with Welsh local elections.  Pembrokeshire county council has a long-standing independent majority and a serious problem with uncontested elections.  The 2022 elections returned 35 independent councillors, 11 Conservatives, 10 Labour, 2 Plaid Cymru and 2 Lib Dems, with 25 of the 60 councillors being returned unopposed without having to face the electorate.
</p><p>
Two of the Labour councillors were returned for Fishguard and Goodwick, which is divided into three wards with the slightly eccentric names of Goodwick, Fishguard: North East and Fishguard: North West.  There is no Fishguard: South.  In 2022 Fishguard: North West re-elected its independent councillor without a contest and the other two wards were Labour gains from independent, with North East returning the Labour candidate Jordan Ryan by 59-41 in a straight fight with the Conservatives.
</p><p>
Jordan Ryan was the youngest-ever mayor of Fishguard and Goodwick, being sworn into the civic chair in 2018 when he was 26 years old; he went on to serve two terms as mayor from 2018 to 2020 before his election to the county council in 2022.  In September 2025 he quit the Labour party to become an unaffiliated councillor, citing political differences over Gaza and social security cuts.  The latter issue would have hit particularly hard for Ryan as a severely disabled person: he was born with the genetic condition Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which left him confined to a wheelchair.  Men (this is normally a male condition, because it is linked to a faulty copy of the X chromosome which men only have one copy of) with Duchenne muscular dystrophy have a median life expectancy of between 27 and 31 years; Ryan did better than the average, passing away in November at the age of 34.
</p><p>
The resulting Fishguard: North East by-election will be defended for Labour by Paul Howe, who is the manager of the town's theatre Theatr Gwaun.  The Conservatives have reselected their losing candidate here from 2022 Brian Murphy, a Fishguard and Goodwick town councillor who was also a losing Senedd Cymru candidate for Mid and West Wales in 2021; he will be on the Conservative list for Ceredigion Penfro in May's Senedd elections, although fourth place is probably not high enough to expect a win there.  Also on the ballot are town councillor Caleb Churchill for the Lib Dems, Peter John (who was a losing independent candidate for Goodwick ward in 2022) for Reform UK, the present mayor of Fishguard and Goodwick Billy Shaw for Plaid Cymru, and two independent candidates: Teresa Tannahill is fighting her first election campaign, while Adrian Tyrrell - who is the final town councillor on the ballot - rowed across the Atlantic in 60 days in 2023.  Well, I suppose the ocean liners don't call at Fishguard any more.  This is a Welsh local election, so Votes at 16 apply here.
