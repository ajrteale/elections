29th November 2012 will be the largest remaining electoral test of the year.  As well as three parliamentary by-elections in the safe Labour seats of Croydon North, Middlesbrough and Rotherham, there are three local by-elections.  One is an SNP defence in the Outer Hebrides, while the Liberal Democrats will fancy their chances in both of the polls on the mainland: a Conservative defence in a C/LD marginal in Warwickshire, and a Labour defence in a Lab/LD marginal in south London which is the first subject of this week's column.


EAST WALWORTH, Southwark London borough council, South London; caused by the death of Labour councillor Helen Morrissey.

Running east from the Elephant and Castle junction, East Walworth ward runs along the southern edge of the New Kent and Old Kent Roads as far as Burgess Park.  It includes the notorious Heygate Estate, described as one of the starkest examples of post-war urban decay in Britain.  Southwark council are currently trying to regenerate the area and demolition started on the Heygate Estate last year.  This may have contributed to a fall in the ward's population to 11,557 in the recently-released 2011 Census population figures; the Census was taken in the month that demolition work began.  The 2001 census found a population figure of exactly 12,000, of which 29% were black (and over 20% Black African) and 27% born outside the EU-15.

You might have thought that these demographics would create just another inner London safe Labour ward.  The reason why this is not the case can be summed up in two words: Simon Hughes.  East Walworth ward is part of Hughes' constituency of Bermondsey and Old Southwark, and the Lib Dem machine which keeps re-electing him hasn't seized up yet.  While East Walworth is arguably the most Labour-inclined ward in that constituency - it was the only ward in the seat where Labour topped the poll at the 2006 Southwark borough elections - it elected three Liberal Democrat councillors in 2002 and the Lib Dems held the ward in a February 2004 by-election.  Labour gained two seats in 2006 and got a clean sweep of the ward's three seats in 2010, on the same day Hughes was re-elected, but the 2010 result was a close-run thing with the third Labour candidate just 103 votes ahead of the leading Lib Dem.  The most recent electoral test here was the 2012 GLA election in which the Lib Dems had one of their best results in London here, holding second place with 14% of the vote (to 55% for Labour; Ken beat Boris here 57-23).

So, an interesting by-election is in prospect which is contested only by the three main parties.  The defending Labour candidate is Rebecca Lury, a 25-year-old PR worker.  Her main challenge will come from the top Lib Dem candidate in 2010, biologist Dr Ben Johnson who at 31 is the oldest of the three candidates.  Rounding off the ballot paper is 29-year-old Conservative candidate Stuart Millson from East Dulwich.  Southwark Talking News has sent a questionnaire to all the candidates and has put recordings of the results on the internet; see the links below.  All three candidates are on Twitter; in alphabetical order they are @drbenjohnson, @rebeccalury and @Stuart_Millson.

SGIR' UIGE AGUS CEANN A TUATH NAN LOCH, Comhairle nan Eilean Siar; caused by the death of Scottish National Party councillor Bill Houston at the age of 60.  Twice an SNP parliamentary candidate (in Stirling in 1983 and Falkirk in 1992), he had worked for the council for fourteen years before his election in 2012.

Now here's a complete contrast, as this column moves from the bustle and decay of inner-city London to the wide open spaces of the Outer Hebrides.  The ward name Sgir' Uige agus Ceann a Tuath nan Loch and the council Comhairle nan Eilean Siar are mouthfuls in a language which may not be familiar to many readers of the column.  The language is Scottish Gaelic; the council is the Western Isles; and the ward name roughly translates as Uig and North Lochs, covering a large swathe of the southern part of the Isle of Lewis.

Uig is a Viking name (from the Norse word "vik" meaning "bay") and much of the Outer Hebrides were under Norwegian control.  One result of this is perhaps Lewis' most famous export, the Lewis Chessmen, a set of 12th-century ivory chess pieces which were found in a sandback on Uig in the nineteenth century.  Most of these are now on display in the British Museum.  Last year Uig started exporting whisky from the recently-established Abhainn Dearg distillery.

Further to the east is the island of Great Bernera and the villages of Breasclete and Carloway on the eastern shore of Loch Rog.  The ward then moves inland into the low-lying North Lochs district, so-named because of the number of small lochs in the area, and comes out on the east coast of Lewis at Loch Eireasort.  Here can be found the village of Balallan on the main Lewis-Harris road.

Western Isles politics is of course dominated by independents, and previous election results in this ward are even more confusing to interpret because of the number of candidates called Macdonald (which is apparently the most common surname on Great Bernera).  In 2007 four of the six candidates were called Macdonald and three of those were elected: the SNP's Annie Macdonald topped the poll and was elected on first preferences, her surplus elected independent Alex Macdonald, while Labour's Norman Alexander Macdonald fought off the other three independents to narrowly win the final seat.  Before the introduction of PR in 2007 Annie Macdonald had represented Lochs ward (which covered Balallan and the Park area) and Norman Alexander Macdonald had been councillor for Uig ward.

Fast forward to 2012 and Alex Macdonald has stood down while Labour's Norman Alexander Macdonald is standing for re-election as an independent.  He is not to be confused with another 2012 independent candidate, Norman "Puss" Macdonald.  The SNP ran two candidates, Annie Macdonald and Bill Houston; although Annie was the sitting councillor Houston emerged as by far the stronger of the two, and was the first candidate to reach quota after Annie was eliminated.  Houston's surplus re-elected Norman Alexander, who had topped the poll, and gave the final seat to a new independent candidate, Cudig MacLeod.  The three councillors gave a good geographical spread across this huge ward, with Houston from Liurbost (a village in North Lochs), Norman Alexander Macdonald in Uig and MacLeod living in Callanish (a hamlet near Breasclete, known for its standing stones), and polling district data indicates that each candidate polled best in their home area.

The defending SNP candidate will not have such home advantage in this by-election, although he is described as having strong family ties with Lochs and Great Bernera; he is yet another Macdonald, this time John Norman Macdonald, who lives on the Eye Peninsula east of Stornoway and polled poorly in his home ward (Sgire an Rubha) in May.  He is opposed by two new independent candidates, both of whom live in Balallan: Les Mac an Ultaigh, a tour guide, and Angus Morrison, who is described as a former newspaper boss.

SHIPSTON, Stratford-on-Avon district council, Warwickshire; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Jon Gullis to take up a new job in London.  The youngest member of the council, elected eighteen months ago at the age of 21, his resignation came three hours too late for the by-election to be combined with the Warwickshire Police and Crime Commissioner election.  Gullis had refused to hand in resignation until a replacement candidate was selected, but the local Conservatives had been unwilling to select a replacement candidate before Gullis resigned.

This column finishes for the week in the English Midlands and the southernmost town in Warwickshire.  Shipston-on-Stour can be found ten miles south of Stratford-upon-Avon on the road to Oxford.  A prosperous market town in medieval times, the "Ship" of the name refers to sheep which, along with coaching inns, formed much of the local economy.

Shipston ward has the same boundaries as Shipston-on-Stour town council.  For the last decade it has consistently been a Liberal Democrat/Conservative marginal; the two seats split C/LD when the current boundaries were introduced in 2002, but since then the Conservatives have only won the ward in 2004 and 2011.  There have been some very close results over the years (Lib Dem majority of 51 in 2007, Lib Dem majority of 13 in 2008, Conservative majority of 17 in 2011).  The May result in the ward was rather atypical, with the Conservative vote more than halving and the Labour vote almost doubling so that Labour finished second, the Liberal Democrat councillor (who is currently group leader) convincingly holding his seat.  It appears that there was a major controversy in the town over a supermarket development which the Labour candidate supported.

Defending a 17-vote majority and having finished third in the previous election is not where the Conservatives will have wanted to be leading up to this by-election.  Their candidate is Marion Lowe, the Shipston town crier.  The Liberal Democrat candidate is Laura Nelson, who fought Aston Cantlow ward in May.  Completing the ballot paper, Labour's Jeff Kenner will hope to build on his good performance in May; he has apparently been endorsed by outgoing councillor Gullis.
