Starting with something a little bit different this week:

PAGFORD, Pagford town council; caused by the death of Barry Fairbrother who was aged in his early forties.

It's not often that parish-level elections get covered in this column, but this is a bit of an exception.  We travel to the small town of Pagford, a bit of a beauty spot by all accounts with its cobbled market square and ancient abbey.  However, touristy facades like that often hide a fair amont of grottiness and discord behind them.

I haven't been able to find a list of candidates, but by all accounts the campaign has been a cracker, "fraught with passion, duplicity and unexpected revelations" according to one report.  No-one has any idea what to expect when the votes come out of the ballot boxes.

The result?  Well, this is a work of fiction; to find it out you'll have to read the first adult novel by Harry Potter authoress JK Rowling.  Following the Pagford parish council by-election, "The Casual Vacancy" is out today in all good bookshops.

The Casual Vacancy's publication date coincides with polling day for eight real-life casual vacancies; two weeks' worth of by-elections as there are no polls next week.  This is probably the biggest night for local by-elections before the Police and Crime Commissioner elections in mid-November, which many local by-elections will be timed to coincide with.  All this week's contests are Conservative defences except for a seat in Middlesbrough which Labour are defending.


CLENCHWARTON AND KING'S LYNN SOUTH, Norfolk county council; and SPELLOWFIELDS, King's Lynn and West Norfolk district council; both caused by the death of Conservative councillor David Harwood, who was cabinet member for adult social services on the county council.

The county division and district ward cover adjoining but different areas.  The Spellowfields district ward is on the coast and Lincolnshire border west of King's Lynn, and consists of the large village of Terrington St Clement (whch claims to be the largest village in Norfolk) and the smaller village of Tilney All Saints.  The Clenchwarton and King's Lynn South ward, as the name suggests, consists of the Clenchwarton district ward (a village just west of King's Lynn) and the South and West Lynn district ward, which combines the village of West Lynn on the west bank of the Great Ouse with the southern end of King's Lynn, which appears from the map to be a heavily industrial area (including the recently-mothballed King's Lynn Power Station); the division also crosses into West Winch ward to include the village of the same name on the A10 road to London.

Spellowfields district ward is normally safely Conservative (they were opposed in 2007 only by UKIP) but the Tories were pushed all the way in last year's election by a slate of independent candidates; while Harwood had a personal vote his running-mate had a majority of just six votes.  

The county division was a very close three-way fight in 2005, with the Liberal Democrats defeating the Conservatives by just 13 votes and Labour by just 150 votes; the Conservatives gained the division in 2009 but failed to break 40% of the vote and there was a substantial score for the BNP who finished in third place.  In 2007 the Conservatives won all five district council seats in the wards covered by the division, but this score fell to two last year as Labour gained South and West Lynn and an Independent won one of the two seats in West Winch ward (some of which is outside the county division).

Politics in King's Lynn at the moment appears to be dominated by a single issue - a proposed incinerator to be built within the Clenchwarton and King's Lynn South county division which has attracted an impressive level of opposition.  Norfolk County Council have given the incinerator planning permission, but the application was called-in last month by Eric Pickles, the Secretary of State.  I'm not aware that it has got any further.

This issue adds extra spice to the county council by-election, in which the defending Conservative candidate, West Winch district councillor Paul Foster, has incurred the wrath of the anti-incinerator campaign KLWIN, who apparently got a 92% vote against the incinerator in a recent local referendum and should therefore be taken seriously.  KLWIN are calling for voters to defeat Foster.  Kate Sayer, who fought Dersingham ward in the last district election and lives in Hillington, north-east of King's Lynn, is the Liberal Democrat candidate, Alexandra Kemp, who gives an address in Ashwicken, east of Lynn, is running for Labour, and the ballot paper is completed by King's Lynn-based UKIP candidate Michael Stone.  Independent candidate Richard Burton, who was to run on an anti-incinerator ticket, was nominated but has withdrawn after receiving legal advice that his nomination may be invalid.  He will not appear on the ballot paper.

In Spellowfields ward the Conservatives are running Sheila Young who is the only candidate to live in the ward; the other four candidates all give addresses in King's Lynn.  The Independent candidates from last year are not trying again.  Labour have selected Ken Hubbard, and three defeated candidates from King's Lynn wards last year are trying their luck in the by-election; in alphabetical order they are Robert Archer from the Green Party, Michael Stone again from UKIP and Ian Swinton from the Lib Dems.

CASTLE, Dartford district council, Kent; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Sheila East.

There are lots of Castle wards all over the country.  This one is named after Stone Castle, which overlooks the Bluewater Shopping Centre just outside Dartford.  The castle is at the northern end of the ward, which runs north down to the North Kent railway line.  Much of the ward has been redeveloped into housing estates in the last decade, and consequently the ward has seen strong population growth - the electorate has grown from around 1000 in 2003 to nearly 1900 in May last year.

This is Dartford's only single-member electoral ward, and it was very close at its first election, the Conservatives defeating the Liberal Democrats by just three votes - the closest the Lib Dems have ever come to winning a seat on Dartford council.  Since then the Conservatives have not been seriously challenged here.  The Swanscombe and Greenhithe Residents Association put up a candidate here last year; while the ward is not part of either Swanscombe or Greenhithe it is part of the Kent county council division which covers both towns.

For the Conservatives, Stone parish councillor Paul Cutler is defending.  Labour have selected 24-year-old Dartford resident Hayley Reece, while the Swanscombe and Greenhithe Residents Association have nominated Vic Openshaw.  Dartford has a very active English Democrats branch who have reselected Frances Moore to fight the by-election; she may be fishing for votes in the same pool as UKIP candidate Stephen Wilders.

CHERTSEY MEADS and NEW HAW, Runnymede borough council, Surrey; caused by the deaths of Conservative councillors Diana Cotty and Chris Knight respectively.

"Come now towards Chertsey with your holy load."
- William Shakespeare, Richard III, Act I, Scene 2

Two wards in the Runnymede district, an area of affluent outer London suburbia straddling the Surrey section of the M25 motorway.  

Chertsey Meads ward is the eastern of the two wards covering the town of Chertsey, an ancient town thanks to the now-disappeared Chertsey Abbey, founded in AD 666 and at its peak one of the largest Benedictine abbeys in England.  King Henry VI was originally buried at the Abbey in 1471 (his remains are now in St George's Chapel, Windsor).  The town has made a good recovery from being destroyed by Martian fighting machines in HG Wells' War of the Worlds and is now an affluent London commuter area; although its rail link to Waterloo is rather slow and indirect it makes up for this by having easy access to the M25.

On the other side of the town of Addlestone is New Haw, a small village on the Wey Navigation which has now merged seamlessly with the village of Woodham on the other side of the M25.  New Haw has a better rail connection, with Byfleet and New Haw station on the South Western main line (half-hourly trains to Woking and Waterloo) to the south of the village.

Chertsey is a bit different from the rest of Surrey electorally in that it had a Labour county councillor until 2009, although the Meads ward has never elected anything other than Conservatives since 2002.  Of the nine contests since 2012, five of them have seen perennial UKIP candidate Chris Browne fill the runner-up spot; and the most recent contest was also the closest, the Tory majority over UKIP falling to 343 votes.

New Haw is much more of a Tory stronghold with no challenger anywhere near, although there was again a sharp swing away from the Conservatives this year.  The Conservative vote in this ward peaked in 2006 at 79.4%.  After some years of straight Tory/Lib Dem fights, Labour started contesting the ward again in 2011 and have held the runner-up spot since then.

Overall, these by-elections should be boring Conservative holds.  In Chertsey Meads the new Conservative candidate is Peter Boast, who received the British Empire Medal in this year's Birthday Honours list for his community involvement; among other things, he is president of Chertsey cricket club.  He is opposed by Chris Browne for UKIP, fighting this ward for the ninth time; Doug Scott for Labour, who has stood here in the last two elections; and new Liberal Democrat candidate Andy Watson, who stood in May in Englefield Green East ward.  Proceedings will be enlivened by the Official Monster Raving Loony Party candidate Keith Collett, standing under the pseudonym Crazy Crab; he fought the neighbouring Addlestone North ward in May and was one vote away from reaching three figures.

The New Haw contest is a four-sided one, with consultant Mark Maddox leading the defending Conservative charge.  The Labour candidate David Bell tries again.  Graham Wood, who stood in May in Foxhills ward, is the UKIP candidate, while the Lib Dems have reselected their perennial candidate Jennifer Coulon, who is standing here for the eighth time.

HAMPSTEAD TOWN, Camden borough council, North London; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Kirsty Roberts, who is relocating to the USA.

One of the more famous districts of London, Hampstead first developed in the seventeenth century thanks to Hampstead Wells, a spa.  As well as the waters, Hampstead's height and relatively clean air made it attractive to well-off Londoners looking to escape the smog (there is still a part of Hampstead Heath known as the Vale of Health), and the opening of the Golders Green branch of the Northern Line in 1907 helped to connect the area directly with central London.  Because of the height of the hill, Hampstead tube station is the deepest station on the London Underground network, with the main access to the platforms via a 181-foot lift shaft.  Notable buildings in the ward include the Royal Free Hospital and the 17th-century National Trust property Fenton House.  (Jesus Christ, that dog gets everywhere.)

Hampstead is well known for what is mockingly called "Hampstead Liberalism" thanks to its left-leaning intellectual population.  In recent years this hasn't necessarily translated into Liberalism at the ballot box, with Hampstead Town ward having had at least two Conservative councillors continuously from the 2002 election until Roberts' resignation.  The third seat in the ward went Liberal Democrat in 2002, was gained by the Conservatives in 2006 but the Lib Dems got it back at a by-election in September 2008.  At the GLA elections in May Boris beat Ken here 55-26 and the Conservatives beat Labour in the London list vote 40-27, with 16% for the Green Party and 11% for the Liberal Democrats; this was one of just seven wards in Barnet and Camden to vote for the controversial Conservative GLA member Brian Coleman.

The Conservatives have selected Simon Marcus, the founder of the Boxing Academy, a successful North London school for excluded teenagers; he was the parliamentary candidate for Barking in 2010 and beat Nick Griffin into third place.  The Liberal Democrats have called for Jeffrey Fine, a former Harley Street doctor specialising in diet and obesity.  An interesting fight is in prospect.  Also on the ballot paper are Maddy Raman for Labour and Sophie Dix, an actress, for the Green Party.  All the candidates give addresses in the NW3 (Hampstead) postal district.

NORTH ORMESBY AND BRAMBLES FARM, Middlesbrough borough council; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Eleanor Lancaster for health reasons.

A very depressed part of a very depressed town, North Ormesby started off as a Victorian new town, much of which was built by the Pennyman family of Ormesby Hall, after which North Ormesby is named.  Further to the east on the border with Redcar, Brambles Farm is a housing estate of more modern vintage.  Today the area adds up to the one of the most deprived parts of England, with all four of the ward's census areas being in the 10% most deprived in England, and one of the North Ormesby census areas being in the 2% most deprived in England.  The main response to this has been depopulation, with much of the original housing having been demolished.

This is not a ward where Labour are seriously challenged, with the two Labour councillors opposed by just one Conservative candidate at the 2011 borough elections.  The BNP ran second here at a by-election in May 2009.

Labour have selected for the by-election Derek Loughborough, who was a senior union official at the Corus steelworks in Redcar until its closure in 2010; he fought Park End ward in 2011.  He is opposed by Val Beadnall for the Conservatives, Martin Brown for the Liberal Democrats and independent candidates Daud Bashir and Stephen Riley; all of those candidates, with the exception of Riley, stood in the 2011 borough elections.

PASTURES, Blaby district council, Leicestershire; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Ted Webster-Williams, who is moving to Norfolk.

The Pastures ward covers the continuously built-up area between the villages of Narborough and Enderby, south-west of Leicester.  The Narborough section is the Pastures estate after which the ward is named, while the Enderby section is more Victorian housing stock.

This is one of the least-deprived areas of the country thanks to a number of major employers being located in the area; top of that list is the bank Santander UK, whose base at Carlton Park, located within the ward, was formerly the head office of Alliance and Leicester.

Pastures ward was Conservative unopposed in 2007; Labour contested the ward at the last district election in 2011 but made little impression.

Like the last district election, this by-election is a straight C/Lab fight.  Both candidates live in Narborough; the defending Tory candidate Michael Potter performed poorly in a recent by-election in Braunstone Town but should find this area more fruitful for him, while Ann Malthouse was the top Labour candidate here in 2011.

I am grateful to Paul Ward, the Conservative election agent, for help with this preview.
