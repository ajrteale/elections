BETTWS, Bridgend, Glamorgan; caused by the death of long-serving Labour councillor Christopher Michaelides at the age of 75.  A former driving instructor and school governor born to a Cypriot father and Welsh mother, he had been Mayor of Bridgend until May.

One of the more remote villages in Glamorgan, Bettws is located about five miles north of Bridgend on a hill between the Llynfi and Garw valleys.  Like much of the area, Bettws was once a mining village; now farming and tourism are the main contributors to the local economy.

Bettws ward had elected Christopher Michaelides to the council since the creation of Bridgend County Borough Council in 1996.  In later years his seat was not seriously contested, and at Michaelides' final re-election in May this year his only opposition came from the Green Party.

The Labour defence is headed by their candidate Martyn Jones, who lives down the hill in the village of Coytrahen, on the Llynfi.  The Green candidate from May, 'local boy' Gareth Harris, is trying again, and there are two new candidates; the Conservatives are having a crack at this ward for the first time in many years with Bridgend town councillor Matthew Voisey, and Bettws-based Catherine Jones is standing as an independent.
