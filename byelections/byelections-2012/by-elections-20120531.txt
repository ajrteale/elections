'Before the Roman came to Rye or out to Severn strode,
The rolling English drunkard made the rolling English road.
A reeling road, a rolling road, that rambles round the shire,
And after him the parson ran, the sexton and the squire;
A merry road, a mazy road, and as such we did tread
The night we went to Birmingham by way of Beachy Head.'
 - G K Chesterton, The Rolling English Road

This post will be a rolling ramble around England to describe the five by-elections on 31st May.  Like the poem, we start off with a Roman connection in Gloucestershire's Fosseridge ward; wend our merry way to seats in Barnet and Bournemouth recently vacated by former council leaders; and we finish by going by way of Beachy Head, not to Birmingham, but to Scunthorpe.  The Scunthorpe vacancy is a Labour defence while the Conservatives are trying to hold the other four by-elections.


FOSSERIDGE, Cotswold district council, Gloucestershire; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Michele Jeffrey, who is moving to Nottingham to become a trainee barrister.

Fosseridge is the only rural ward in this week's selection, and it has a rather curious shape, surrounding the Cotswold town of Moreton-in-Marsh on three sides.  The ward runs from Broadwell in the south through Bourton-on-the-Hill to the west around to Todenham in the north-east, and includes five other parishes in between (Donnington, Longborough, Condicote, Sezincote and Batsford).  The A429 Fosse Way, the old Roman road from Exeter to Lincoln, cuts the ward into three parts and gives its name to the ward.

This ward is a very safe Conservative area in a safe Conservative Parliamentary constituency, although it has elected three different councillors in the last three elections.  The ward was left uncontested in 2003 and 2007, and in 2011 the Conservatives beat the Lib Dems by an embarassment.

The by-election has attracted three candidates.  Julian Beale, about whom I have no information, is the Conservative candidate; he faces opposition from 20-year-old Liberal Democrat candidate Danny Loveridge and independent candidate Chris Turner, who fought the neighbouring Beacon-Stow ward last year.

BRUNSWICK PARK, London Borough of Barnet; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Lynne Hillan at the age of 63.  A founder-director of a marketing company, Hillan served as Leader of the Council from 2009 to 2011, creating headlines with the controversial One Barnet programme under which many council services were outsourced in a similar way to budget airlines' cheap and cheerful ethos, leading to the project being nicknamed 'easyCouncil'.

The Brunswick Park ward is the most easterly in Barnet, hard up against the border with Enfield and lying on the eastern side of the East Coast Main Line which is the ward's western boundary.  It's a generally middle-class area centred on the New Southgate Cemetery.  There are no railway or Underground stations within the ward but the East Coast Main Line stations of New Southgate and Oakleigh Park (three trains per hour to Moorgate) are close to the western end of the ward, while the eastern end is served by the Underground stations at Arnos Grove and Southgate on the Piccadilly Line.  The ward is split between the N14 (Southgate) and N11 (New Southgate) postal districts.

In the last three Barnet council elections this was a safe Conservative ward and it forms part of a safe Conservative parliamentary constituency (Chipping Barnet).  The ward, of course, voted in the Greater London Assembly election just four weeks ago and the breakdown of the votes from this ward is interesting; Brunswick Park voted heavily for Boris for Mayor (Boris 51.4% Ken 33.5%) but the GLA list vote was close between the two main parties (C 37.4% Lab 35.9%) and Labour actually carried the ward in the poll for the Barnet and Camden constituency (Lab 40.9% C 34.3%).  The reason for this last result would appear to be that the defending Conservative candidate for the GLA constituency was Brian Coleman who had become very unpopular after being involved in a series of controversies, not least spending thousands of pounds of GLA expenses on taxi fares.

The by-election is a fight between just the three main parties.  The Conservative defence is led by Southgate resident Shaheen Mahmood, executive secretary of the Conservative Muslim Forum; her main challenge will come from the Hendon-based Labour candidate Andreas Ioannidis, who runs a small catering business in Central London and has had much favourable publicity in London's Greek Cypriot newspapers.  The ballot paper is completed by Liberal Democrat candidate Yahaya Kiingi, from Edgware.

REDHILL AND NORTHBOURNE, Bournemouth council; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Peter Charon, apparently for business reasons and family commitments.  He had been leader of the council until January this year when he was deposed by the Conservative group.

The Redhill and Northbourne ward covers a residential tract on the northern edge of the South Coast resort of Bournemouth.  It runs to the west of Redhill Park and to the south of the Stour Valley.  (As you might guess from this description, I know nothing whatsoever about Bournemouth.)

This ward covers some of Bournemouth's least deprived areas, but that demographic makeup didn't translate to a safe Conservative ward for the council leader.  Redhill and Northbourne returned three Lib Dem councillors in 2003 before Peter Charon gained a seat in 2007 and split the three seats 2LD/1C.  The three councillors were re-elected last year with Charon topping the poll; for some reason there were only two Liberal Democrat candidates last year for the three seats.  Since then Sue Levell, one of the ward's Lib Dem councillors, has gone Independent.

For some reason this by-election has attracted an enormous field, with nine candidates on the ballot paper.  The Conservative candidate is letting agency manager David d'Orton-Gibson, who fought this ward unsuccessfully last year.  The Liberal Democrats have selected Pat Lewis, who lost her council seat last year in the neighbouring Kinson North ward; confusingly another Lib Dem councillor who lost her seat in Kinson North last year, Claire Smith, is standing as an independent with Cllr Levell's endorsement.  The Labour candidate is Jo Kennedy, who fought this ward as an Independent last year and had a very good result, finishing sixth not far short of d'Orton-Gibson; she runs a local hairdressing salon.  Also on the ballot paper are Sandra Hale of the Green Party, Colin Smith of the BNP and independent candidates Paul Graham and Peter Woodley.  There was going to be a tenth candidate, Steve Bartlett, who was nominated as an independent candidate, but he withdrew before the deadline.

MEADS, Eastbourne borough council, East Sussex; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Nigel Goodyear who wants to stand as an independent for the post of Sussex Police and Crime Commissioner.

Meads ward has a reputation for being the smart end of the seaside resort of Eastbourne.  Much of it was developed in the Victorian era by the Duke of Devonshire, who owned the land, at the same time as the rest of the resort was being developed; with the Victorian hotels and bandstand along the seafront, the shoreline of the ward is probably little changed visually since then.  The ward covers the southern end of town and its population is hemmed into the eastern corner of the ward by the steep South Downs, which terminate here in the chalk cliffs of Beachy Head, allegedly the world's third most popular suicide spot.  Since 2011 the ward has been the eastern end of the South Downs National Park.

Eastbourne council has been closely fought between the Lib Dems and Conservatives for many years, with the Lib Dems most recently holding the upper hand having gained the parliamentary seat in 2010 and holding their majority on the council last year.  Meads ward is the strongest of the borough's nine wards for the Conservatives and is not normally seriously contested by the Lib Dems.

The defending Conservative candidate is school inspector Caroline Ansell who fought the borough's Hampden Park ward last year.  She faces opposition from Lib Dem candidate Gerard Thompson, Labour candidate Dennis Scard (who fought this ward last year), UKIP candidate Ian Cameron (who also fought this ward last year) and Independent candidate Keith Gell, who last year was an also-ran in the borough's Devonshire ward.

TOWN, North Lincolnshire council; caused by the death of Labour councillor Darrell Barkworth who had been a councillor for 21 years, initially on Humberside County Council, and had served as Mayor of North Lincolnshire.

Scunthorpe, the town which fails to pass the spam filter, is like Eastbourne a town almost entirely developed in the Victorian era.  But that's where the similarity ends, as Scunthorpe is a heavily industrial town whose economy is still based on steel, with Tata Industries running an enormous steelworks in the town; other industries in the town include distribution and food production.

The Town ward is a section through the town from west to east with the ward's southern boundary being the railway line.  The ward includes the town centre, the bus station and the railway station (hourly trains east to Grimsby and Cleethorpes, two trains per hour west to Doncaster and Sheffield).  Apart from the western end of the ward around the Kingsway Golf Course this is a very deprived area, with three of the ward's five census areas being in the most deprived 20% in England.  The ward has a relatively high ethnic minority population for Lincolnshire, with 11% of the population identifying themselves as Muslim and 8% as Bangladeshi in the 2001 census.

North Lincolnshire district as a whole includes just a large enough rural area to produce interesting battles for council control, although the Conservative margin of victory in the 2003 election will never be surpassed for closeness: the council split C 22 Lab 21 and that 22nd Conservative seat was won by one vote.  Since then the council has swung against the national tide, with a Labour gain in 2007 and a Conservative gain last year; this was the only council gained by the Conservatives last year, a result which might have been something to do with the scandal which ended the political career of Scunthorpe's former Labour MP Elliot Morley, who pleaded guilty to false accounting just before the 2011 election.  Town ward is safe Labour but the majority has ebbed and flowed in tandem with those results, and last year the Labour majority fell from 32 points to 12 points.

The defending Labour candidate for the by-election is Haque Kataria, who last year fought the hopeless ward of Axholme South.  Abdul Wadud is the Conservative candidate, and the only other candidate standing is Douglas Ward who has the BNP nomination.
