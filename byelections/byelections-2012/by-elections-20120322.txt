It's all Southern England in an interesting set of four by-elections on Thursday.  The Lib Dems have a difficult defence from Labour in north-west London; there is a contest on the Essex seafront with a Residents Association defending; and the Conservatives are hoping to hold onto a Hertfordshire county seat where Labour will fancy their chances, and a very marginal ward in Devon where their councillor has resigned under rather a cloud.

DOLLIS HILL, Brent borough council, North London; caused by the death of Liberal Democrat councillor Dr Alec Castle.  Dr Castle, a former lecturer, was 66 years old; he had served as a Labour councillor in Brent from 1998 to 2002 and as a Liberal Democrat councillor since 2006.

A working-class tract of north-west London, Dollis Hill can be found to the south-west of the M1 terminus at Staples Corner, the ward being located south-west of the A5 and generally south-east of the A406 North Circular Road.  The ward has an interesting social makeup: the 2001 census found a White British population of just 25%, with Indians (16%) and Irish (13%) as the next-most-populous ethnic groups and about one-sixth of the population identifying themselves as black.  17% of the population gave their religion as Muslim and 15% as Hindu.  The entire ward is placed in the worse-off half of the deprivation indices.

The area is named after the Dollis Hill Estate, created in the early nineteenth century by the Finch family buying up several farms in the area and building Dollis Hill House, which in late Victorian times became the home of Lord Aberdeen and a haunt of famous people including Mark Twain and William Gladstone.  Lord Aberdeen moved out in 1897 after being appointed Governor-General of Canada, and the estate was then sold to Willesden urban district council who turned the land into Gladstone Park.  Unfortunately Dollis Hill House was demolished earlier this year after being severely damaged by fire in the 1990s.

The ward named after the estate (which confusingly does not include the Dollis Hill underground station) appears to be very politically volatile.  As recently as 2002 it was a safe Labour ward, with Labour polling 50% to 34% for the Conservatives and 9% for the Lib Dems.  Then in 2003 came along an event since which politics in the area has never been the same - the Brent East by-election which resulted in a Lib Dem gain from Labour by Sarah Teather.  At the time Dollis Hill ward was the northern end of the Brent East constituency (which was abolished in 2010).  The Lib Dems followed up in the 2006 Brent Council elections by gaining one of the three seats in the ward from Labour, and in 2010 the Lib Dems gained the other two seats to make it three out of three, although the ward remained marginal (the Lib Dem majorities were 108, 79 and 27 votes) - this at an election in which Labour regained overall control of Brent council.

This ward is still part of Sarah Teather's constituency (now Brent Central) and the by-election here will be the first post-Coalition test of the formidable Brent Lib Dem campaigning machine.  Given this and the fact that Ken Livingstone lives in the neighbouring Mapesbury ward, the 2008 GLA results are perhaps less useful here than they are in other parts of London; Ken beat Boris here by 49% to 29%, while the Conservatives narrowly beat the Lib Dems into third place (interestingly, Respect were best of the rest).

With the marginal nature of the ward much will depend on the candidates.  The defending Lib Dem candidate Alison Hopkins, described as 'local through and through' having lived in the area for 55 years, is campaigning against cuts to Brent council's library service and plans by neighbouring Barnet council to build a rubbish dump just outside the ward boundary.  For Labour, Parvez Ahmed, who owns a Bangladeshi restaurant in Kilburn, wants the speed limit reduced in residential streets.  Samer Ahmedali is the Conservative candidate; he lives in Harrow and is a manager at a Wembley supermarket.  The ballot paper is rounded off by retired college lecturer Pete Murry, standing for the Green Party.

ST BARTHOLOMEWS, Tendring district council, Essex; caused by the death of Holland-on-Sea Residents Association councillor Mary Bragg at the age of 76.

Another of those cases where ward and, in this case, district names are not very helpful.  The Tendring local government district is the north-eastern corner of Essex, basically everything beyond Colchester, with the seaside resort of Clacton-on-Sea and the port of Harwich being its largest towns.  St Bartholomews ward (named after a local church) covers the western part of Holland-on-Sea, an eastern suburb of Clacton.  

This ward is coastal retiree territory, with the 2001 census finding that the population of the ward had a median age of 61 (the median age of England as a whole is 37); perhaps because of this the ward is one of the better-off parts of Clacton according to the deprivation indices.  Not quite 'Frinton for the incontinent' as a famous Liverpool Street station graffito had it, but not far off either geographically or demographically.

Tendring local politics is rather weird, in that much of the opposition to the Conservative group (who gained overall control last year) comes from local residents' groups.  The residents fell back overall last year and Labour, who poll well in Harwich, are now the second largest group on the council, but the Holland-on-Sea Residents Association did buck this trend, greatly increasing their majority in St Bartholomews ward to turn it from a marginal into a safe ward, and also gaining from the Conservatives the other Holland-on-Sea ward (Haven ward).

The Residents Assocation have selected Chris Cowlin to defend the seat, while the Conservatives have picked the local county councillor Linda Mead who represents Clacton East division.  This time the by-election isn't a two-horse race as Labour have put nomination papers in for Keith Henderson, who completes the ballot paper.

TAVISTOCK NORTH, West Devon district council; caused by the resignation of 20-year-old Conservative councillor Darren Lake over inappropriate Facebook comments.

Tavistock, located twenty-five miles north of Plymouth, is the largest town in the sparsely-populated West Devon local government district.  Although known to the wider world almost solely as the birthplace of the Elizabethan admiral Sir Francis Drake, the town was already rich by Drake's time through a combination of religion (Tavistock Abbey), the cloth trade and tin-mining.  After the dissolution of the Abbey the dominant force in the town became the Dukes of Bedford who took over the abbey's land.  

Copper-mining became the major local industry by about 1800, earning the Dukes of Bedford so much money that they were able to comprehensively rebuild the town centre.  With such wealth eventually comes a major liability for death duties, and in 1911 the Bedford family had to sell most of their holdings in the town in order to meet them; the town council ended up with much of the property and as a result of these holdings is one of the richest parish councils in England.

Today Tavistock is a typical country market town with some Plymouth commuting and a significant tourist trade, drawn by its scenery, rural tranquility and the town's many independent shops.

The Tavistock North ward covers the part of the town north of the River Tavy, including much of the town centre, together with some rural scenery to the north, south and east (including a small part of the Dartmoor National Park).  Its past election results suggest that this is the sort of the area where the person matters almost as much as the party; the ward's three seats split 2C/1LD in both 2003 and 2007; the Lib Dems then gained a seat in a February 2008 by-election following the resignation (or possibly death; sources conflict) of one of the Conservative councillors.  The Conservatives did bounce back in 2011 to win all three seats, but the third Tory seat was gained with a majority of just one vote over a slate of independent candidates.

The poor Tory performance in the 2008 by-election, also held after a seat became vacant within a few months of election, does not give them much grounds for optimism this time round with the resigning councillor under somewhat of a cloud.  Nevertheless they have selected Colin Rogers, who has turned the town's old railway station into holiday accommodation (and got filmed by Channel 4 doing it).  Jeff Moody, one of the independent slate that came close to winning last year (he was 8 votes short), and Adam Bridgewater, who won the 2008 by-election for the Lib Dems, will probably provide the most testing opposition; also standing are Moira Brown for Labour (who stood in this ward last year), Andrew Mudge for UKIP and Daniel Worth, standing as an independent.

WALTHAM CROSS, Hertfordshire County Council; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Terry Price.

(My thanks to Broxbourne councillor Richard Clemerson for help with this preview.  Cllr Clemerson has written an excellent series of Wikipedia articles on local elections in Broxbourne: see 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertfordshire_local_elections> and <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broxbourne_local_elections>.)

This is the very south-eastern corner of Hertfordshire, located north of the M25 motorway (part of which here is in a tunnel) and west of the River Lea (or Lee; spellings differ).  Waltham Cross itself lies at the southern end of the ward; the cross the town is named after is one of the three surviving Eleanor Crosses, and marks the last resting place before London of Queen Eleanor's funeral procession from Lincoln to Westminster in 1290. 

In modern times News International have opened a large printing works next to the motorway which prints copies of The Sun and The Times, while the marshes next to the Lea (or Lee) which cover the eastern part of the county division have been developed as the Lee Valley White Water Centre, which later this year will host the canoe slalom events at the London Olympics.  The white water centre and town are served by Waltham Cross railway station on the West Anglia Main Line (two trains per hour to Liverpool Street via Tottenham Hale plus one train per hour to Stratford); also in the division is Theobalds Grove railway station on the Southbury loop line (two trains per hour to Liverpool Street via Seven Sisters).

The Waltham Cross county division currently covers the Theobalds and Waltham Cross wards of the Broxbourne local government district (although this will no longer be the case from May when new district wards are introduced in Broxbourne).  Broxbourne is generally prosperous and a Conservative stronghold; however, this town is the exception that proves the rule, with much of the division having similar demographics to the grottier parts of the London borough of Enfield, which lies immediately to the south.  

The effect of this is that the Waltham Cross district ward has voted Labour at every election since 2006, although sometimes narrowly, where over the same period every other Broxbourne ward has voted Conservative at every election, often with very large majorities.  At the last two county elections Theobalds ward has outvoted Waltham Cross ward to ensure Conservative wins in the county division, narrowly in 2005 but handily in 2009.  In the 2011 Broxbourne Borough elections the combined vote in the Waltham Cross and Theobalds wards for the Conservatives was less than 90 votes ahead of Labour.

Defending for the Conservatives is Dee Hart, who is a district councillor in Rosedale ward in Cheshunt.  Malcolm Aitken, one of the district councillors for Waltham Cross ward, will be hoping to gain the division for Labour in the by-election.  Completing the ballot paper are Peter Huse of the Lib Dems, a regular candidate in Broxbourne elections since the 1980s, and Albert Nicolas of UKIP, standing here for the first time.
