Thursday 1st March is my birthday.  It's also the date set for two county council by-elections in two of England's smaller county towns.

ABBEY, Shropshire Council; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Josephine Jones.

Abbey - not an exceptionally helpful name for a county division.  In fact at the last county council elections in 2009 there were five separate Abbey divisions contested in England.

This Abbey division is named after Shrewsbury Abbey, a former Benedictine foundation dating from 1083, and located east of the town centre along the road to London.  If the name sounds familiar, it's probably from the Brother Cadfael detective stories by Ellis Peters, which were set in and around the Abbey during the Anarchy period.  Much of the Abbey buildings are long gone now, but some of the church remains, so the Abbey has done better than the Gay Meadow, Shrewsbury Town's hilariously-named former football ground at the western end of the ward, now demolished.  Other buildings of note in the ward include the county council headquarters in the Shirehall, and the railway signalbox at Severn Bridge Junction; the world's largest remaining mechanical signalbox with 180 levers, it controls the junction at the south-east end of Shrewsbury station.

The division was created in 2009 for the first unitary Shropshire Council election, and runs along the southern edge of the Shrewsbury-Wolverhampton railway line.  The only previous result is from 2009 in which it was a safe Conservative area.  Previously on Shrewsbury and Atcham district council the western end of the division (including the Abbey) had been in the Lib Dem stronghold of Underdale ward, while the eastern end had been in the safe-Conservative Column ward of Shrewsbury and Atcham district council, and in the safe-Labour (at least in 2005) Monkmoor ward of the old Shropshire County Council.  The ward is entirely in the top half of the deprivation indices.

The list of candidates has a significant omission: there is no Labour candidate for the by-election.  Defending the seat for the Conservatives is Peter Wright, former Assistant Chief Constable of West Mercia Police.  The Lib Dems have nominated environmental scientist Hannah Fraser, and the other candidate for the by-election is retired college lecturer John Brown, standing for the Green Party.

CASTLE, Cumbria County Council; caused by the death of Liberal Democrat councillor Jim Tootle at the age of 59.  During his council career Tootle had blamed the "Cursing Stone", erected in Carlisle 2001 and inscribed with an ancient Border curse, for the 2005 Carlisle floods and 2001 foot-and-mouth outbreak.

Castle - not an exceptionally helpful name for a county division.  In fact at the last county council elections in 2009 there were five separate Castle divisions contested in England.

This Castle division is named after Carlisle Castle, which was built in the 11th century under King William II, and rebuilt in stone by his successor Henry I, to guard the English/Scottish border.  The castle saw action many times up until the unification of England and Scotland in 1603, and last saw action in 1745 when it was the last English garrison left by Bonnie Prince Charlie during the Jacobite rebellion.  Today the castle is open to the public, but the Army still has a presence here, the castle being the headquarters of the Duke of Lancaster's Regiment.  In 2009 I went to Carlisle Castle under their auspices as part of the centenary celebrations for the TA.

The county division named after Carlisle Castle falls into two separate parts.  To the west side of the castle and the River Caldew is the Willow Holme and Newtown areas around the Cumberland Infirmary.  To the east side of the castle is Carlisle's historic city centre, all of which is in this ward except for Citadel railway station.  The northern boundary of the ward is the River Eden and much of the north of the ward is flood plain.  Some Cumbria University buildings are within the ward, which is generally low-down in the deprivation indices.

The county divisions and city wards in urban Carlisle all have the same boundaries, so it's possible to look at the results here on an annual basis.  One thing that immediately sticks out is that Castle has a very high councillor attrition rate: this is the fifth by-election here since 2000, making fifteen polls here in eleven years (eight ordinary city council elections, three ordinary county council elections, three city council by-elections in April 2001, November 2005 and March 2009, and a county council by-election in February 2007).  From June 2001 to May 2010 all of these were won by the Liberal Democrats with Labour second, making Castle the only reliable Lib Dem ward in Carlisle.  Labour reduced the Lib Dem majority to 14 votes in 2010 and gained the ward from the Lib Dems last year, the first time they had won Castle since the April 2001 by-election when a Liberal Party candidate stood and split the Lib Dem vote.  The BNP polled well in the March 2009 by-election (19.7%) but have faded into the background since then.

Jim Tootle was also one of the city councillors for Carlisle, but as he was due for re-election in May there won't be a city council by-election before then.  This by-election is thus just for his county council seat.  Both of the remaining city councillors for the ward are contesting the by-election: Olwyn Luckley (re-elected to the city council in 2010 and winner of the 2007 county by-election) is looking to hold the county seat for the Lib Dems a second time and Willie Whalen (elected to the city council in 2011), a Ucatt union official, is hoping to gain the ward for Labour a second time.  At the time of writing the Wikipedia page for Carlisle says Luckley is already the county councillor - the election hasn't happened yet, people.  The Conservatives don't always stand here (there was no Tory candidate last year) but have found a candidate this time, Irthington-based businessman Keith Meller.  The Green party candidate Neil Boothman is a care worker, while UKIP are standing here for the first time in the shape of their 2010 parliamentary candidate for Carlisle, retired businessman Michael Owen.
