EAST BRIGHTON, Brighton and Hove city council; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Craig Turton due to poor health.

The East Brighton ward comes in two parts.  On the seafront is part of the Kemptown area around the Royal Sussex County Hospital, a traditionally bohemian area of Regency-style architecture.  Above it is the redeveloped council estate of Whitehawk, in a dry chalk valley with Brighton racecourse looping around it.  Much of the eastern half of the ward is open countryside, part of which is within the South Downs National Park.

Brighton and Hove is famous for having the only Green Party administration of a UK local authority, the Greens finishing as the largest party after the 2011 elections and currently running the city council as a minority.  East Brighton is not one of the Green wards, although they have progressed over the last three elections to dispute second place with the Conservatives, traditionally second here, at the 2011 elections.  This ward has returned a full slate of Labour councillors since 2003, and the Labour majority greatly increased in 2011 to make this the strongest Labour ward in Brighton.  The Conservatives fielded a celebrity candidate here in 2007, the former Dollar singer David Van Day, to little discernible effect.

Labour will be confident of getting their candidate returned in the by-election; she is Chaun Wilson, who works for a leading social care provider in Sussex.  The Green Party candidate is Carlie Goldsmith, a criminologist who is also familiar with the area's problems, having brought a family up in Whitehawk.  Both the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats have gone for youth: the Tories' Joe Miller is just 18 years old, while 20-year-old Sussex University student Dominic Sokalski is the Liberal Democrat candidate.  The only candidates with previous electoral experience are from the minor parties: Jon Redford of the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition fought Hanover and Elm Grove ward in 2011, while Sabina Choudhury was the UKIP candidate last year in St Peter's and North Laine ward.

FRAMPTON AND HOLME, Boston borough council, Lincolnshire; caused by the resignation of Independent councillor Bernard (Brian) Rush, apparently out of frustration with the council.

The Frampton and Holme ward lies to the south and west of the town of Boston, and consists of the parish of Frampton (based on the village of the same name south of Boston but which also runs to the north-east as far as Hubberts Bridge (two trains per day to Boston, Nottingham and Skegness).  The Holme in the ward name refers to the village of Kirton Holme just south of Hubberts Bridge, which is within the neighbouring Kirton parish.

Boston, like Brighton, is well-known among election geeks for a very strange minor-party result, in this case in 2007 when a single-issue party, the Boston Bypass Independents, came from nowhere to win a large majority on the district council.  Frampton and Holme was one of the wards to vote BBI, Brian Rush taking a seat which had been left open by the retirement of Joan Ashton (who had been elected unopposed in 2003).  Rush left the BBI later that year having failed to get the group leadership, and was re-elected as an Independent in the 2011 election which saw the Conservatives win overall control of the council.

Two rival independent candidates are standing in the by-election to replace Rush: Stuart Ashton, who runs a local farm and catering company and is the son of former councillor Joan Ashton, and Boston CAB manager Maggie Peberdy.  The Boston Bypass Independents, who have transformed into the Boston District Independents, are not standing.  UKIP have nominated Sue Ransome, a Kirton parish councillor who had a good result in the 2011 election, finishing as runner-up in the neighbouring Kirton ward.  A second Kirton parish councillor, Claire Rylott, is the Conservative candidate, and Labour are fighting the ward for the first time in the shape of Boston resident Mike Sheridan-Shinn, who was runner-up in the town's Pilgrim ward last year having fought a 2009 by-election there and stood for the county council the same year - as a Liberal Democrat.

MAIDSTONE CENTRAL, Kent county council; and ALLINGTON, Maidstone borough council; both caused by the death of Liberal Democrat councillor Malcolm Robertson at the age of 67.  A veteran of 30 years as a district councillor, he was Mayor of Maidstone in 1996.

The Allington ward is an area of mostly modern development on the north-western edge of Maidstone along the A20 road to London.  It is probably best known for the moated Allington Castle, which is the home of the noted psephologist Sir Robert Worcester, founder of the opinion poll company MORI, and Lady Worcester, and for Allington Lock which is the tidal limit of the River Medway.

The wider county division of Maidstone Central includes Allington and the three other wards of Maidstone town west of the Medway (Bridge, Fant and Heath) together with High Street ward on the east bank, which includes the town centre.

Maidstone is one of the areas where the formation of the coalition doesn't seem to have had that much effect on the Liberal Democrat vote; the Lib Dems are strong in the town but not strong enough to take the district council, which covers a rather wider area.  Allington ward is a safe Liberal Democrat ward thanks to a swing in their favour this year following a relatively good Conservative result in 2011.  The two-member Maidstone Central county division saw one of only two seat losses from the Conservatives at the 2009 county election which was otherwise a Tory landslide; Malcolm Robertson gained a second seat for the Liberal Democrats after the seats split LD/C in the 2005 election.

In the county division Robert Bird is the defending Liberal Democrats; he works at Maidstone CAB having retired from a career in treasury management and operational planning.  Paul Butcher, a local businessman who stood here in 2009, is the Conservative candidate.  UKIP and the Greens have also selected candidates who stood here in 2009, Stuart Jeffery and John Stanford respectively.  Paul Harper, an NHS trade union official, is the Labour candidate, and Michael Walters of the English Democrats has come all the way from Rochester to appear at the bottom of the ballot paper.

Belinda Watson will aim to defend the Lib Dems' district council seat in Allington ward; she works for a local charity which operates residential care homes in Kent.  The Conservatives' Barry Ginley stands here for the third election in a row; his blindness doesn't stop him commuting to London where he works at the Victoria and Albert museum.  Veteran Labour candidate Marianna Poliszczuk stands here for the eighth time, having contested the ward at every contest from 2002 to 2010; another serial candidate back for another shot at the ward is UKIP's Gareth Kendall, who last fought here in 2008.  The ballot paper is completed by the Green Party's Jill Shepherd.
