The sun is shining (hopefully), the Olympics are on the television and the summer holiday season is upon us.  With so many people going away, this is not a good time of year to hold a local by-election.  Knowing this, the local parties have arranged just seven by-elections for August, and five of them are being held on the 2nd.  Three of these are in Lincolnshire with the Conservatives defending two seats and one vacated by a long-serving independent.  There is also a Liberal Democrat defence in East Sussex, but this week's first preview is of a Labour defence in Glamorgan.  Appropriately for the time of year, we're off to a seaside town.

BUTTRILLS, Vale of Glamorgan county borough council, Glamorgan; caused by the death of Labour councillor Margaret Alexander, a former Leader of the Council, at the age of 73.

The entirely built-up Buttrills division lies at the centre of the seaside resort town of Barry, covering a mostly residential area along the Gladstone Road and centred on the Barry Memorial Hall.  It is named after a former farm which gave its name to the steep Buttrills Road.

Buttrills ward is a safe Labour area, although they were pushed fairly close by Plaid Cymru in 2008 (Lab 39.9 PC 32.8 C 27.3).  Plaid consolidated second place in the ward in 2012 as the Conservative vote collapsed.

Labour's candidate to succed Margaret Alexander is Brian Morris, who fought the neighbouring Court ward in May.  Plaid have reselected Ian Johnson, who fought the Vale of Glamorgan constituency at the 2010 general election and the 2011 Assembly election; he fought this ward at the previous election in May.  The other two candidates also stood here in May: Thomas Burley for the Conservatives and independent candidate David Green.  There was going to be a fifth candidate, Damian Chick having been nominated for the Lib Dems, but he has withdrawn from the by-election, joined Plaid and endorsed their candidate.

FLEET, South Holland district council, Lincolnshire; and LONG SUTTON, same council; caused respectively by the resignation of Conservative councillor Shaun Keeble and by the death of long-serving Independent councillor Dennis Tennant at the age of 76.

The Fleet and Long Sutton wards both lie to the east of Holbeach on the A17 road to King's Lynn.  Fleet is the first, directly to the east of Holbeach, and is based on the villages of Fleet (not to be confused with the Hampshire town of the same name) and Fleet Hargate.  The ward has the same boundaries as the bizarrely-shaped Fleet parish, which extends for twelve miles into the uninhabited Fens all the way to the Cambridgeshire border.  The ward also includes some new development on the edge of Holbeach which has outgrown the town boundary.

Further east is the market town of Long Sutton, which is large enough to have some industry, with Fray Bentos pies made here.  The town's church, St Mary's, is described as having England's highest lead spire.  The town is at the centre of a three-member district ward which also includes the villages of Lutton to the north, Little Sutton to the east and Tydd St Mary to the south.

South Holland's wards were redrawn in 2007, but both these wards were unchanged so there are plenty of previous results to go from.  The last three Fleet elections have all been won by Shaun Keeble for the Conservatives by majorities of 110-130 votes over independent candidate Duncan Woolard.  Long Sutton has returned a full slate of independents since 2007 when the Conservatives lost their last seat, with Dennis Tennant at the top of the poll; last year the Conservatives put up just two candidates, the top one of whom (Jack Tyrrell) lost out on the final seat by 68 votes.

Both by-elections are straight fights between Conservative and independent candidates.  In Fleet the defending Conservative candidate is Peter Coupland, of Fleet Hargate, who is opposed by Val Gemmell of Holbeach.  Both Long Sutton candidates give addresses in the town: Dennis Tennant's seat will be defended by his son Andrew, while the Conservative candidate is the aforementioned Jack Tyrrell who is also a parish councillor.

LINCOLN EAST, Lincolnshire County Council; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Sara Cliff.  Cliff is now living in Cambridgeshire and her attendance record since moving had been criticised.

This county division contains some of the most iconic areas of Lincoln, as it includes the Cathedral and part of the city centre.  The division runs east from the centre along the dividing line between uphill and downhill Lincoln, with Lincoln Prison at the division's centre.

Lincoln is a closely-fought marginal at parliamentary level, although Labour tend do better within the city proper.  It took the Labour meltdown of 2009 for the Conservatives to gain the county division, and since the Conservative majority at that election was just 4.7 points this is definitely a seat which Labour will have high hopes of gaining.  Conservative hopes here will not be helped by the fact that the city's Abbey ward, the nearest equivalent to this county division, consistently votes Labour at every election (although Lincoln's ward boundaries were redrawn in 2007 so results before then are not directly comparable).

The Conservative defence is led by Simon Parr, a mature politics student at the University of Lincoln.  Labour's defeated county councillor from 2009, Robin Renshaw, is standing again.  Also standing are Liberal Democrat candidate John Bishop, from the Lincoln suburb of North Hykeham; Elliott Fountain of the English Democrats, who lives over 30 miles away in Boston; Pat Nurse of UKIP and local resident Nick Parker for the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition.

POLEGATE NORTH, Wealden district council, East Sussex; caused by the death of Liberal Democrat councillor Roy Martin at the age of 86.

For the final preview this week it's off to the far south of England and the town of Polegate.  The town is at the junction of the A22 London-Eastbourne and A27 south coast road, but it started off life as a railway settlement, with junctions here from the Brighton-Hastings line to Hailsham and Eastbourne.  Polegate isn't an important railway junction any longer, but its railway station retains four trains per hour to Eastbourne and two hourly trains to London Victoria.  The town has an interesting link with BBC election nights, as David Dimbleby lives here.  The Polegate North ward covers the two-thirds of the town north of the railway line.

Polegate is in the Lib Dem-held Lewes parliamentary constituency, and in 2003 the Lib Dems won both seats in the ward.  In 2007 they lost a seat to independent candidate Oi Lin Shing, who at the last Wealden council election in 2011 got himself re-elected and three members of his family elected to the council.  The Lib Dem councillor Roy Martin was also re-elected in 2011.

Five candidates have been nominated all of whom give addresses in Polegate.  Defending for the Liberal Democrats is Don Broadbent, who retired last year as councillor for Polegate South ward.  His main opposition may well come from independent candidate and town councillor Joe O'Riordan.  Last year's Conservative and Labour candidates, Edward Board and Alex Mthobi respectively, are trying again, and the ballot paper is completed by UKIP candidate Bernie Goodwin, who fought Polegate South last year.
