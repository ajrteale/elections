This is the last big week for by-elections before the local parties start to wind down for the summer holidays.  The eight polls on Thursday 12th July can be divided into four pairs.  There are two by-elections to that most troubled of Welsh councils, Anglesey; the Conservatives have two seats to worry about in the rural south-east and two more defences in London; but to start this week I preview two by-elections in industrial wards in the towns of the English midlands which Labour are defending. 


COWLEY AND LITTLEMORE, Oxfordshire county council; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Sarah Hutchinson, who intends to move to London shortly once she has finished her doctorate.

Oxford will always be most famous internationally for its university, but at the southern edge of Oxford is Cowley, once home to the Morris Motors car factory.  The original Morris Motors factory has now gone and been replaced by a business park, but BMW still make the Mini in the area and the industrial legacy has left its mark on the surrounding area which still has a large Labour vote.

The last county council elections in 2009 saw Labour defeating the Conservatives in this two-seat county division by 40-23, with the Greens very close behind the Conservatives and the Lib Dems, who had been a strong second in 2005, falling to last place.  The three Oxford city wards included in this seat, Cowley, Littlemore, and Rose Hill and Iffley, returned a full slate of Labour city councillors in 2010 and 2012 with large majorities; the last time Labour failed to win all three wards was in 2006 when the Lib Dems gained Cowley.

Labour have selected one of the city councillors for Littlemore ward, Gill Sanders, to hold the seat.  She is opposed by Conservative candidate Judith Harley, who fought the county seat last time; education psychologist Paul Skinner standing for the Green Party; and librarian Mike Tait for the Liberal Democrats.

EAST, Corby district council, Northants; caused by the death of Labour councillor Pat Fawcett at the age of 68.  A district councillor since 1999, Pat had been Leader of the Council until stepping down in November last year.

From a successful industrial/tourist/student town to more of a post-industrial town.  Designated a new town after the Second World War, Corby had already grown from a small village at the start of the 1930s thanks to the steel industry, with a huge ironstone and steel works having been built in the early 1930s which attracted labour and employment, particularly from Scotland; it has been estimated that a third of Corby's population is Scottish-born or of Scottish descent, and there are large Celtic and Rangers supporters clubs (although how long the Rangers one will keep going is a matter for conjecture at the moment).  The steelworks were closed down in the 1980s, but strong government investment has led to steel being replaced by light industry, and the population is now growing again.  The district had new wards drawn up for the 2007 election after strong growth in part of East ward, which as the name suggests is on the east of the town, opposite the railway line and the works site.

Having described the town in such unambiguously industrial terms it comes as somewhat of a surprise to find that the parliamentary constituency named after the town is a bellwether marginal, having swung with the national tide since it was created in 1983.  This is more to do with the boundary commission than anything else, as the town is too small to form a constituency of its own and the parliamentary seat includes most of the very strongly Tory East Northamptonshire countryside.  Before 1983 Corby was in the same constituency as Kettering and formed a safe Labour seat.  The town itself is as Labour as you would expect; Corby district council used to have a large number of unopposed Labour returns but all the wards are now contested.  Nonetheless East ward in 2011 saw three Labour candidates opposed only by a single Conservative candidate and a single BNP candidate, Labour getting a good swing from the 2007 result to poll 65.5%.

The Tory and BNP candidates from last time, Kevin Watt and Gordon Riddell respectively, are trying again in the by-election in which the Labour candidate is Seán Kettle, who appears to be sponsored by the Unite union. [Tom: the a should have an acute accent in the Irish style.]  The Liberal Democrats are fighting this ward for the first time in the shape of Julie Grant, who completes the ballot paper.

GWYNGYLL, Isle of Anglesey council; caused by the resignation of Plaid Cymru councillor John Penri Williams for undisclosed reasons; and LLANBEDRGOCH, Isle of Anglesey council; caused by the resignation of unaffiliated councillor Barrie Durkin after he was suspended from the council for bullying the council's legal chief.

Anglesey is very much the island that politics forgot, and has become notorious for the number of defections between council groups, personality clashes, infighting and generally being completely inffectual.  In March 2011 the Welsh Assembly local government minister, Carl Sargent, lost patience and sent in commissioners from Cardiff to completely take over the running of the place.  The commissioners are still running the council and are expected to be there until the next election, which has been postponed to 2013.  According to the council website there are currently five Labour councillors, three 'Llais i Fôn' councillors, nineteen 'Original Independents', seven Plaid Cymru councillors and four unaffiliated councillors; somewhere in that soup of independents are the two councillors who were originally elected in 2008 as Conservatives and the two elected as Liberal Democrats.

In this context, it's rather telling that one of the resignations was prompted by a councillor being suspended for bullying.  This is in Llanbedrgoch division, which is named after the village off Red Wharf Bay on the east coast of the island, but whose main population centre is Benllech, the seaward half of which is in this division.  It elected Barrie Durkin in a very fractured election in 2008 where Durkin got just 29% of the vote; Plaid Cymru candidate William Jones was second with 24%, two more independent candidates got 17% each and the outgoing councillor William Roberts (who had beaten Durkin in 2004) was last with 13%.

Gwyngyll division is more on the beaten track, being the eastern of two divisions covering a village with a notoriously long name.  It's not clear to English speakers how to pronounce this, so I think we should take a lesson from some quiz experts:

[Tom: can you please insert this YouTube video here http://youtu.be/HI0w8e17K6M  It's a video of Bradley Walsh on 'The Chase' trying to pronounce Llanfairpwllgwyngyll.]

As Mark 'The Beast' Labbett now knows, Llanfairpwllgwyngyll lies in Anglesey.  It's at the northern end of the Britannia Bridge, one of the two bridges over the Menai connecting Anglesey to the mainland.  As well as being a place for Bangor commuters to live, Llanfairpwllgwyngyll has become a bit of a tourist trap, with people coming to get their photo taken next to the name sign at the railway station.  Gwyngyll ward doesn't include the railway station but does include the Marquess of Anglesey's column, erected to celebrate the Battle of Waterloo and offering fine views over the Menai.  The ward elected Plaid Cymru councillors in 2004 and 2008.

The Gwyngyll by-election looks like a bit of a one-horse race.  Plaid are not defending their seat, so the favourite would appear to be independent candidate Alun Mummery who is chairman of the community council and secretary of Llanfairpwll football club.  His sole opposition is from Elaine Gill, from the neighbouring town of Menai Bridge, who is standing for PADU, or as they are known in English, UKIP; she stood in Cadnant division (in Menai Bridge) in 2008 and lost a two-horse race by almost 7 to 1.

Llanbedrgoch could be a more difficult one to call.  At the top of the ballot paper is independent candidate Jeffrey Cotterell who would appear to be the chairman of the council's standards committee.  He is followed alphabetically by Nathan Gill of UKIP, who comes from Llangefni (the other three candidates give addresses in Benllech) and polled 4% in the town's Cefni division in 2008.  The Plaid Cymru candidate is Vaughan Hughes, who appears to be a magazine publisher.  Last on the ballot paper is another independent candidate, Carys Kilkelly.

HORNDEAN DOWNS, East Hampshire district council; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Julia Marshall for undisclosed reasons.

A staging post on the London-Portsmouth road, Horndean can be found in the South Downs about 8 miles north of Portsmouth, at the end of the A3(M) Waterlooville bypass, and is now basically a northern extension of Waterlooville.  The Horndean Downs ward, however, is a rather new housing area separate from the rest of the village, a southern extension of Clanfield hard up against the western edge of the A3 below Horndean Down.  The ward borders the new South Downs National Park but is not a part of it.

East Hampshire is one of the bluer parts of England, and this ward has been swinging to the Conservatives at a rate of knots since 2007 when they gained it from the Liberal Democrats by nine votes; in 2011 the Tory lead was up to 64-24.  However, the county division covering the ward (Catherington) swung the other way in 2009 with a Lib Dem gain from Conservative.

The Conservatives are defending the seat with Horndean parish councillor Guy Shepherd, whose main opposition will come from Lib Dem candidate Terry Port who fought the ward last year.  Also standing are Katie Green for Labour and David Alexander who is the ward's first UKIP candidate.

TENTERDEN SOUTH, Ashford district council, Kent; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Peter Goddard at the age of 73.

The Kent town of Tenterden can be found about 13 miles south-west of Ashford.  Originally a wool centre in the Weald, it was also engaged in shipbuilding and Tenderden was incorporated in the Cinque Ports as a limb of Rye; Tenterden is now many miles inland but in early mediaeval times much of Romney Marsh was under water, and the Isle of Oxney just south of Tenterden really was an island.  The Tenterden South ward, one of four wards covering the town, is a mostly residential and rural area running south-east from the edge of town past the hamlet of Leigh Green to Reading Street on the old seashore.

Peter Goddard was a fairly long-serving councillor who normally enjoyed comfortable majorities, although the Tory lead here has fallen over the last decade from 66-20 over the Lib Dems in 2003 to 59-41 last year in a straight fight with the well-organised Ashford Independents.  The ward is part of the very safe Conservative Tenterden county division.

The Conservative candidate in the by-election is Jill Hutchinson, who is opposed by the same Ashford Independent candidate as last year, Roy Isworth, who has the advantage of being the only candidate to live in Tenterden.  Also standing are Chris Took for the Lib Dems, Dara Farrell for Labour and Norman Taylor for UKIP, who are fighting the ward for the first time.

LARKSWOOD, London Borough of Waltham Forest, North London; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Ed Northover who has moved to Hong Kong.

We're in Chingford here, fabled as the home of the Essex skinhead, an image which is in no way encouraged by the fact that the two most recent MPs for the Chingford constituency are Iain Duncan Smith and Norman Tebbit.  The Larkswood ward is the eastern half of the Chingford Mount area to the south of the town, running along the eastern side of Chingford Mount Road and named after Larks Wood, one of several open spaces within the ward.  At the southern end of the ward is the former greyhound racing track of Walthamstow Stadium, controversially closed in 2008.  The ward lies entirely within the E4 (Chingford) postal district.

Waltham Forest is a polarised borough electorally, with the Conservatives normally sweeping all the wards in Chingford but getting nowhere in Walthamstow and Leyton which are Labour/Lib Dem fights.  Labour gained most of the Lib Dem seats in 2010 to take overall control of the council.  With this ward being in Chingford it's naturally safe Conservative, and the Tories had 54.5% here in 2010 to 28% for Labour and 17.5% for the Lib Dems.  In May Boris beat Ken here 57-29, UKIP finishing third although only with 74 votes (3.3%); UKIP were also third with 7.7% on the list vote in which the Tories beat Labour by 42% to 31%.

UKIP are not following up on this relative success by standing a candidate in the by-election which has a field of five.  The Tory candidate is John Moss, chairman of the Walthamstow constituency party, while Labour have selected Peter Woodrow, who is the chairman of the Chingford Line rail users' association and is campaigning for a link to allow Chingford branch trains to go to Stratford.  The Lib Dems have selected former Waltham Forest councillor Graham Woolnough who is a regular candidate here.  Another former Lib Dem Waltham Forest councillor, James O'Rourke, is standing for the unreconstructed Liberal Party, and the ballot paper is completed by Leyton-based retired adult education tutor Bill Measure.

TOWN, London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham, North London; caused by the resignation of the Leader of the Council Stephen Greenhalgh in order to become Deputy Mayor of London for Policing.  Mr Greenhalgh was a Conservative councillor.

"Town" is one of those generic, unimaginative ward names which there are too many of and can, particularly in cases like Hammersmith and Fulham with two distinct areas, be downright confusing.  The Town in this case refers to Fulham, and the ward runs along the Fulham Road from Fulham Palace Road up to Fulham Broadway.  Entirely built up, it is served by the Parsons Green underground station on the Wimbledon branch of the District Line.  The ward is entirely within the SW6 (Fulham) postal district.

Fulham has a reputation as a very upmarket area which is rapidly becoming as unaffordable as neighbouring Chelsea.  The resultant demographic change has turned Hammersmith and Fulham council into a Tory bastion and Stephen Greenhalgh, who became Leader in 2006, had been working hard to turn the council into a 'flagship' Tory administration in a similar vein to Wandsworth on the other side of the river.  A former councillor for this ward, Greg Hands, is now the Conservative MP for the super-safe Chelsea and Fulham constituency.

Typically, the voting patterns for Town ward are best described as safe Conservative.  At the last council election in 2010 the Tories had 56% of the vote here, the Lib Dems overtaking Labour to come second with 24%.  Two months ago Boris beat Ken here 68-21.

The Conservative candidate fits the young professional family stereotype of Fulham residents, although he actually gives an address in Hammersmith: Andrew Brown works as a healthcare consultant and has a wife and baby daughter.  The Lib Dems are standing scientist and lawyer Paul Kennedy of Fulham, while Labour's candidate Ben Coleman, of Shepherd's Bush, is described as a local entrepreneur.  The four council elections here since 2002 (including a by-election in October 2009) have all been between the three main parties, but this time UKIP are fighting the ward; they have nominated West Kensington-based Andrew Elston.
