Just one by-election this week, in the smallest English shire.

UPPINGHAM, Rutland County Council; caused by the death of Independent councillor Colin Forsyth, a former dentist and Mayor of Uppingham who was awarded an OBE in 2001 for services to dental care for prisoners.

The market town of Uppingham is the second town of Rutland, by far England's smallest county.  Located on the Leicester-Peterborough road, the town is most famous for its public school, which is now in its fifth century and has educated four current MPs (Conservatives Robert Adley, Stephen Dorrell and Edward Timpson together with Jenny Willott of the Lib Dems) as well as many other members of the British great and good, including recent Strictly Come Dancing winner Harry Judd.  The town, together with the tiny parish of Beaumont Chase to the south-west, forms Rutland County Council's only three-member ward.

Uppingham's political representation has been stable since the current ward boundaries came in in 2003.  Marc Oxley of the Lib Dems is the town's longest-serving councillor, having been returned at all three elections since 2003 (when he topped the poll).  There has been one Conservative councillor, Kenneth Bool standing down last year and being replaced by Lucy Stephenson, who topped the poll.  Finally, there has been one independent councillor, Peter Ind serving until 2011 when he lost his seat to Colin Forsyth (who had won a previous by-election in 2002, gaining the seat from Labour, before losing to Mr Ind in 2003).

Previous election results have been marked by undernomination: May 2011 saw two candidates each from the Conservatives and Lib Dems and two independent candidates, and in 2003 and 2007 the main parties never stood more than one candidate.  Labour last fought the ward in 2003, although their candidate from that year stood as an independent in 2007 and came last in a field of five candidates.

The by-election will result in a change to Uppingham's political balance as there is no independent candidate in the by-election.  However, the previous undernomination and personal votes make the by-election tricky to call.  Leading the charge for the Tories is retired council planning officer Carolyn Cartwright, while the Lib Dem candidate Peter Golden is a veteran councillor who is hoping to get back on the county council after losing his seat last year in Normanton ward.  The ballot paper is completed by Labour candidate Julie Park.
