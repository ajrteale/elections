There are seven by-elections on 15 March 2012, possibly the busiest remaining day for local by-elections before the main local elections in May.  Three wards in the Essex town of Braintree will go to the polls, as will an industrial Tory Nottingham suburb, a safe Lib Dem Portsmouth suburb and a rural ward on the Yorkshire coast which elected a Green councillor last year.

BRAINTREE EAST, BRAINTREE SOUTH, and GREAT NOTLEY AND BRAINTREE WEST, Braintree district council, Essex; caused by the resignations of Conservative councillors David Messer, Stephen Sandbrook and Claire Sandbrook respectively.  All three former councillors have moved away from the area.

Braintree appears to be one of the more determinedly obscure towns in southern England.  It can be found in the rural northern half of Essex, about eleven miles north of the county town, Chelmsford.  The town was originally Roman and is located at the junction of two Roman roads, but it became prosperous in mediaeval times by weaving wool, turning to silk during the Industrial Revolution; the main silk mill here was run by Samuel Courtauld, whose descendants founded the Courtauld Institute of Art in London.  Probably the main reason for outsiders to visit is the designer outlet village of Braintree Freeport.

Today Braintree has boomed with overspill from Chelmsford and London (the town and the Freeport have stations on a single-track branch off the Great Eastern Main Line; there are hourly trains to Liverpool Street, change at Witham on Sundays).  To accommodate the incomers, much new housing has been built, including the modern private garden village of Great Notley to the south-west of the town, which declared independence in 2000 and became a civil parish of its own.

Braintree is in a rural area but this doesn't necessarily translate to strong Tory votes.  The area has had Labour MPs in the past, most famously Tom Driberg in the 1940s and 1950s, when this area was part of the Maldon constituency; more recently Braintree elected a Labour MP in 1997 and (narrowly) in 2001.

Indeed Braintree town is one of the more politically marginal areas.  Braintree East ward (which contains some very deprived parts as well as the Freeport) was fairly safe Labour in 2003, but the Conservatives gained one of the Labour seats in 2007 and held on to it in a June 2008 by-election.  Last May's election again produced a 2Lab/1C split in what was effectively a photo-finish between the top candidates.

Braintree South ward is more socially mixed and consistently marginal.  In 2003 it elected two Labour councillors and one Lib Dem, who stood alone, Labour topping the poll.  The Conservatives got in on the act in 2007, gaining a seat from Labour and making the ward a three-way LD/C/Lab split, the Lib Dems topping the poll.  The Conservatives held a by-election here in June 2010.  The Lib Dem councillor retired in 2011 and the Conservatives gained the Lib Dem seat and finished top of the poll to make the ward 2C/1Lab.

Great Notley and Braintree West ward, however, is safe Conservative as befits the fact that it's almost entirely a private middle-class estate.  At every election here since 2003 the Conservative majority has increased.

The candidate list shows that there are no Lib Dem candidates in any of the three wards, as in 2011; however, in Braintree East former Lib Dem candidate Paul Lemon is standing as an independent.  In that ward Labour are standing Eric Lynch, who lost his seat here last year, while the defending Conservative candidate is chartered engineer and technologist Stephen Nimmons, who fought the Green Party stronghold of Bradwell, Silver End and Rivenhall ward last year.  The Green Party's candidate is Wendy Partridge, who stood here last year, and Phil Palij is standing for UKIP.

Braintree South has the shortest ballot paper with just three candidates.  Abi Olumbori, who won the 2010 by-election here but unsuccessfully fought last May's election in Bocking South ward, is standing again for the Conservatives.  Labour (Martin Green) and the Green Party (Timothy Reeve) have selected candidates who fought Braintree South last year.

Finally, the Conservative candidate in Great Notley and Braintree West is Frankie Ricci, who is up against three candidates who were unsuccessful in other wards last year: Juliet Walton for Labour, Lynne Maynard for the Greens and Gordon Helm for UKIP.

CHILWELL AND TOTON, Nottinghamshire County Council, caused by the death of Conservative councillor Tom Pettengell; and TOTON AND CHILWELL MEADOWS, Broxtowe district council, Nottinghamshire, caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Craig Cox.

We're in the Greater Nottingham area here, for Chilwell and Toton are two middle-class suburbs of Nottingham, located to the south-west of the city hard up against the Derbyshire border.  

The area's generally middle-class makeup rather belies a recent industrial past: Chilwell first became a major residential area during the First World War to serve a large military ordnance factory which filled the gap between Chilwell and Toton (and which blew up in 1918 killing 134 people), while Toton to the west grew up in the nineteenth century thanks to Toton Sidings, once Europe's largest railway marshalling yard, which received coal from the Nottinghamshire coalfield and sorted it for distribution across the UK.  The military still have a presence and the marshalling yards are still there, but both are now much reduced from their former glories.

The Nottinghamshire county council division of Chilwell and Toton includes the Broxtowe district wards of Toton and Chilwell Meadows at the western end, Chilwell West in the middle and Chilwell East at the eastern end.  Since 2005 all these areas have returned a full slate of Conservative district and county councillors, including a district council by-election in Toton and Chilwell Meadows in September 2009 which the Tories easily held.  The last non-Tory win here was in 2003 when Labour won one of the three district council seats in Chilwell West, which is more socially mixed than the other two wards.

The 2005 county council result in Chilwell and Toton was quite close between Labour and the Conservatives.  This was held on the same day as the 2005 general election, in which then Labour MP Nick Palmer held on to the local Broxtowe parliamentary constituency.  Palmer regularly posts on political/electoral internet forums, including turning up on Britain-Votes' live blog last Thursday night.

Labour made a recovery in the area in 2011; while they didn't win any seats the two Chilwell wards are now marginal, with Toton and Chilwell Meadows being safer for the Conservatives.  Across the three wards in 2011 the Conservatives beat Labour by 48% to 36%.

Despite this, Labour are not going to be gaining a seat in the county by-election for the simple reason that they haven't nominated a candidate.  The Tories have selected local doctor John Doddy to replace Tom Pettengell, a former chairman of the county council; he will face competition from Lib Dem David Watts, a district councillor representing Bramcote ward, and UKIP candidate Lee Waters.

Issues in the district by-election include plans for 800 new homes in the ward and cuts to Toton's bus service.  The Tory candidate is Halimah Khaled, a charity worker and mother of 3 grown up children.  Her main opponent is Jane Marshall for Labour, who was 33 votes away from winning a seat in Chilwell East ward last year; also standing are Barbara Carr for the Lib Dems and UKIPper Keith Marriott.

HERTFORD, Scarborough district council, North Yorkshire; caused by the resignation of Green Party councillor Nick Harvey, apparently out of frustration that he was being ignored by council chiefs.

Scarborough is one of those councils where the ward names don't necessarily give you any clue as to where within the district they are.  This is certainly true of Hertford ward, which in fact is a rural ward covering the area to the south and west of Filey. It is named after the River Hertford which here flows away from the sea along the ward's northern boundary into the Vale of Pickering.

The largest settlement within the ward is the village of Hunmanby, one of several places which claim to be England's largest village, which has a railway station on the Yorkshire Coast line (nine trains per day to Hull and Scarbrorough, six trains per day on Sundays); other settlements within the ward include Folkton and Muston on the Filey-Malton road, Reighton on the Filey-Bridlington road, and the Filey holiday camp, which was once Butlins' premier resort but is now operated as a caravan park by the Haven group.

Hertford ward has a rather high councillor attrition rate, this being the third by-election here in six years.  The Conservatives won both seats in 2003, the second seat by just fifteen votes over the Lib Dem candidate, won a bizarre by-election in November 2006 which was a straight fight with the BNP, and held both seats in 2007.  Then in August 2009 Nick Harvey won a by-election for the Green Party with a huge share of the vote, and he was re-elected at the top of the poll last year, the Conservatives winning the other seat.

The by-election campaign appears to have one overriding issue: the closure of Hunmanby library by North Yorkshire county council, despite (according to the current edition of Private Eye magazine) 25 local people being prepared to volunteer to run it.  There is also controversy over a proposed wind farm in the area.

The Greens have not nominated anyone to replace Harvey, so the Conservatives would appear to be well-placed to take the seat back; the Tories have selected a strong candidate, Michelle Donohue-Moncrieff who is the chairman of Hunmanby parish council (and stood as the Lib Dem candidate here in 2007).  The other three candidates are all based in Scarborough: Vanda Inman is standing for Labour, Bob Jackman for the Lib Dems, and Michael James is the ward's first UKIP candidate.

PORTCHESTER EAST, Fareham borough council, Hampshire; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Chris Brown just before he was to be disqualified for not attending any council meetings in six months.

Like Braintree above, Portchester is a Roman town, located on the northern bank of Portsmouth Harbour between the city of Portsmouth and the town of Fareham.  Unlike Braintree, there are major Roman remains here: the Roman fort of Portus Adurni built to protect the harbour is described as the best-preserved Roman fort north of the Alps, largely because it was so strong that when the Romans left it became an Anglo-Saxon stronghold, then a Norman castle, and ended its useful days as a prison during the Napoleonic wars.  The town of Portchester, which grew up around the fort, was never incorporated into Portsmouth and is now the eastern end of Fareham district; essentially it's a middle-class Portsmouth suburb.

Fareham is one of that handful of councils which have elections by halves, in which half the council is up for election every two years.  The relevant boundary commission mostly ensured that those councils had a uniform pattern of two-member wards, but failed to do so with Portchester East which ended up as a three-member ward.  This means that Portchester East alternates between electing one and two councillors at each election, an electoral cycle it shares with just one other ward in the entire country.

Not that this affects things much politically - Portchester East is a safe Lib Dem ward with the Conservatives running a distant second, although admittedly the last local election here was in 2010 so the effect of the Coalition has not been tested in Portchester yet.  

There are a few articles about the campaign on the local newspaper website portsmouth.co.uk, although as usual the online comments on the articles generate more heat than light.  Issues which have come up include the possible introduction of charging for public car parks in Portchester (with all five candidates coming out against) and whether the sea defences are adequate.

One interesting aspect of the candidate list is that the Lib Dems have selected Geoff Fazackarley, who was one of the Tory candidates here in 2010.  The Conservatives have gone for Alison Walker, daughter of Portchester West councillor Nick Walker.  The Labour candidate is Richard Ryan, who in the dim and distant past was a district and county councillor for the area and still regularly stands here.  The ballot paper is completed by Green Party and independent candidates John Vivian and Manny Martins.
