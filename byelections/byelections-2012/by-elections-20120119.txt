Two Lib Dem seats are being defended in the by-elections on 19th January, one safe and one marginal.

BATCHWOOD, St Albans DC, Hertfordshire; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Amanda Archer, who has taken a politically restricted post in the Civil Service.

Twenty miles north of London can be found the city of St Albans.  Originally a Roman city and the first stop out of London on Watling Street, it is named after St Alban, the first British Christian martyr, who was beheaded here by the Romans.  The Benedictines built a major abbey dedicated to St Alban, and from Saxon times the town became a place of pilgrimage; the abbey church became the parish church after the dissolution of the monasteries, and was made a cathedral in 1887.  

Real development of the city didn't get going until the twentieth century, but particularly after the Second World War the city boomed with London overspill.  One of the areas that was developed in response was Batchwood ward, which lies on the north-western edge of the city between the Redbourn Road and the Harpenden Road.  St Albans' excellent rail link to London (six trains per hour to St Pancras station) has made the city very sought-after by commuters, but Batchwood ward has been rather left behind in this process and contains some of the most deprived parts of the city, particularly along the Redbourn Road.

Politically, Batchwood is an oddball as well.  St Albans council (which also covers Harpenden and villages to the north) is closely fought between the Lib Dems and Tories and can often produce wrong-winner results, in which the Conservatives poll most votes but the Lib Dems win most seats.  Batchwood, however, was a Labour stronghold during the Blair years mostly thanks to an evenly-split opposition, although strong Lib Dem campaigning slowly turned the ward into a marginal with Labour majorities of 34 in 2004 and 92 in 2007.  

The Lib Dems finally gained the ward in 2008, and on general election day in 2010 unseated the leader of the council's Labour group, Roma Mills, by just one vote with the Conservatives not far behind; not a good day for Mills who was also the unsuccessful Labour candidate for the St Albans constituency that year.  The formation of the Coalition appears to have hit the Lib Dem vote here hard, as last May they fell to third place for the first time since 2003, with Labour increasing their majority to the point where the ward looks safe again.

There is some pressure for the Lib Dems here in terms of control of the council; they lost several seats in 2011 and Amanda Archer's resignation gave the Conservatives a majority on the council.  While the Conservative candidate Tim Smith is unlikely to win the by-election to preserve that majority, the Lib Dems need a good performance in this by-election to have any hope of stopping the Tories from taking overall control at the next election in May.  

The Lib Dems will try and hold their seat with David Partridge, who lives in the New Greens area at the north end of the ward, while Labour have selected Roma Mills.  Mills' strong result in 2006 (when this was the district's only Labour ward) would appear to indicate that she has a personal vote, and this by-election provides her with a good chance to get back on the council.  Completing the ballot paper is Naomi Love from the Green Party, who stood here last year.

NEWCOMEN, Redcar and Cleveland council; caused by the death of Liberal Democrat councillor Glynis Abbott.

Welcome to sunny Redcar, a town on the coast east of Middlesbrough with the unusual combination of seaside resort, flat racecourse and steelworks.  The beach lies at the north-eastern edge of the town, the racecourse is rather incongruously located in the middle of the town, built up on all sides, while the steelworks and chemical works to the west completely fill the gap between Redcar and Middlesbrough.  

Newcomen ward is located in the middle of the town, running south from Redcar Central station (two trains an hour to Middlesbrough, Darlington and Saltburn) alongside the western edge of the racecourse.  The deprivation indices get worse the further south you go in the ward, with the south end of the ward merging into the very working-class area of Kirkleatham ward.

The steelworks has been unquestionably the major political issue in the town in recent years, with the closure of the works in February 2010 followed by a sensational Liberal Democrat gain at the general election three months later.  Following the announcement that the steelworks were to reopen under new ownership, the Lib Dems followed up in the 2011 council elections by topping the poll in five of the town's six wards, including Newcomen, and comfortably held a double by-election in the seafront Zetland ward in November last year following a row over whether the Lib Dem councillors had politically restricted posts.

This bodes well for the Lib Dems in this ward over the other side of the racecourse, where the yellow horse will start off as a short-priced favourite according to the formbooks.  Glynis Abbott, in tandem with her husband Chris, had won the previous four races for this ward, the last three by distances, and Chris has been a councillor even longer than that.

Of course, all the good horse races are handicaps, and the new Lib Dem candidate Dave Stones, a local Scout group leader, has certainly made a rod for his own back: the Labour campaign has dug up some (at best) very dubious Facebook remarks Stones made back in 2010 which you can read at http://politicalscrapbook.net/2012/01/lib-dem-anti-islam-candidate/, and Labour is playing the race card for all it's worth with a local Labour MP asking Nick Clegg to disown Stones.  The Lib Dems are standing by their runner, although it remains to be seen whether the resultant heavy going will cost him significant ground in the race.

Hoping to come up on the rails and be first past the winning post for Labour is ex-Lib Dem councillor John Hannon, whose previous election results appear on your racecard as "314" - third in 2007 (in Zetland ward), winner in 2008, fourth in 2011.  Hannon spectacularly gained Kirkleatham ward for the Lib Dems in an October 2008 by-election but appears to have fallen out with the party after that, running for re-election in Kirkleatham as an independent in May and being just edged out on the line by Labour; he finished fourth in the race for three seats, 39 votes short of third place.

Completing the list of runners and riders is the rank outsider in this race: Matthew Bennett of the Conservatives, a 19-year-old from a steelworking family, who is hoping to become Redcar's youngest-ever councillor.  The minor parties are non-runners this time.
