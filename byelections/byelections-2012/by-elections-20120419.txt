With just two weeks to go before the May elections, people looking for some electoral straws in the wind have four by-elections to chew on in London and the South East, three of which are in wards which will seem strangely familiar to those who follow local by-elections closely.

GORESBROOK, Barking and Dagenham, North London; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Louise Couling due to ill-health.  She had been on leave of absence from the council for over a year.

Barking and Dagenham is one of those places where ward names don't mean a lot to people not from the area.  The Goresbrook ward is named after the Gores Brook and specifically Goresbrook Park at its centre, an area of land which was left undeveloped due to its low-lying flood plain nature when the rest of the area was built on as part of the enormous Becontree Estate.  The ward, which straddles the old boundary between Barking and Dagenham, lies between the A13 Ripple Lane to the south and the District Line to the north; just outside the north-west corner is the Becontree underground station on the District Line.  The population of the ward is generally white working-class, and the area scores poorly on the deprivation indices.

The ward has a very unusual recent electoral history, although you wouldn't have been able to tell from the May 2002 result which resulted in a safe Labour win of all three seats against only two Liberal Democrat candidates.  The fun started in September 2004 when a by-election was held here which resulted in a gain for Dan Kelly, representing the British National Party.  It was the first BNP seat on Barking and Dagenham council, at the time the only BNP council seat in London, and an omen of things to come.  

Dan Kelly's time as a councillor was short-lived due to poor health and he resigned after a few months, forcing a further by-election in June 2005 at which Labour's candidate Warren Northover regained the seat.  However, the fun was not over; between the two by-elections was the 2005 general election at which the BNP candidate for Barking, Richard Barnbrook, finished a strong third just 27 votes behind the Conservatives, although well behind the re-elected Labour MP Margaret Hodge.

Hodge talked up the BNP threat before the 2006 borough elections.  Her fears were well founded; the BNP could only find thirteen candidates across the borough but twelve of them got elected with vote shares that suggested the BNP could have seriously challenged for control of the council had they nominated a full slate.  Two of the BNP councillors - Richard Barnbrook and Tracy Lansdown - were elected in first and second place in Goresbrook ward, with Warren Northover the only Labour councillor to be re-elected, coming in third place.

Barnbrook rose highly in the ranks of the London BNP, becoming the leader of the BNP's largest council group.  In 2008 he was the BNP candidate for Mayor of London and top of the BNP list for the London Assembly.  He came a strong third to Boris and Ken in his own ward (Boris topping the poll) and the BNP topped the poll here in the list section of the London Assembly ballot.  Across London the BNP list narrowly made it over the 5% threshold for representation in the Assembly and Barnbrook became the GLA's first BNP member.

In 2010 Labour got their act together as the main BNP opposition, prompted by the BNP leader Nick Griffin standing in Barking at the general election which was held simultaneously with the London borough elections.  Allowing for boundary changes, Griffin actually polled a lower share of the vote than Barnbrook had in 2005, while the increased turnout allowed Labour to defeat every BNP councillor - and every other opposition councillor, Labour finishing with all 51 seats on the council.  This despite Labour deselecting their only Goresbrook councillor Warren Northover, who stood in the ward as an independent and came last.

Labour didn't hold all 51 seats for long: it turned out that Louise Couling, one of their new Goresbrook councillors, was ineligible to be a councillor as she worked for the council as a lollipop lady.  This prompted an immediate by-election in July 2010, at which Couling, now no longer a lollipop lady, faced off against Richard Barnbrook for the second time and won again, though rather more narrowly.  Couling has now caused a second by-election in this ward through her resignation.

For the by-election Labour have selected Simon Bremner, a local school governor who has fought a council by-election before, although he won't want the voters to be reminded of his performance at the 2003 Longbridge ward by-election in which he lost the seat to the Conservatives on a massive swing.  Richard Barnbrook has left the BNP after unsuccessfully challenging Griffin for the party leadership in 2010, and their new standard-bearer in the ward is Bob Taylor.  The other candidates are Robert Hills who is standing for the Lib Dems, Mohammed Riaz for the Conservatives and John Dias-Broughton who has the UKIP nomination.

SPITALFIELDS AND BANGLATOWN, Tower Hamlets, North London; caused by the disqualification of ex-Labour councillor Shelina Akhtar who was sentenced to sixteen weeks in prison for benefit fraud; she had left the Labour party to join the independent group on the council supporting the elected mayor Lutfur Rahman.

From Becontree station, the underground station for Goresbrook ward, it's only twelve stops up the District Line to Aldgate East, the underground station for Spitalfields and Banglatown ward.  Both wards are part of the London Assembly's City and East constituency.  However, they could not be more different.

Directly north-east of the ancient City of London, Spitalfields and Banglatown ward is an entirely built-up area lying to the north of Whitechapel Road, to the west of Vallence Road and to the south of Quaker Street.  In contrast to Goresbrook's White British nature, Spitalfields has been a centre for immigration for centuries, starting in the late seventeenth century when Huguenot silk weavers set up here; they were followed by Irish weavers in the eighteenth century, Jewish refugees in the nineteenth century, and Bangladeshi immigrants in the twentieth century who made Brick Lane, which runs north to south through the centre of the ward, famous for its curry houses.  In the 2001 census this ward was 70% non-white and 58% of the population were recorded as Bangladeshi; the 2002 ward boundary review added the name Banglatown to the ward to reflect its demographic makeup.

The north-western end of the ward, including the Old Spitalfields Market and the Liberty of Norton Folgate (which until 1921 was a real place rather than a Madness album), is rapidly gentrifying thanks to its proximity to the City and association with famous artists; Gilbert and George and Tracey Emin all live in Spitalfields.  Another Spitalfields resident is the architectural historian Dan Cruickshank, who must take some responsibility for some of the gentrification thanks to a successful campaign to save Spitalfields' Georgian merchant terraces from demolition.  By contrast, the ward's four other census areas are all among the most deprived in the country.

The politics of the ward looked simple when it was created in 2002, Labour winning by a large margin from the Conservatives.  Two of the three Labour councillors elected were Helal Abbas and Lutfur Rahman, and the power struggle between them for the council leadership has been a leitmotif of Private Eye's Rotten Boroughs column for much of the period since.

In the years from 2002 to 2006 minor parties started to get in on the act in Tower Hamlets: Respect won their first council seat at a 2004 by-election in St Dunstans and Stepney Green ward, and a couple of months later the Conservatives won their first ever seat on Tower Hamlets council at a by-election in Millwall ward, the scene of that notorious 1993 by-election which elected the first ever BNP councillor (although the BNP have not had a presence here since).  Then in 2005 Respect, in the shape of George Galloway, gained the Bethnal Green and Bow parliamentary constituency, and followed up in 2006 with a strong assault on the council which Labour were lucky to withstand; Respect became the main opposition group and the Labour majority was cut to one.  One of Respect's twelve council seats came in Spitalfields and Banglatown ward, with Abbas and Rahman the two remaining Labour councillors.

The Respect breakthrough was short-lived and by 2008 the group had fallen apart, with some of its members defecting to Labour and some of the rest ending up in a Left List group reflecting the split in Respect more generally.  Respect and the Left List stood against each other at the 2008 GLA election; the Left List made no impact whatsoever but Respect came second in Spitalfields and Banglatown on the list ballot.  The ward voted overwhelmingly for Ken Livingstone as Mayor.

In May 2010 a referendum was held in Tower Hamlets following a controversial petition for an elected mayor; this resulted in a 60% Yes vote.  At the same time Labour greatly increased their majority at the Tower Hamlets council election, Respect being reduced to one seat.  Rahman and Abbas were re-elected as councillors for Spitalfields and Banglatown and were joined by their running-mate Shelina Akhtar who defeated the Respect councillor Fozol Miah.

The Yes vote in the referendum meant that there was a mayoral election in October 2010.  Following a very messy selection the then council leader Helal Abbas ended up as the Labour candidate with former council leader Lutfur Rahman standing against him as an independent with Respect support.  Rahman won in the first round.  This prompted a by-election in Spitalfields and Banglatown in December 2010 which Labour lost to the Respect candidate, former councillor Fozol Miah.

Since Rahman's election as Mayor several Labour councillors have left the party to form an Independent group on the council supporting Rahman.  One of them was his former ward colleague Shelina Akhtar, whose prosecution has resulted in a second by-election in this ward in seventeen months.

For this by-election Labour have selected former Tower Hamlets councillor Ala Uddin, seeking to return to the council after a ten-year break.  His main competition will probably come from Independent candidate Gulam Robbani, who was Rahman's election agent in the Mayoral election and then worked as an aide for Rahman; Rahman has signed Robbani's nomination papers.  There is no Respect candidate this time so the winner will probably come from those two.  Also standing in the by-election are Matthew Smith for the Conservatives, Kirsty Blake for the Green Party and Richard Macmillan for the Lib Dems.

PLAISTOW, Chichester district council, West Sussex; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Linda Westmore.

From Aldgate East station, the underground station for Spitalfields and Banglatown ward, it's only seven stops down the District Line to Plaistow, the underground station for...  Sorry, scrap that.  That's a different Plaistow; this Plaistow is a large and remote rural area on the northern edge of Sussex, including part of the South Downs National Park.  The four main villages in the ward are Lurgashall, Northchapel, Plaistow itself and Loxwood; the nearest towns of any size are Billingshurst and Haslemere.

That's not the interesting thing about this ward.  The really interesting thing is the sheer number of by-elections which this ward generates; this is the fifth by-election here since Plaistow ward was created in 2003, and the eighth election in all during that period.  In May 2003 the ward elected Brian Hooton and Anthony Walker; Walker died shortly afterwards and Paul Mackey won the by-election in August 2003; Hooton and Mackey were re-elected in May 2007; Mackey resigned and John Andrews won the by-election in February 2009; Hooton resigned and Philippa Hardwick won the by-election in February 2010; Andrews resigned and Linda Westmore won the by-election in November 2010; Hardwick and Westmore were re-elected in May 2011; Westmore has now resigned.

All of those councillors were Conservatives, and the defeated Liberal Democrat candidate on every occasion has been Lurgashall parish council chairman Ray Cooper, who is standing again.  Defending this safe ward for the Conservatives this time is Nick Thomas, a former district councillor for Midhurst ward.

WATLINGTON, Oxfordshire county council; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Roger Belson at the age of 62.  A former Irish Guards officer, he was paralysed in a road accident in 1989 but had served as councillor for Watlington since 2001 and was on the council's cabinet from 2005 to 2009.

Watlington is a tiny market town in the Chiltern hills, about fourteen miles south-east of Oxford.  It's at the centre of a large county division which stretches along the Chiltern Hills from Nettlebed in the south to the outskirts of Chinnor in the north-east.  The M40 crosses the north of the division giving good road links to Oxford and London.

On the face of it, this is probably the least interesting of this week's four by-elections, as the two previous results have seen very solid Conservative wins, and the two constituent district council wards (Aston Rowant and Watlington) are also very solid Conservative areas.

The defending Conservative candidate is Caroline Newton, about whom I have no information.  The Lib Dems and Labour have both selected unsuccessful candidates for the district council last year, Nicholas Hancock and James Merritt respectively; Hancock is a Watlington parish councillor.  The ballot paper is completed by UKIP candidate Jonathan Kent.
