There were two by-elections scheduled for 12th January to start of the year.  However...

BRADWELL, Derbyshire Dales DC; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Janet Goodison.

Bradwell ward covers a very beautiful stretch of the White Peak, running up from the Hope Valley onto the high limestone plateau to the south.  Bradwell itself is at the north end, and the ward runs south along the B6049 to Tideswell to include the parishes of Hazlebadge, Little Hucklow, Great Hucklow (where I once stayed on a Cub Scout camp), Grindlow and Foolow.  Just outside Bradwell is the Bagshawe Cavern cave system, where potholers can cut their teeth.  Apart from tourism, the main local employer is probably the cement factory at Hope, just outside the ward, which dominates the Hope Valley.

This is one of those wards which is so rural and parochial it rarely gets a contested election: Janet Goodison was elected unopposed in 2003 and 2007 but did face a contest last year, defeating Independent candidate Christopher Furness by 430 votes to 364.  Furness has managed to get the Conservative nomination for the by-election, and with nobody else having submitted nomination papers he has won the by-election unopposed.

CINDERFORD WEST, Forest of Dean DC, Gloucestershire; caused by the death of Labour councillor Frank Beard.

One of England's largest surviving natural forests, the Forest of Dean has a unique industrial history, as an ancient royal hunting ground located on deposits of iron ore and coal measures.  Miners from the Forest helped Edward I to gain Berwick-upon-Tweed from the Scots by undermining the town's defences; the result was that Edward I granted free mining rights within the district to locals.  Even today, under the Dean Forest (Mines) Act 1838 men over 21 who were born within the Hundred of St Briavels and have worked a mine for a year and a day can register to be freeminers.  (In 2010 Elaine Horman became the first woman freeminer.)

The Dean Forest (Mines) Act also allowed freeminers to sell their rights; this allowed the necessary investment to build and operate deep mines.  The result was that the industry rapidly expanded, and to serve it the planned town of Cinderford was born.

Deep coal mining in the Forest ended in 1965, although the freeminers still work some private mines, and today light industry predominates as the main employer, with some tourism.

The mining legacy still has its effect on politics in the area (although not as much as on polling day in 1874 when rioters ransacked the Conservative HQ in Cinderford) with the town of Cinderford being safe for Labour even during their recent nadir.  The Forest was a Labour seat from 1997 to 2005; even in 2007 Cinderford's two wards returned a full slate of five Labour councillors with comfortable majorities; and Labour held the Cinderford county division in 2009 with a majority of almost 10%.  The late councillor Frank Beard had only been elected to the district council in 2011 but had previously served on the town council for many years including a term as Mayor of Cinderford.  Like his ZZ Top namesake, he didn't have a beard.

The by-election has attracted candidates from the three main parties plus UKIP, who are standing here for the first time.  The Lib Dem candidate is the same as last year.
