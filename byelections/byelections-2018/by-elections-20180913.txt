There are six by-elections on 13th September 2018.  After last week's Labour Northern special, this time there's a bit more political variety with four Conservative defences and two Labour; one of the polls is in Wales to bring closure to one of the most horrific recent stories to come out of local government, while the five English by-elections are all in London, the South or Leicestershire.  This column is not scared of discussing the major issues of the day where they are on topic, so let's start the week in the city of Cambridge...

<h2>Petersfield</h2>

Cambridge city council; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Ann Sinnott, who had served since 2014.

<blockquote>
They're used to the vilification.  Now transgender people have had enough and are poised to demand their civil rights.

A month before the self-styled "bearded lady" Conchita Wurst was hailed queen of a tolerant, rainbow Europe, Britain had a milder revolutionary moment.  Emma Laslett, a student of French at Lincoln College, Oxford, competed in the semi-final of <em>Mastermind</em> (specialist subject, coincidentally, Eurovision 1981 to the present day).

It takes nerve to enter that unblinking spotlight, but immesurably more for Emma, a transgender woman who does not, as she says, easily 'pass' as female.  Comments online were of the 'Gawd, there's a bloke in a frock on <em>Mastermind</em>' variety.  But Emma says this is just the 'background radiation' of her life...

In Britain tolerance of gays and lesbians is now almost universal: to my kids a person's sexuality is no more remarkable than their hair colour.  So why are transgender people still vilified, far more likely to be beaten up or even murdered, and ostracised at work (if they can find a job at all)?
</blockquote>

That was the present AQA textbook for A-level Sociology, quoting from a <em>Times</em> article of 31st May 2014.  As your columnist, a stereoypical <em>cis</em> man, can testify from experience, getting into the semi-finals of <em>Mastermind</em> takes a awful amount of nerve, hard work and luck.  I've managed it once in four attempts.  The man who developed <em>Mastermind</em>, Bill Wright, had been taken prisoner by the Germans in the Second World War, and he translated his recurring nightmares of being asked for "name, rank and number" into "name, occupation and specialised subject".  The entire programme is set up as an interrogation, which is an intimidating and stressful experience for most people on its own; the fact that the present interrogator is the veteran political journalist John Humphrys means that the experience of the fabled Black Chair is one to which many professional politicians can relate.

As your columnist can also testify from experience, Emma is one of the most intimidatingly intelligent people I've ever met.  In each of the four years since that <em>Times</em> article was written, she has tempted the cream of Britain's quizzing community to her native Milton Keynes where she hosts a very enjoyable day-long tournament playing quizbowl.  For those who aren't aware, quizbowl is a similar game to, but for legal and copyright reasons <em>not the same as</em>, the long-running TV gameshow <em>University Challenge</em>.  (Due to similar legal and copyright reasons <em>University Challenge</em> is still produced by ITV even though it hasn't gone out on that channel for over thirty years.  It's all to do with Americans and their lawyers.)  At the most recent tournament, held over the August Bank Holiday weekend, your columnist was in a team which included a TV Egghead but still finished thirteen out of fourteen teams.

If your columnist and a professional quizzer can finish so far down the field, you might reasonably ask what sort of people did well in Emma's tournaments?  You might be surprised to hear that most of them are present university students or recent graduates, and many of them will be familiar faces to people who religiously watch <em>University Challenge</em>.  If these people are our future - and <em>University Challenge</em> has had more than its fair share of contestants who have gone on to be famous or notable - then our future is in good hands.

But in these sped-up days of the twenty-first century <em>University Challenge</em> contestants are becoming famous or notable while their series is still being broadcast.  When I did the programme, getting to the quarter-finals with Warwick in the 2002-03 series, social media as we know it today did not exist - Facebook was founded in 2004, YouTube in 2005, Twitter in 2006 - and the major feedback to our performance came from our circle of frends and the campus newspaper.  People we knew.  No longer is that the case.  A later Warwick team, captained by past <em>Countdown</em> series champion Giles Hutchings, also reached the quarter-finals in the 2016-17 series, where they were eliminated by a team from Wolfson College, Cambridge.  That match got writeups and dedicated articles not just from the usual suspects like Digital Spy, but also from the websites of the <em>Daily Mail</em>, the <em>Daily Express</em> and the <em>Huffington Post</em>.  In some respects those articles are exemplars of the laziest type of modern journalism - hang out on Twitter for half an hour of a Monday evening and let members of the public do the writing for you - but they do reflect a genuine interest in what is consistently one of the most popular programmes on BBC2.  As distilled in those articles, the talk of the Twitterati was clearly on the battle between the teams' star players, Wolfson captain Eric Monkman and Warwick's Sophie Rudd.

Nowhere in those <em>Express</em> or <em>Huffington Post</em> articles would you find any hint that Rudd is transgender.  And that's how it <em>should</em> be.  To quote the closing sentence of the <em>Times</em> article on Emma Laslett, "the ultimate liberation for Emma would be appearing on cosy, middle-England <em>Mastermind</em> and no-one remarking on anything but her score".  We may not have achieved that goal yet - as the length of this preview demonstrates - but the reaction to Rudd v Monkman, just three years down the line from Laslett's <em>Mastermind</em> appearance, demonstrates that society has moved a bit further down that road.

And not before time.  The <em>Times</em> article made the point that half of one percent of the population are trans in some form or another.  That's a lot of people, and through sheer weight of numbers you'd expect that to be reflected in our elected representatives - with over 20,000 councillors in the UK, proportionally that would translate to at least 100 trans-councillors.  However, research by Cambridge city councillor ZoÃ« O'Connell has identified just eleven openly trans people who have ever served in our town or county halls (plus former MEP Nikki Sinclaire).  Five of them are currently serving, two Labour (including Osh Gantly, re-elected to Islington council this May after transitioning during her first term of office), one Conservative, one UKIPper and one Liberal Democrat (O'Connell herself).  Four of them are or were Cambridge Lib Dems.

Which finally brings us to the point of this article, which is after all a council by-election preview.  The Labour party may well get around to being an opposition at some point, but there are internal disputes to indulge in first; and one of the most incomprehensible of them relates to whether transwomen can have access to all-women shortlists.  Outgoing Labour councillor Ann Sinnott was on the "no" side of that debate.
