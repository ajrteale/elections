Three by-elections for four seats on Thursday 17th May:

<hr/>

<h2>Skerton West; and<br/>
University and Scotforth Rural</h2>

Lancaster council; caused respectively by the death of Roger Sherlock, councillor for Skerton West ward; and the resignations of Sam Armstrong and Lucy Atkinson, councillors for University and Scotforth Rural ward.  All were Labour councillors.

Let's start this preview by going back in time sixteen years.  (God, that makes me feel old.)  In May 2002 I was nineteen years old and coming towards the end of my first year at the University of Warwick.  A member of the Russell Group, Warwick is one of the so-called "plate glass" universities, opened in the early 1960s on a self-contained campus site on the outskirts of Coventry.  I was attempting to study mathematics and statistics, had been selected for the <em>University Challenge</em> team and had got stuck into the elections committee of the Students' Union.  Having gained experience of running a polling station in the union's elections, I applied for and got a casual job as a poll clerk, helping to run the Coventry city council election of 2nd May 2002.

For polling day we took over a room in the University's Ramphal Building, and the presiding officer and myself were responsible for an electorate of around 4,000: almost all of them first- and third-year students. That covered the majority of the campus, although not all of it - the Warwick campus straddles the border between the city of Coventry and Warwick district, and we did have to turn away a few disappointed students from the wrong side of the line.  4,000 is a very large electorate for a polling district in the UK, but we were not rushed off our feet: the turnout was 8.4%, around 300-400 people.  Then as now Warwick University was part of the Wainbody ward of Coventry: this is a safely Conservative area and it's clear from that sort of student turnout that the main driver for its election results is the permanent population.  The Tory candidate turned up at the polling station to see how we were getting on - he seemed a nice sort.

Yes, university students don't generally vote in local elections.  Why should they?  Most students won't hang around for a full four-year electoral cycle.  Student housing is on one-year lets, and it's common for students to move around on and off halls of residence and find themselves in different wards from one year to the next.  Student houses are exempt from council tax.  Many students might never intend to return to the place they studied at; and, especially in a campus-based "bubble" place like Warwick, students might not feel much if any affinity towards the city they're nominally studying in.

And these days there's an extra dfficulty for the student who wants to become a local election voter.  When I was living on the Warwick campus my registration to vote was handled by the University administration, which delivered a list of all the eligible voters to Coventry city council (and Warwick district council) as part of the admissions process without my having to lift a finger.  These days Individual Electoral Registration prevents that, and students instead have to fill in forms and send them into the council themselves.  The effect of this can rather starkly be seen in the Notice of Poll for the 2018 Coventry city council election: where in 2002 I was responsible for around 4,000 voters, the electoral register reveals that only 167 students had sent in the form to register to vote by the qualifying date for the December 2017 roll.  Although many students will have registered since, that's still an enormous drop.

Now imagine this sort of drop in enrolment taking place in a ward whose electorate is <em>almost entirely</em> composed of students.  Let me take you to Lancaster University.  Like Warwick, Lancaster punches above its weight educationally and politically: two current MPs, Alan Campbell (Lab, Tynemouth) and Cat Smith (Lab, Lancaster and Fleetwood) are alumni, while the former cabinet minister Alan Milburn - another alumnus - is the present Chancellor.  Like Warwick, Lancaster is a member of the Russell Group.  Like Warwick, it's one of the 1960s "plate-glass" universities.  Like Warwick, it's set on its own campus, on a hill just to the south of Lancaster between the West Coast Main Line, the A6 road and the M6 motorway.  Like Warwick, it's on a growth spurt and new buildings have outgrown the original campus - a new south-west campus has sprung up in recent years.

Unlike Warwick, the Lancaster University campus was from 2003 to 2015 its own electoral ward.  The 2011 census makes the point that this was a unique ward, quite unlike any other in the UK.  94% of the population were aged between 18 and 29, 94% were full-time students, 68% were educated to A-level but not (yet) further - all of those statistics were the highest for any ward in England and Wales by a very large margin.  University ward also made the top 100 in England and Wales for households living rent-free, although this may be a side-effect of the fact that the census only recognised sixty-two households here.  (Perhaps the colleges count as one household each?)

Any student of UK opinion polls is going to have no trouble guessing that Unversity was politically a left-wing ward.  And given that Lancaster's campus has an almost completely new electorate from one year to the next, it shouldn't be surprising that University ward's election results were volatile.  It voted Lib Dem on its creation in 2003, Green in 2007 and Labour in 2011.

The building and expansion of Lancaster University has made a mess of the administrative boundaries in the area, which have struggled to keep up with the changed times.  A boundary review tried to sort this out for the 2015 election, expanding University ward to take in the south-west campus and the non-student parish of Scotforth, which covers some lovely but sparsely-populated countryside.  Might not be sparsely-populated for long, though, as the city council is consulting on plans for Bailrigg Garden Village, a new settlement of 3,500 homes to be built within this ward.

The new University and Scotforth Rural ward had three councillors rather than two, and split them politically: in the 2015 election Labour polled 35% and won two seats, the Greens polled 32% and one seat, and the Tory slate (one of whom rejoiced in the name of Ice Dong) were third with 24%.

After the 2015 election Individual Electoral Registration came in, and this affected University and Scotforth Rural possibly more than any other ward in the UK.  The ward suffered an enormous drop in enrolment for the first affected register, in December 2015; and that prompted the University administration to get creative for the 2016-17 academic year.  Their solution was to boost registration by taking electoral registration back in house: they asked new students, as part of the course registration process, whether they would like to <em>opt out</em> of that.  This has got the student electorate back up near where it was - the Notice of Poll for this by-election has an electorate of 3,789, of which the two parts of Scotforth parish contribute 257 - but it does introduce a delay because the applications can't go to Lancaster electoral services until after term has started.

A problem for Matt Mann, a Labour councillor for University and Scotforth Rural, who had started a job outside Lancaster in September 2016 and wanted to resign to allow a new councillor to be elected in his place.  Councillor Mann ended up having to delay his resignation in an attempt to ensure that the campus register was as complete as possible.  The by-election was eventually held in Decemer 2016, and Labour held the seat with 98, to 79 for the Greens and 68 for the Conservatives.  Those figures are <em>votes</em>, not percentages, and new Labour councillor Nathan Burns holds the dubious record of being the only English district councillor this century (outside the City of London and the Isles of Scilly) to be elected with fewer than 100 votes in a contested election.  Turnout was reportedly around 7%.

The other two councillors elected in 2015 have now resigned, presumably being about to complete their studies: Lucy Atkinson, who topped the poll for Labour in the 2015 election, was just 18 at the time and became the youngest ever Lancaster city councillor.  Labour are defending both seats up in this rare double by-election, as Green councillor Sam Armstrong had defected to the party since his election.

The stakes in this by-election are high.  Labour are the largest party on Lancaster city council, holding 28 out of 60 seats, plus these two vacancies, plus a further vacancy in Skerton West ward which will be covered in the next section.  The Conservatives are in second with 18 seats, the Green Party have 7 and the other four are held by independents of various stripes.  If Labour lose any of the three Lancaster city council seats they are defending today, their majority is gone - and this ward is definitely not safe Labour.

The defending Labour slate is Amara Betts-Patel and Oliver Robinson, both of whom live on the campus.  The Greens have indulged in their occasional practice in multi-seat First Past the Post elections of nominating "first choice" and "second choice" candidates: their first choice, according to the ballot paper, is Martin Paley who is reading Earth and Environmental Science, while relegated to second is Jan Maskell who is possibly the only non-student on the ballot paper.  A part-time lecturer at the University's Management School, Maskell came within two votes of winning a by-election to Lancaster city council last year in her home ward of Halton-with-Aughton.

The University's Conservative Society have nominated their general secretary Callum Furner (who is reading economics) together with Guy Watts (management).  Some of the points in their five-point manifesto - such as improved bus frequencies for the campus, improvements for mental health services and "protecting and enhancing the night-time economy" might not sound like traditional Tory policies, but then again a ward which is over 90% student needs bespoke policies wherever you are on the political spectrum.  (I still fondly remember the Monster Raving Loony Party candidate for Warwick SU president, who wanted to improve student health by (a) converting the Union's fruit machines to pay out in real fruit, and (b) installing central heating at the bus stop.  Sensible stuff.  I wonder what he's doing now.)  Completing an eight-strong ballot paper are the Lib Dem slate of Iain Embrey (studying for a PhD in economics) and Jade Sullivan (reading History and Politics).  Let's hope for a better turnout than in the 2016 by-election.
