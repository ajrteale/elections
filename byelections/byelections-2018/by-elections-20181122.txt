<h2>Bush Hill Park</h2>

Enfield council, North London; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Jon Daniels who had served only since May this year.  In his resignation statement Daniels said that he had been unable to balance his duties as a councillor with his family and work commitments.

For our second London by-election we take the Central Line to Liverpool Street and head north into the wilds of Middlesex.  Since 1880 Bush Hill Park has been the last stop for branch line trains going to Enfield Town; the station was opened to serve a housing estate built on the grounds of a country house of the same name.  We're a fair way out of London here and the estate was rather slow to grow - not helped by its developer going bankrupt in 1887 - but the growth of the firearms industry in Enfield to supply the Boer War caused demand to pick up, and by the outbreak of the First World War Bush Hill Park was fully developed.  Many of those Edwardian houses are still with us today thanks to a conservation area being created in the mid-1980s; only the northern end of the ward, around Enfield cricket club, has seen significant redevelopment.

For parliamentary purposes Bush Hill Park is within the Edmonton constituency and is by far the least-deprived ward within it.  That gives a right-wing slant to its politics which would have pleased one of the ward's most famous residents: Ross McWhirter, the sports journalist and <em>Guinness Book of Records</em> co-founder, lived in this ward on Village Road and was murdered there by the IRA in 1975.  McWhirter had been the Conservative candidate for Edmonton in 1964, doing rather poorly in what had five years earlier been a very close seat.

In fact the Edmonton constituency was often a key marginal until quite recent times: the Conservatives gained it at the 1987 election and held it in 1992.  Since then the Tory vote here has fallen off a cliff and by June 2017 the Conservatives had just 23% of the vote across the constituency, a 12-point swing against them since the Coalition was formed.  A large proportion of those Tory votes will have come out of Bush Hill Park, which is the only ward within the seat to reliably return Conservative councillors.  Until the 2010s, that is: Labour came from a long way back to gain one of the ward's three seats in 2014; the Tories recovered their monopoly in May this year but their third seat only had a majority of 64 votes.  Vote shares were 39% for the Conservatives, 37% for Labour and 11% for the Green Party.  That closeness was also a feature of the 2016 GLA elections here: Zac Goldsmith beat Sadiq Khan in the ward's ballot boxes 44-36, while the Tory lead over Labour in the London Members ballot was just 37-36.

But as the reverse in May's election might suggest, not all is rosy here for Labour.  The party control Enfield council; and their Edmonton MP Kate Osamor, the shadow international development secretary, has attracted controversy after her son, whom she employs as her parliamentary press officer, pleaded guilty to possession of Class A drugs with intent to supply.  More on that story in a future edition of Andrew's Previews.

In the meantime the Conservatives have to defend this by-election.  They have selected James Hockney, a businessman who may well be one to watch for the future: he is seeking to resume his elected career after being a South Cambridgeshire councillor from 2004 to 2016, and was the Tory candidate for Barnsley East in the 2010 general election and for Barnsley Central in the 2011 by-election.  Labour have reselected Bevin Betton, an HR consultant who was runner-up here in May.  Also returning from May's election is Benjamin Maydon of the Green Party, who according to his Twitter is a musician, comedian, writer, actor, English teacher, precocious genius and awkward geek.  Three more candidates complete the ballot paper: they are Robert Wilson for the Liberal Democrats, Tulip Hambleton for the Women's Equality Party and independent candidate Erol Ovayolu.
