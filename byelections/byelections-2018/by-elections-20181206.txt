Four by-elections on Thursday 6th December 2018:

<h2>Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh</h2>

Highland council; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Kate Stephen.

Winter is coming.  We travel to the frigid and sparsely-populated North for a fascinating contest to start off this week's by-elections.  It's a land of many political interests, with intrigue aplenty as the various actors seek independence or control of the levers of power (or both) amid some of the most beautiful scenery and dubious weather imaginable.  In the latest eagerly-anticipated episode the Liberal Democrats have abdicated their share of the quadripartite throne, and it's a fight to the political death for the right to sit uneasily upon it.  There's only place we can possibly be.  Welcome to Wester Ross.

A phroase which may often be said by the locals, for this area is popular with holidaymakers from all over the world.  The mountain scenery is spectacular, with the Ice Age having left behind deep valleys separating steep mountains of over 1,000 metres in height, which attract the camera and test the Munro-bagger.  Those mountains are important to science as well.  The Torridon Hills in particular are made up of some of the oldest rocks in the world: 500-million-year-old pre-Cambrian sandstone sitting on Lewisian gneiss up to 3,000 million years old, which has weathered to create the west coast of the Hifglands as we know it today.  This is a haven for wildlife, with all sorts of habitats from littoral to moorland; there are very few people living in this area and even fewer roads.  Applecross, on the west coast, was accessible only by boat until the twentieth century, and for some years afterwards only via one of the steepest and most notoriously bad roads in the UK: the Bealach ne Bà.

Further to the south is Lochalsh, which is similar in character but with a larger population, and traditionally was administered as part of Inverness-shire rather than Ross-shire.  A history of Lochalsh really does read like <em>Game of Thrones</em>, with Dál Riata, Norway, Alba, the Kingdom of the Isles and various clans all fighting for supremacy at some point or another.  The picturesque Eilean Donan castle, controlling the main road to the Kyle of Lochalsh and the Isle of Skye, beare witness to some of the more recent squabbles in this vein: it was destroyed in 1715 after the local Clans Mackenzie and Macrae had been leaders of the first Jacobite rebellion, and the modern castle is a twentieth-century reconstruction.  That doesn't stop it being a tourist trap, mind.  The main settlement here is Kyle of Lochalsh, from which a bridge leads over the sea to Skye.  Kyle is one of the two railheads for Skye, but the railway doesn't follow the main road: instead it takes a more northerly route towards Easter Ross and Inverness, passing villages such as Plockton on the shores of Lochcarron.

Further to east the mountains ease but you still can't get away from tourists.  Strathpeffer owes its very existence to non-locals: it was built in the Victorian era as a spa town, and at one point was the most northerly spa in Europe.  Although the ward is known for its severe winter weather, Strathpeffer tends to avoid the worst of this through being sheltered to the west and north.

With all those inhospitable mountains, this is by a very large margin the UK's largest electoral ward.  The Ordnance Survey has measured its area as 494,726 hectares or 1,190 square miles, which is bigger than two EU member states (Luxembourg and Malta) and one US state (Rhode Island).  Only six English counties are larger.  The notice of poll reveals that this vast expanse has just 10,014 electors, who will be served by 25 polling sttions.  The smallest of these with just 47 electors is at Achnasheen, a railway station on the Kyle Line and not much else; while the largest polling station in the ward with 1,543 electors is at Ullapool.  The largest and most important village in Wester Ross, Ullapool was founded in 1788 by the British Fisheries Society and the sea is still important to its economy.  There are regular roll-on roll-off ferries from here to Stornoway in the Outer Hebrides (yes, even on Sundays these days) and some fishing boats and yachts still operate out of this port on Lochbroom.




and there is more space for agriculture.  However, the main town in this area is Strathpeffer, a Victorian spa reso
