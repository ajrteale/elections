Four by-elections on Thursday 6th December 2018:

<hr/>

<h2>Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh</h2>

Highland council; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Kate Stephen.  She was first elected in 2012 for Culloden and Ardersier ward, transferring here following boundary changes in 2017; Stephen is standing down to increased work commitments.

Brace yourselves.  Winter is coming.  We travel to the sparsely-populated North for a fascinating contest to start off this week's by-elections.  It's a land of many political interests, with intrigue aplenty as the various actors seek independence or control of the levers of power (or both) amid some of the most beautiful scenery and dubious weather imaginable.  In the latest eagerly-anticipated episode the Liberal Democrats have abdicated their share of the quadripartite throne, and it's a fight to the political death for the right to sit uneasily upon it.  There's only place we can possibly be with that introduction.  Welcome to Wester Ross.

A phrase which may often be said by the locals, for this area is popular with holidaymakers from all over the world.  The mountain scenery is spectacular, with the Ice Age having left behind deep valleys separating steep mountains of over 1,000 metres in height, which attract the camera and test the Munro-bagger.  Those mountains are important to science as well.  The Torridon Hills in particular are a magnet for geologists as they are made up of some of the oldest rocks in the world: 500-million-year-old pre-Cambrian sandstone sitting on Lewisian gneiss up to 3,000 million years old, which has weathered to create the west coast of the Highlands as we know it today.  There are also attractions for the natural sciences as this area is a haven for wildlife, with all sorts of habitats from littoral to moorland; there are very few people living in this area to disturb the natural order, and even fewer roads to disturb the countryside.  One of the roads which does exist here is notorious for its steep and treacherous route: but for many years the Bealach ne Bà was the only road connection to the west coast village of Applecross.  Until it was built, anybody who wanted to travel to or from Applecross had to board a boat.

Further to the south is Lochalsh, which is similar in character but with a larger population, and traditionally was administered as part of Inverness-shire rather than Ross-shire.  A history of Lochalsh really does read like <em>Game of Thrones</em>, with Dál Riata, Norway, Alba, the Kingdom of the Isles and various clans all fighting for supremacy at some point or another.  The picturesque Eilean Donan castle, controlling the main road to the Kyle of Lochalsh and the Isle of Skye, bears witness to some of the more recent squabbles in this vein: it was destroyed in 1715 after the local Clans Mackenzie and Macrae had been leaders of the first Jacobite rebellion, and the modern castle is a twentieth-century reconstruction.  That doesn't stop it being a tourist trap, mind.  The main settlement here is Kyle of Lochalsh, from which a bridge leads over the sea to Skye.  Kyle is one of the two railheads for Skye, but the railway doesn't follow the main road: instead it takes a more northerly route towards Easter Ross and Inverness, passing villages such as Plockton on the shores of Lochcarron.

Further to east the mountains ease but you still can't get away from tourists.  Strathpeffer owes its very existence to non-locals: it was built in the Victorian era as a spa town, and at one point was the most northerly spa in Europe.  Although the ward is known for its severe winter weather, Strathpeffer tends to avoid the worst of this through being sheltered to the west and north.

With all those inhospitable mountains, this is by a very large margin the UK's largest electoral ward.  The Ordnance Survey has measured its area as 494,726 hectares or 1,190 square miles, which is bigger than two EU member states (Luxembourg and Malta) and one US state (Rhode Island).  Only six English counties are larger.

The notice of poll reveals that this vast expanse has just 10,014 electors, who will be served by 25 polling stations.  The smallest of these with just 47 electors is at Achnasheen, a road junction and railway station on the Kyle Line and not much else; while the largest polling station in the ward with 1,543 electors is at Ullapool.  The largest and most important village in Wester Ross, Ullapool was founded in 1788 by the British Fisheries Society and the sea is still important to its economy.  There are regular roll-on roll-off ferries from here to Stornoway in the Outer Hebrides (yes, even on Sundays these days) and some fishing boats and yachts still operate out of this port on Lochbroom.

The Scottish Highlands is one of the last strongholds of the independent councillor and, at election time, is a place where the person often matters more than the party, although this isn't always foolproof - as could be attested by the case of Charles Kennedy, who represented this area in Parliament until 2015 when even he got swept away by the SNP tide.  Until 2007 independents were in the ascendancy in this area, which was covered by several single-member electoral wards; but two of those wards had in 2003 elected party candidates, the SNP's Jean Urquhart winning Lochbroom ward (Ullapool and its hinterland) and the Lib Dems' Isabelle "Biz" Campbell being unopposed in Kinlochshiel ward (Lochalsh except for Kyle).

Both of these councillors were re-elected at the first election for the current ward in 2007, with two new independent councillors - Richard Greene and Audrey Sinclair - winning the ward's other two seats.  Urquhart stood down in 2012 and was replaced by new SNP councillor Ian Cockburn; Campbell, who was re-elected on the Lib Dem ticket, immediately left the party and went independent.  Not that it did her much good initially: an SNP-led coalition was formed to run the council with the independent group shut out, but that coalition fell apart in 2015 with the independents then forming a minority administration.

In 2017 the SNP nominated Cockburn for re-election and tried for a second seat with new candidate Alexander MacInnes; independent councillors Biz Campbell and Richard Greene stood for re-election, Audrey Sinclair retired, and the Lib Dems nominated outgoing councillor Kate Stephen who had previously sat for Culloden and Ardersier ward (east of Inverness) but had been displaced by boundary changes.  When the votes came out of the ballot boxes it was a complicated picture: 26% for the SNP, 18% for the Conservatives whose candidate Derek MacLeod led on the first count; and a bunfight for the final two seats between Campbell (14%), the Lib Dems (13%), Greene (12%) and the Scottish Green Party (11%).  In the count Cockburn was the first candidate to reach the 20% required for election, after his running-mate MacInnes was eliminated.  Outgoing independent councillor Richard Greene attracted very few transfers and was overtaken by the Green Party; Greene's transfers put the Tories and Biz Campbell over the winning line, and the Lib Dems' Kate Stephen held off the Greens to win the final seat by 1,026 votes to 934.

With that sort of fragmented political picture, and with a very long candidate list for this by-election, the result of this poll looks rather unpredictable.  Particularly so given that this is a Scottish local by-election, and so the Alternative Vote and Votes at 16 apply here.  Defending for the Lib Dems, who start from fourth place, is George Scott who gives an address on Skye.  The SNP have reselected their losing candidate from last year, Alexander MacInnes.  MacInnes is fighting his second by-election of the year having stood in the neighbouring Caol and Mallaig ward in April, but this is his home turf - he lives in Wester Ross, is a native Gaelic speaker and works in the seafood industry.

Three of the candidates give addresses outside the ward in the village of Muir of Ord.  One is the Conservative nominee Gavin Berkenheger, a geologist who runs a company looking for gold deposits in Scotland.  The other two are the two independent candidates, both of whom are former Highland councillors who lost their seats in 2017: one is Richard Greene who represented this ward from 2007 to 2017, while the other is Jean Davis who won a by-election in 2015 for Aird and Loch Ness ward on the Lib Dem ticket but lost re-election there last year (again as a Lib Dem).  The following month Davis stood for Parliament as a Lib Dem, failing to recover the Ross, Skye and Lochaber seat which the late Charles Kennedy lost in 2015.

The Scottish Greens, who were runners-up here last year, have selected Irene Brandt who lives in a village near Ullapool and is described as a community campaigner.  Completing the nine-strong ballot paper are Labour's Christopher Birt, who finished last here in 2017; Harry Christian for the Libertarian Party; and Les Durance for UKIP.

I cannot resist finishing this preview with one of my favourite pieces of music.  The brass band composer Philip Sparke wrote a suite some years ago called <em>Hymn of the Highlands</em>, many of whose movements are named after locations in this ward - including the final movement "Dundonnell", which in the video below is paired with a series of beautiful photographs of the Highlands.  Hopefully this will help to set the scene - and maybe even provoke a yearning to be another of those tourists that come here?
