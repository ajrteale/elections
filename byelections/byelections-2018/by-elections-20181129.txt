Seven by-elections on 29th November 2018:

<h2>Failsworth East</h2>

Oldham council, Greater Manchester; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Cheryl Brock, who had served since 2016.

We start this week in the east of Greater Manchester, at the point where the big city of Manchester starts to break down into a series of former textile towns.  One of those is Failsworth, which may look like part of Manchester but administratively never has been; instead the ward's council tax ix collected from the concrete carbuncle which is Oldham Civic Centre.  Within the M60, Failsworth lies on the main road and tram line from Manchester to Oldham; the East ward is based on the Hollinwood area next to the motorway, together with the village of Woodhouses where Michael Atherton, the former England captain, learned to play cricket.  Woodhouses lies in open country in the south of the ward, much of which is part of the Daisy Nook country park; at the far end of the ward can be found Hollinwood tram stop on the Oldham branch of the Metrolink network.

Failsworth East ward has appeared in Andrew's Previews a couple of times before, most recently in February 2017 - see pages 34 and 35 of <em>Andrew's Previews 2017</em>, still available from Amazon and a delightful Christmas present for the discerning psephologist. It's normally a safe Labour ward, certainly so in the current political climate; but I have to put a disclaimer in because of the 2008 election here, when the Tories won by eight votes in what appears to be a freak result.  The Conservatives didn't even defend their by-election gain when it came up for re-election in 2012, and the closest Labour have come to losing since was in 2014 when they had a twelve-point lead over UKIP.  By 2016 the Conservatives were back in second place, and in May this year the Labour lead was 53-29.  That was a recovery from the Tory point of view from the 2017 Greater Manchester mayoral election, when Andy Burnham carried this ward 72-22, and from the February 2017 by-election which Labour won 58-25.

That by-election was won by Labour candidate Paul Jacques, and the defending Labour candidate this time round is his wife Elizabeth.  Regular Conservative candidate Antony Cahill returns for his fourth consecutive attempt at the ward.  Also standing are independent candidate Warren Bates, who was elected as a UKIP ccouncillor for the neighbouring Failsworth West ward in 2014 but lost re-election as an independent in May; Stephen Barrow of the Liberal Democrats; and official UKIP candidate Paul Goldring.  From the UKIP point of view that's already an improvement on last week's local by-elections, where there were no UKIP candidates at all.

<h2>Stratford North</h2>

Warwickshire county council; caused by the death of Keith Lloyd, who had been elected for the Stratford First Independents.

Having got our Northern appetiser out of the way, we now come to the main course: a series of interesting by-elections in the Sourh Midlands.  For the first of these we come to Warwickshire and the banks of the Avon.  In Roman times there was a minor road connecting Alcester to the Fosse Way, and this forded the Avon; a village grew up around the ford by the street, and the Norman lord of the manor John of Coutances had big plans for it.  He laid out a new town at the end of the twelfth century, and persuaded Richard the Lionheart to grant a market charter for his new settlement.  And so the town of Stratford-upon-Avon was born.

Stratford's location on the Avon and the Roman Road was a good one, and it benefited from passing trade - particularly so after the completion of the Stratford-upon-Avon Canal which allowed navigation to the heavy industry of Birmingham and the West Midlands.  However, the mainstay of the town's economy today is essentially down to two men who lived a century and a half apart.  The first was William Shakespeare, who was born in 1564 at a house on Henley Street which still stands today; the second was David Garrick, who tapped into an emerging phenomenon of Bardolatry by organising a jubilee celebration of Shakespeare's life in Stratford in September 1769.  And ever since then Stratford has been overrun with tourists attracted here by the Bard of Avon and the Royal Shakespeare Company, which runs three theatres in the town.

Democracy was not a thing in Shakespeare's day, and you don't get
