"All the right votes, but not necessarily in the right order"

There are four by-elections on Thursday 8th November 2018, with three Labour defences and one Conservative:

<hr/>

<h2>Bush Fair; and<br/>
Nettleswell</h2>

Harlow council, Essex; caused respectively by the resignations of Labour councillors Ian Beckett and Waida Forman.  Forman, who was the deputy leader of the council, had served since 2012.  Beckett was first elected in 2011; he resigned from the council after being deselected for the 2019 election.

We have now entered November, which means that there are some notices which have to be read out at this time of year.  First, by the time you read these words your columnist will be out of the country: I'm off to soggy Venice to play in the 2018 European Quiz Championships over the weekend, and will not be reading or doing anything to do with elections until I'm back in the UK next week.  Anybody who's correpsonded with me over the last few months might say "no change there" and unfortunately they are right: I have been extremely busy with work and things have got left or delayed recently.  My apologies to anybody who may have been disappointed by a lack of timely response.

Secondly, we are now less than half a year away from the next ordinary local government elections which are due to take place on Thursday 2nd May 2019.  The six-month rule is now in effect, which means that there will be no by-elections for any new vacancies which occur for council terms which are due to end in 2019.  Since the majority of English local councillors are up for re-election in May 2019, this means that this column is going to get a lot quieter than normal over the next few months.

However, the six-month rule doesn't apply retrospectively, and two of today's four by-elections are for council seats which will be up for re-election again in May.  Whoever wins those polls will not be able to rest on their laurels for long.  One of them is in the Bush Fair ward of the Essex town of Harlow.  Harlow was one of the first New Towns, with construction beginning in the late 1940s to ease overcrowding in bombed-out London; it was designed with a series of neighbourhoods which were intended to be self-supporting, with their own shops, pubs and facilities.  There were also some pre-existing villages incorporated into the town: the village of Tye Green now forms part of the Bush Fair ward, which is a residential area in the south-east of the town either side of Tillwicks Road.  Betraying its New Town origins, over 40% of the local housing is still socially rented, and in the 2011 census Bush Fair made the top 50 wards in England and Wales for those educated to Level 1 standard - that is, 1 to 4 GCSE passes or equivalent.

To the north of Bush Fair is Netteswell ward, which lies immediately east of the town centre and was one of the earlier New Town areas to be developed.  Again, Netteswell was a pre-existing village.  Much of the area of its ward is taken up by the 164 acres of Harlow Town Park, which separates the ward's housing from Harlow Town railway station.

New Towns are often noted for being politically volatile, and Harlow is a case in point.  The Harlow parliamentary constituency has been a bellwether since it was created in 1974, failing to vote for the winning party since then only once (in 1979).  In the May 2017 local elections the Conservatives won all four of Harlow's seats on Essex county council, gaining three of them from Labour; a month later then-junior minister Robert Halfon was easily re-elected as MP for Harlow with a swing against him that was below the national average.  Despite that, Harlow council is a Labour bastion: since coming to power in 2010 the Tories have never won more than five of the town's eleven wards.  Part of that is a boundary effect: a lot of the town's Conservative voters are packed into the two very safe wards of Church Langley and Old Harlow, and the parliamentary seat also includes four reliably-Tory wards outside the town from Epping Forest district.  The effect of this is that after the May 2018 elections Labour had 20 seats on Harlow council with the Conservatives holding the other 13.

That wasn't always the theme, mind.  Both Bush Fair and Netteswell wards returned full slates of Lib Dems in 2002, when the current ward boundaries were drawn up.  Netteswell developed into a three-way marginal while Bush Fair was more of a Labour versus Lib Dem contest.  However, Harlow was one of the places where the Coalition led to the Liberal Democrat vote evaporating, and with the exception of a UKIP win in Bush Fair in 2014 both wards have voted Labour ever since.  Not always safely, though: the Conservatives surged in both wards in May this year, with Labour leading 45-39 in Bush Fair (UKIP polling just 11% and losing their seat) and slightly more comfortably by 51-39 in Netteswell.

Not only that, but there are mutterings coming from Harlow about the influence of Momentum in the town's Labour group.  It seems fairly clear from press reports that Councillor Beckett was deselected in favour of a Momentum-backed candidate, and his is not the only resignation to have been provoked by a clash with that group.  This column will be back in Harlow in December for more on that story, and there are some other vacancies coming up in a similar vein.  See if you can spot them as they come up in Andrew's Previews.

Having defeated Beckett for the Bush Fair Labour nomination, Jodi Dunne now has the chance to become a Harlow councillor rather earlier than she might have expected.  Labour's Dunne is up against the Tories' Andreea Hardware who returns from May's election; she is a recent University of Kent graduate and teaching assistant.  Also standing are Anita Long for UKIP, Lesley Rideout for the Lib Dems and Nicholas Taylor for a new localist outfit, the Harlow Alliance Party.

In Netteswell both major parties have gone for youth in their candidate selection.  Shannon Jezzard defends for Labour; she is a digital marketing adminstrator and another Momentum figure, and at 22 years of age can claim seniority over her Tory opponent.  He is Jake Brackstone, who was just 19 when he fought this ward in May.  Also standing are Mark Gough for UKIP, Robert Thursston for the Lib Dems and Alan Leverett for the Harlow Alliance Party.

<h2>Dormers Wells</h2>

Ealing council, North London; caused by the death of Labour councillor Tej Ram Bagha.  He was first elected in 1994 for Mount Pleasant ward, and had represented Dormers Wells ward since 2006; Bagha was also the Mayor of Ealing in 2014-15.

We move into West London for our final Labour defence of the week.  The Dormers Wells area takes its name from an old farm and watermill called Dorman's Well, which existed before housing was built here either side of the Second World War.  There's still a lot of open space in this area by London standards: the area east of Greenford Road is a park through which the River Brent flows, while the West Middlesex Golf Course and the Greenford Park Cemetery also provide greenery.

The rest of the ward is, however filled with semi-detached houses which have been a focus for immigration from the subcontinent, particularly the Punjab.  Dormers Wells is in the top 10 wards in England and Wales for Sikhism (23% of the population), and also makes the top 100 for those born outside the EU (49%), those holding non-UK qualifications (17%), Hinduism (16%) and Asian ethniciy (58% of the population).  The northern end of the ward, around Greenford Park cemetery, also recorded a high population born in Poland: this is overspill from Greenford, home to one of the UK's longest-establihsed Polish communities.

Dormers Wells is covered by Ealing council, which has swumg a mile to the left since the 2006 election which returned a Tory majority on the council.  This ward was never part of that majority, and is very safe Labour under present conditions.  Bagha had represented Dormers Wells since 2006 at which his running-mates on the Labour slate were Tejinder Singh Dhami and Ranjit Dheer, and all three of them were re-elected in 2010, 2014 and 2018.  That May 2018 election saw their Labour slate beat the Conservatives here 69-16; the 2016 London Assembly elections, with a wider field, saw Sadiq Khan beat Zac Goldsmith in the ward's ballot boxes 65-21 while the Labour list led 68-17 in the London Members ballot.  Finishing ninth in Dormers Wells in the mayoral election was independent candidate Prince Zylinski, a genuine Polish aristocrat who subsequantly founded his own political party: Duma Polska, or Polish Pride to give it its English name, finished last in Dormers Wells this May with 3% of the vote.

Defending for Labour is Mohinda Kaur Midha who is seeking to make a quick return to Ealing council: she represented Lady Margaret ward from 2010 until May.  The Tories have selected Amandeep Gill, who fought Norwood Green ward in May's elections and is making action against flytippers part of his campaign.  Also standing are Meena Hans for the Green Party and Nigel Bakhai for the Lib Dems.

<h2>Holsworthy</h2>

Torridge council, Devon; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Ken Carroll.

For our final contest of the week we escape to the country to consider our Conservative defence.  Holsworthy is a small and remote market town near the north-west corner of Devon; despite having a population comfortably under 3,000 it is a major centre for the local area.  Agriculture is the main economic sector: Holsworthy has one of the largest livestock markets in the West Country, while the slurry produced by the local dairy industry creates renewable energy for the local area via one of the UK's largest anaerobic digestors.  Holsworthy was hit hard by the foot-and-mouth outbreak of 2001, leading to a drive to bring tourists to and diversify the economy of the "Ruby Country"; tha jury may be still out on that one, but in the 2011 census Holwworthy ward did come in the top 100 wards in England and Wales for part-time employment.

A term which might at a stretch be used to describe Holsworthy's two members of Torridge council, none of whom have been re-elected since 2007.  The 2015 election returned two Conservatives, Carroll and Ian Parker, who polled 45% of the vote against 24% for UKIP and 17% for outgoing Lib Dem councillor Howard Ratledge.  Prior to that the Lib Dems had held one of the ward's two seats continuously since 2003, the other seat going to the Tories in 2011 and to independent councillors before that.

A Tory loss would cut their majority on Torridge council to just two seats going into the 2019 elections - following a by-election gain from the Lib Dems in July, they hold 19 seats plus this vacancy against eight independents, three UKIPpers, two Greens, two Lib Dems and a Labour coucnillor.  Their defending candidate is Jon Hutchings, a former Mayor of Holsworthy and landlord of the White Hart in the town.  UKIP haven't returned, and the Lib Dems have selected Christopher Styles-Power who gives an address some distance away in Shebbear, so Hutchings' biggest challenge may come from independent candidate and retired businessman John Allen, who succeeded Hutchings as Mayor of Holsworthy in 2016 and was a former district councillor for this ward in 2003-07.  Completing the ballot paper is Tom Hammett for Labour.
