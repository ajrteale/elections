Before we start this week there are a couple of entries for Correction Corner.  Firstly, this column would like to apologise to Jodi Dunne, the winning Labour candidate in the Harlow, Bush Fair by-election last Thursday; Councillor Dunne is in fact a man ("Jodi" being short for "Joseph") and not, as I had incorrectly assumed and in wrote in last week's column, a woman.  Also, the Dormers Wells by-election last week was not in fact the first by-election in Ealing for ten years; there was a poll in Northfield ward on general election day in 2015 which I had overlooked.   Unfortunately this lack of basic research also fed through into my performance in the European Quiz Championships over the weekend in Venice, with my Wales team finishing tenth out of fifteen nations.  My apologies for the mistakes; must do better in future.

Four by-elections on 15th November 2018:

<h2>Canterbury North</h2>

Kent county council; caused by the death of Conservative councillor John Simmonds.  A long-serving member of Kent county council, Simmonds had entered politics in 2001 after retiring from a career in banking and finance: he put that experience to good use by serving for eight years as Kent's cabinet member for finance, only stepping down shortly before his death.  He also served for twelve years on the council of the University of Kent, and in the 2014 New Year Honours was appointed MBE for services to local government.  He had represented Canterbury North since its creation in 2017, before then sitting for the predecessor division of Canterbury West.

For our first by-election we are in a division whose name may be misleading at first sight.  This is not the northern division of the ancient Kent city of Canterbury; the city does have a northern county division, but that is called Canterbury City North.  The Canterbury North division, by contrast, is almost entirely outside the city and rather diverse.

This division is based on three wards of the Canterbury district.  At the northern end is Chestfield ward, based on a village of the same name and also including part of the town of Whitstable.  To the west of Canterbury lie the villages of Rough Common and Chartham, which are satellite villages for the city; Chartham is in the Stour valley and has a railway station on the Canterbury-Ashford line.  Between them can be found a thickly-wooded area, the Blean Forest, within which is the village of Blean on the Canterbury-Whitstable road; this was the home of Smallfilms, the production company which gave us such classics of children's television as <em>Ivor the Engine</em>, the <em>Clangers</em> and, of course, <em>Bagpuss</em>.

But don't be fooled into thinking that this is a bucolic true-blue ward, even if the 2017 county election result - 55% for the Conservatives, 16% each for Labour and the Lib Dems - might give that impression.  Not all the electors here are old enough to remember <em>Bagpuss</em> - indeed, a sizeable number won't have <em>parents</em> who are old enough to remember <em>Bagpuss</em>.  Canterbury North division contains most of the campus of the University of Kent.  One of the plate glass universities of the 1960s, Kent houses over 6,000 students at its campus on the northern edge of Canterbury.  An early Kent student was a young lad called Gavin Esler, who graduated in 1974 with a BA in English and American literature; Esler subsequently worked for forty years as a BBC journalist, and is now the chancellor of the university he once studied at.  His predecessor as chancellor was one of the UK's most eminent psephologists, the opinion pollster and founder of MORI Sir Robert Worcester.

The university certainly has a large impact on the electoral roll here.  Both county and district ward boundaries have changed here since the 2011 census, but at the time Blean Forest ward (which covers the campus together with Blean) was 70% student, the eighth-highest figure for any ward in England and Wales; in consequence it was in the top fifteen wards in the country for the 18-29 age group and for those educated to A-level but no further.  It would appear that the students generally didn't turn out for the Kent county council election in May 2017, but they must have turned out for the snap general election five weeks later; the Labour gain of the Canterbury constituency, which had returned Conservatives or Independent Conservatives continuously since 1857, was one of the most surprising results of last year.  In order for Labour to have won Canterbury last year they must have most likely carried this county division.  Suddenly that 55-16 Tory lead in May 2017 doesn't look all that safe.  However, it will be difficult for Labour to repeat that trick for a local election; the campus electoral roll has turned over twice since then and very few of the 2017 students will still be living within the division boundaries.

Defending for the Conservatives is a latter-day Thomas of Canterbury: Robert Thomas is an accountant who since 2011 has been a Canterbury city councillor, representing Chartham and Stone Street ward.  Labour have gone for somebody with excellent connections to their core electorate in the division: Dr Ben Hickman is a senior lecturer in poetry at the University of Kent.  The Lib Dems, who were just one vote behind Labour at the 2017 county elections, have selected Alex Lister who works in digital communications and is a governor of the local NHS hospital trust: he is campaigning strongly for a new hospital for Canterbury.  Also standing are teacher Henry Stanton for the Greens (who was their parliamentary candidate here last year), University of Kent student Joe Simons for UKIP and independent candidate Joe Egerton, who was a Conservative candidate for Canterbury City South in last year's county elections.
