Three by-elections on Thursday 7th June 2018, all Conservative defences:

<br/>

<h2>Cranmore</h2>

Mid Devon council; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Clarissa Slade who had served since 2015.

A few weeks ago I wrote in this column about the difficulties facing extremely young councillors in the context of the UK's most millennial ward, covering the Lancaster University campus.  There was a double by-election there, with one of the outgoing councillors, Lucy Atkinson, having been elected to Lancaster city council in 2015 as an 18-year-old first year student.  Her resignation statement made clear just how difficult it is to juggle the demands of elected office with being a full-time student while in poor health.  That didn't stop her being - according to her political opponents - an excellent representative for her student electorate, and I hope Atkinson goes on to make every success of her career.

Clarissa Slade was born on 25th February 1997, and was elected to Mid Devon district council and Tiverton town council on 7th May 2015 at the age of 18 years and 71 days.  It's always difficult to keep track of these things, but she was reported at the time to be the UK's youngest councillor.  The following September Clarissa accepted a place reading Classics at the University of Winchester, and combined her studies and life in Winchester with her democratic duties in Devon and with starting to follow the traditional career path for someone who wants to get noticed and climb the greasy pole.  The local MP, Neil Parish, talked of her drive, ambition and hard work, commenting that politics ran in her blood and veins - appropriate given that Clarissa's parents are both councillors themselves.  Councillor Colin Slade, her father, said that her long-term ambition was to be Prime Minister.  By all accounts, she was going the right way about it.

On 26th March 2018, councillor Clarissa Slade was found dead at her university home in Winchester.  She was 21 years old and in the third year of her degree, and reportedly had been awaiting the results of heart tests.  Her death was widely reported at the time because of her age - she is, by a very long way, the youngest councillor whose death has been marked by this column.  (The previous record holder was a Tory-turned-UKIP member of South Tyneside council, who died in 2013 at the age of 30 after a life and career blighted by alcoholism.  Compare and contrast.)  I'll leave the final word to Clarissa's father Colin: "who knows what she could have achieved"?

Clarissa Slade's ward was Cranmore, the south-eastern of the four wards covering the town of Tiverton, running from the banks of the Exe along the Grand Western Canal.  The ward name recalls Cranmore Castle, an Iron Age earthwork which overlooks the town.  The 2011 census picked up a significant Polish community close to the town centre, while manufacturing and administration are important industries.

Located about fifteen miles north of Exeter, Tiverton grew thanks to textiles, and one of Cranmore ward's thoroughfares - Heathcoat Way - recalls the industrialist John Heathcoat.  Heathcoat came to Tiverton to escape Luddite attacks on his previous Derbyshire base, and brought with him a lace-making industry.

That local influence enabled Heathcoat to become one of the Whig MPs for Tiverton, which even after the 1832 Reform Act was a notorious rotten borough.  A flavour of this can be found in the 1847 election here, in which Heathcoat's running-mate was none other than the foreign secretary Lord Palmerston.  Palmerston's re-election was challenged by the Chartist leader George Julian Harney, who according to Friedrich Engels won the hustings on a show of hands.  But Palmerston called for a ballot; Harney, knowing he had no chance of winning on the borough's electorate, was forced to withdraw.

Things are a bit different here these days, of course.  Cranmore ward is traditionally a Lib Dem-Tory fight: the Lib Dems won all three seats here in 2007, but lost one to the Conservatives in 2011.  One of the remaining Lib Dem councillors, Kevin Wilson, was then found guilty of benefit fraud and ended up with a 10-week suspended prison sentence - not long enough to disqualify him from office and he stood for re-election in 2015 as an independent.  The Lib Dems didn't defend their remaining seat in the ward and the way was clear for the Conservatives to pick up all three seats in the 2015 election.  The Tory slate had 47% of the vote, but a lot of that was a personal vote for their outgoing councillor Sue Griggs who topped the poll; Slade was elected in third place with a majority of just 35 votes over independent candidate Leslie Cruwys who had 31%.  Wilson finished fifth, ahead of the Labour slate which polled 23%.  It would appear that Wilson is back in the Lib Dem fold now, not that that did him much good - he was their defending candidate for the local Tiverton East division in the 2017 Devon county elections, but the Tories' Colin Slade gained the seat from the Lib Dems by the margin of 42-30.

In defending this by-election the Tories have turned from youth to experience.  Their candidate Lance Kennedy is a former police officer who served four times as Mayor of Bodmin in Cornwall; he was a Cornwall councillor for Bodmin East division from 2009 to 2013 and sat on the council's cabinet.  Even more experienced is Leslie Cruwys, who was first elected in 1972 to the former Tiverton urban district council; he was runner-up here in the 2015 election, has since been co-opted to Tiverton town council and this time is standing with the Lib Dem nomination.  Another town councillor and independent candidate returning is Steve Bush, who finished last here in 2015 and this time is the Labour candidate.

<h2>Benson and Crowmarsh</h2>

South Oxfordshire council; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Richard Pullen who had served since 2015.  He resigned due to political differences with Jane Murphy, who has recently taken over as leader of the council's Conservative group.

For our south-eastern by-election we are in rural Oxfordshire on the left bank of the River Thames.  Benson is a village with a lot of history: there are prehistoric remains here, and it was first attested in 573 when the West Saxons established here a royal vill - an administrative centre for the local area.  The village was surrendered to Offa of Mercia in the 770s, and by the time of the 1086 Domesday survey Benson was the richest royal manor in Oxfordshire.  Charles I held court here during the Civil War, and in the eighteenth century Benson was an important staging post on the route from London to Oxford.  The coming of the railway, which bypassed the area, led to economic and population decline; but Benson these days is a commuter village for the Oxfordshire towns, with professional and scientific occupations being strongly represented.

However, that's not the main industry here.  Included within the ward is RAF Benson, opened in 1939 shortly before the outbreak of war and still very much in Air Force use today.  The airfield saw much action in the war, and Polish and Czechoslovak airmen who were based here are buried in the village churchyard.  That church has a clock tower with a clockface that shows two number 11s (the number 9 was mispainted as "XI") and during the war the broadcaster and passport fraudster William Joyce promised an airraid on "an airfield near the village whose clock had two elevens".  RAF Benson was duly bombed shortly afterwards.  Away from military use, Benson is in a frost hollow and regularly records unusually low temperatures.

This ward was created in 2015, being based on the former two-seat Benson ward which had rather different boundaries.  The 2015 result showed large personal votes for Conservative councillor Felix Bloomfield, who topped the poll, and Lib Dem Susan Cooper who is a former district councillor for Benson ward; both ran a long way ahead of their respective running-mates.  The vote shares - 47% for the Conservatives, 30% for the Lib Dems, 13% for the Greens - should probably be seen in that context.  Not that the Tories have it all their own way here: at Oxfordshire county level most of the ward is within the Benson and Cholsey division, which elected an independent county councillor in 2017.  

Defending or the Conservatives is Domenic Papa, from Benson.  The Lib Dem candidate is the aforementioned Sue Cooper who was runner-up here in 2015.  There is no Green candidate this time, so completing the ballot paper is Labour's William Sorenson.
