Sacha Baron Cohen has a lot to answer for.  It's almost twenty years now (God, that makes me feel old) since <em>The 11 O'Clock Show</em> first aired on Channel 4, bringing the character of Ali G to our screens.  For those who are too young, old or uncool to remember Ali G, his shtick was to conduct a series of interviews, like the one above, with public figures and well known celebrities with the intention of getting them to say or do something stupid.  Despite the fact that his victims over the years have included several prominent Americans, including a rather younger pre-political version of Donald Trump, it would appear that the American political class has learned nothing from the Ali G experience.  Baron Cohen has been up to his old tricks recently for his new show <em>Who Is America</em>, prompting several prominent politicians and Sarah Palin to try and get their excuses, fake news or outrage in early.

Outrage, fake or otherwise, is of course a reaction which Baron Cohen will be used to.  The Kazakh government were distinctly unimpressed with the mauling their country got at the hands of Borat.  Closer to home, the town of Grimsby got the treatment in 2016 with the release of a film where Bahon Cohen played a football hooligan.  Grimsby got poor reviews and was a financial failure; rather like the film, then.

Now, writing negative things about Grimsby is a bit like shooting fish in a barrel.  But please don't do that, the town needs the money it can get from processing and selling the fish.  This is still an industrial town with all sorts of intractable geographical and structural problems.  Together with its twin town of Cleethorpes, Grimsby forms the largest urban area in Lincolnshire; but it's administratively cut off from Lincoln by the fact that it was part of the old Humberside county when that existed.  For a location in England Grimsby is surprisingly remote: there is one good road in and out, the A180 the west, but Hull is over thirty miles away over the Humber Bridge, Doncaster fifty miles away.  The landscape is featureless and the only thing bringing tourist money is the beach at Cleethorpes, which is not the holiday draw it once was.  The main industry is fish and fish processing, which is a bit of a problem giving the decline in North Sea fish stocks, the Common Fisheries Policy and the loss of the Cod Wars with Iceland.  Other industries are not doing well either: the Tioxide chemical plant, which dominated the seafront on the north-west corner of the town, ceased operation in 2009 and Associated British Ports, who now own the site, are apparently turning it into an enormous car park for vehicle imports and exports.  Add all this together and you end up with a town in serious decline, with some of the UK's most deprived neighbourhoods and cheapest property.

The Tioxide chemical plant/car park forms the northern end of Grimsby's Freshney ward.  The name comes from the River Freshney, which forms its southern boundary and which emptied into the Humber here until the eighteenth century, when the river was diverted into Grimsby harbour.  The ward which the Freshney gives its name to is based on Great Coates, a former village at the western end of Grimsby which was incorporated into the town in 1968 and which has expanded greatly since then.  This is a socially divided ward, with the Wybers Wood estate at the south-west end being a very desirable area.

As an electoral unit Freshney ward has unchanged boundaries since 1981, when it was formed as a Humberside county council division.  The division and later ward was safe Labour until 2003, since when it has been extremely volatile: in the last fifteen years Freshney has elected councillors from all three main parties and UKIP.

As stated, the fun started in 2003 the Tories and Lib Dems formed an electoral pact to oust the Labour administration in North East Lincolnshire.  It was devastatingly effective: across the district that year Labour had 29.9% of the vote, the Tories 29.8% and the Lib Dems 29.3%, but Labour won only seven out of 42 seats to 16 for the Conservatives and 13 for the Lib Dems.  Isn't first-past-the-post wonderful?  Three of those Conservatives were elected in Freshney ward, but Labour took two of the Tory seats back in 2004 and 2006.

In 2007 the anti-Labour pact broke down, the Lib Dems started to contest Freshney, and the ward immediately became a very tight three-way marginal.  From nowhere in 2006 the Lib Dems gained the remaining Tory seat in 2007 and took a seat off Labour in 2008 for good measure.  
The early 2010s were good for Labour, who picked up the Lib Dem seats in 2011 and 2012 - the winner in 2012 was the Lib Dem councillor elected in 2008, who had defected.

But then UKIP made their big breakthrough in Grimsby.  The party topped the poll across North East Lincolnshire district in 2014, and won seven of the fifteen seats up for election.  That led to speculation that the Kippers could gain the Great Grimsby parliamentary seat in the forthcoming general election; but it didn't work out like that.  UKIP instead fell back and Labour held Freshney quite easily in both 2015 and 2016.

But there is one final twist in the tale here.  In May's ordinary election the UKIP seat was up and it was duly lost - not to Labour but to the Conservatives, who won a seat in Freshney for the first time since 2006.  Shares of the vote were 45% for the Conservatives and 41% for Labour.  It was one of seven seats the Tories gained in May's election across the district.

Just in case you thought it couldn't get any more interesting, this by-election could be crucial for control of North East Lincolnshire council.  Going into the poll Labour and the Conservatives are tied on 18 seats each, with four Lib Dems and an independent holding the balance of power.  (UKIP were wiped out in May's election.)  Whoever out of Labour and the Tories wins this by-election will become the largest group on the council; and if the Conservatives gain the seat they may seek to oust North East Lincolnshire's minority Labour administration.

So, high stakes.  Defending for Labour is Sheldon Mill, an NHS accountant who finished second in Park ward in May's election.  The Tories' Steve Holland, a former ship's captain, will be hoping that the recent blue wave in Grimsby will carry him to victory.  Also standing are Barry Fisher for UKIP, Loyd Emmerson for the Green Party and independent candidate Mick Kiff, who is the only candidate to live in the ward.
