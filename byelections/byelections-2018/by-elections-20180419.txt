Before we start the week, I have a special announcement to make.

<h2>Andrew's Previews 2017</h2>

Last year, I saw fit to publish these Previews as a printed book.  <em>Andrew's Previews 2016</em> seems to have gone down well.  Its Amazon reviewer described it as "one of those books, like the Nuffield Foundation volumes on British general elections, that makes you wonder how we managed before they came along".  Well, I suppose I was taking a risk in publishing something which had literally never been done before in print.  Despite my complete lack of self-publicity skills, <em>Andrew's Previews 2016</em> has crawled up to my sales target; and the feedback has persuaded me that the exercise is worth doing again.

So, here's the follow-up that at least some people have been eagerly waiting for.  Available now from Amazon, <em>Andrew's Previews 2017</em> is another collection of the by-election previews from that volatile political year which was 2017, plus some bonus material.

If you would like to relive the year of the snap general election as it unfolded, while learning a bit about the geography and history of Great Britain, this book is for you.  And by buying the book, you will help to support the research required for future previews - while having a permanent and (hopefully) positive reminder of your donation.

To give you a flavour of what's in the book, have a look at the rest of this post, in which we discuss the three councils by-elections on 19th April 2018.  These will be the last polls before the ordinary May 2018 elections, and they are all Conservative defences.  But by no means are they all the same...

<h2>Thatcham West</h2>

West Berkshire council; caused by the disqualification of Conservative councillor Nick Goodes, who failed to attend any council meetings in six months.  He had served since 2015.

We start this week in the M4 corridor.  Thatcham is one of those towns which has been a bit overlooked; its population isn't that much smaller than Newbury, which adjoins it to the west, but Thatcham is far less well-known.  It could have all been so different.  This area has been inhabited since prehistoric times - Mesolithic remains dating from the eighth and ninth millennia BC have been found in the area - and as late as the fourteenth century AD Thatcham was a larger and more important town than Newbury.  The location was good, on one of the main lines of communication through southern England: the River Kennet and the Berks and Hants railway line form the southern boundary of West ward, the A4 London-Bath road bisects the ward, as did a Roman road; and the M4 motorway is just to the north.

What did for Thatcham was the Black Death, which hit the town hard in 1348 and led to Newbury overtaking it in importance.  Nonetheless Thatcham has seen large population grownth since the Second World War.  It is the location of the Motor Insurance Repair Research Centre, which analyses cars and their security systems for the insurance industry, giving out Thatcham ratings for car alarms, immobilisers and suchlike.  Thatcham is also about to go onto the sporting map: the local non-league side Thatcham Town FC, who play five divisions below the Football League n the Hellenic League Premier Division, will be going to Wembley next month, playing Stockton Town in the final of the FA Vase.

This is not a longstanding Conservative ward.  The Newbury constituency was a famous Liberal Democrat by-election win in 1993, and the party held that parliamentary seat until 2005.  Thatcham West was a stronger Lib Dem area than the seat as a whole, and it took until 2015 for the Conservatives to gain it: the Tory lead that year was 48-39 over the Lib Dems.  West Berkshire is a unitary council so there are no clues to be gained from last year's county elections.  The Lib Dems did get a small swing in their favour in the 2017 general election across the Newbury constituency, from which the party might take some encouragement in their attempt to get this seat back.

Both the Tories and Lib Dems have selected candidates with high local profiles.  Defending for the Conservatives is Ellen Crumly, the Mayor of Thatcham.  The Lib Dem candidate Jeff Brooks wants his seat back: he was a Lib Dem councillor for this ward from 2003 until losing to the Conservatives in 2015, and his local government career goes all the way back to 1995 when he was elected to the former Newbury district council.  Also standing are Louise Coulson for Labour, Gary Johnson for UKIP and Jane Livermore for the Green Party.

<h2>Lymm South</h2>

Warrington council; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Sheila Woodyatt at the age of 80.  The Mayor of Warrington in 2000-01, and at one point the only Conservative councillor in the borough, Woodyatt had served on Warrington council since 1983, being elected for Lymm ward until boundary changes in 2016.  She also represented Lymm on Cheshire county council from 1989 to 1998.  In the 2000 Birthday Honours Woodyatt was appointed MBE for services to the community in Cheshire.

Your columnist likes Lymm.  This is one of those leafy Cheshire villages where the great, the good and the rich of north-west England tend to live; Lymm's list of famous residents includes a large number of well-known actors, footballers and entertainers.  The village centre is in an attractive sandstone gorge running down from the Bridgewater Canal, which forms the northern boundary of this ward, and it's full of the sort of shops and cafés which clearly take as their target market the average Cheshire housewife.

The census bears this out.  A majority of Lymm's workforce are in some sort of professional or managerial role, and the proportion of the population with degrees is very high.  This is the sort of demographic profile that wouldn't look out of place in Wilmslow, Prestbury, Hale Barns, Knutsford or other places frequented by the Real Housewives of Cheshire; but by a quirk of boundaries Lymm, unlike the rest of those places, has ended up in the Borough of Warrington and in the parliamentary seat of Warrington South.  This is a key marginal which has changed hands between the Tories and Labour three times since it was created for the 1983 election; the 2017 election here was one of those Labour gains which looked so unlikely at the start of the snap election campaign.

The present Lymm South ward was created only in 2016; before then there was a single Lymm ward covering the whole of the village.  That ward had been split between Woodyatt and two Liberal Democrat councillors continuously since 1995, and as Warrington moved to the thirds electoral system when it became a unitary council that implies that all the councillors had developed personal votes.  It wasn't until 2015, the last election to the old Lymm ward, that the Tories knocked out one of the Liberal Democrat councillors to make the split 2-1 in their favour.

The two Conservative councillors both successfully sought re-election in the new Lymm South ward in 2016, but the Lib Dems ran them close; shares of the vote were 38% for the Tories, 32% for the Lib Dems and 19% for Labour.  Warrington has moved away from the thirds electoral cycle, so the next borough elections will be in 2020.

Defending for the Tories is Stephen Taylor, who is retired after 40 years with the Environment Agency; he has briefly been a Warrington councillor, representing Stockton Heath ward from 2015 to 2016.  Taylor is a member of Walton parish council and lives in Stockton Heath.  The Lib Dems have selected Anna Fradgley, deputy chairman of Lymm parish council.  The Labour candidate is Trish Cockayne, a volunteer with the Warrington Foodbank and local resident.  Also standing are Derek Ashington for UKIP and Michael Wass for the Green Party.

There is one more vacancy to note this week.  Tony Boyce had recently resigned as Conservative councillor for <em>Moreton and Fyfield</em> ward, a village-based ward in the Epping Forest district of Essex.  A by-election had been called for 3rd May; but when nominations closed the Tories' Ian Hadley was the only candidate, and he has therefore been declared elected without a contest.  This column sends its congratulations to Councillor Hadley.

There will be no Andrew's Previews next week as there are no by-elections next week.  However, it is intended that there will be a double issue in advance of the 3rd May elections, so stay tuned.
