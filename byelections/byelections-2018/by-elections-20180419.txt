Before we start the week, I have a special announcement to make.

<h2>Andrew's Previews 2017</h2>

Last year, I saw fit to publish these Previews as a printed book.  <em>Andrew's Previews 2016</em> seems to have gone down well.  Its Amazon reviewer described it as "one of those books, like the Nuffield Foundation volumes on British general elections, that makes you wonder how we managed before they came along".  Well, I suppose I was taking a risk in publishing something which had literally never been done before in print.  Despite my complete lack of self-publicity skills, <em>Andrew's Previews 2016</em> has crawled up to my sales target; and the feedback has persuaded me that the exercise is worth doing again.

So, here's the follow-up that at least some people have been eagerly waiting for.  Available now from Amazon, <em>Andrew's Previews 2017</em> is another collection of the by-election previews from that volatile political year which was 2017, plus some bonus material.

If you would like to relive the year of the snap general election as it unfolded, while learning a bit about the geography and history of Great Britain, this book is for you.  And by buying the book, you will help to support the research required for future previews - while having a permanent and (hopefully) positive reminder of your donation.

To give you a flavour of what's in the book, have a look at the rest of this post, in which we discuss the three councils by-elections on 19th April 2018.  These will be the last polls before the ordinary May 2018 elections, and they are all Conservative defences.  But by no means are they all the same...
