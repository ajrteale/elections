I don't make any apology for starting this week with the Yorkshire stereotype of a brass band.  I like this sort of stuff, and so - it appears - do the residents of Skelmanthorpe where they've been playing brass for generations.  The Skelmanthorpe band is celebrating its 175th anniversary this year, making it one of the oldest brass ensembles in the country.  Skelmanthorpe are not in the top rank of banding - they compete in the First Section, which is one below the top or Championship Section - but I think you'll agree from listening to this that their quality is excellent nonetheless.

Particularly so given their catchment: an obscure village of around 3,000 souls in the hills some miles to the east of Huddersfield, which is perhaps best known as the birthplace of the current Doctor Who, Jodie Whittaker.  Skelmanthorpe doesn't even merit a parish of its own: along with Clayton West, a settlement of similar size, it's included in the parish of Denby Dale.

These are all villages on or close to the River Dearne that greatly expanded in population due to the Industrial Revolution.  Although Denby Dale is known for its giant pies - the tenth and most recent one, baked in 2000 to celebrate the Millennium, served 22,000 people - the main industry here in the upper Dearne valley was not food but textiles, with some coalmining in Clayton West and Emley to throw into the mix.  Emley may be a fairly tiny village, but anybody from Yorkshire can tell you where it is thanks to this thing on the horizon:

That's the UK's tallest freestanding structure, the Emley Moor tower, which broadcasts television signals to the whole of Yorkshire.

To some extent you have to wonder how a place as small-town as this ended up in a Metropolitan Borough.  There are no good roads connecting the ward to anywhere else; the main railway connection is the little-used Penistone Line to Huddersfield, Barnsley and Sheffield.  Nonetheless this area comes under the jurisdiction of Kirklees council - based in Huddersfield - and is part of the Dewsbury constituency.  This is a marginal parliamentary seat which was a Tory gain in 2010 but which Labour recovered in 2015 against the national trend.  And you can see that Labour recovery written in the annual election results for Denby Dale, which was a Tory ward - mostly reasonably comfortably - until 2010 and then turned into a key marginal.  Labour gained the ward by 85 votes in 2012 and held that gain in 2016, but so far haven't been able to pick up the other two Tory seats.  Billy Jewitt was first elected in May in succession to long-serving Tory councillor Jim Dodds; he beat the Labour candidate by 47% to 43%, a majority of 237 votes.  A Labour gain here will improve the party's small majority on Kirklees council where they currently hold 37 out of 69 seats, with the Conservatives forming the official opposition on 18 (plus this vacancy).

So, this is one to watch for the national picture.  Defending for the Conservatives is Paula Kemp, a Denby Dale parish councillor (for Emley warD) who has lived in the ward for 25 years.  In a clash of the generations Labour have reselected their candidate from May Will Simpson, a 21-year-old from Clayton West who worked on the 2015 Labour election campaign for Dewsbury despite being too young to vote at the time.  Also standing are Isabel Walters for the Green Party and Alison Baskeyfield for the Lib Dems.
