I don't make any apology for starting this week with the Yorkshire stereotype of a brass band.  I like this sort of stuff, and so - it appears - do the residents of Skelmanthorpe where they've been playing brass for generations.  The Skelmanthorpe band is celebrating its 175th anniversary this year, making it one of the oldest brass ensembles in the country.  Skelmanthorpe are not in the top rank of banding - they compete in the First Section, which is one below the top or Championship Section - but I think you'll agree from listening to this that their quality is excellent nonetheless.

Particularly so given their catchment: an obscure village of around 3,000 souls in the hills on the wrong side of the Pennines, which is perhaps best known as the birthplace of the current Doctor Who, Jodie Whittaker.  Skelmanthorpe doesn't even merit a parish of its own: along with Clayton West, a settlement of similar size, it's included in the parish of Denby Dale.

These are all villages on or close to the River Dearne that greatly expanded in population due to the Industrial Revolution.  Although Denby Dale is known for its giant pies - the tenth and most recent one, baked in 2000 to celebrate the Millennium, served 22,000 people - the main industry here in the upper Dearne valley was not food but textiles, with some coalmining in Clayton West and Emley to throw into the mix.  Emley may be a fairly tiny village, but anybody from the West Riding can tell you where it is thanks to this thing on the horizon:

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e1/Emley_Moor_mast_at_sunset_-_geograph.org.uk_-_497294.jpg" />

That's the UK's tallest freestanding structure, the Emley Moor tower, which broadcasts television signals to the whole of Yorkshire.

To some extent you have to wonder how a place as small-town as this ended up in a Metropolitan Borough.  There are no good roads connecting the ward to anywhere else; the main railway connection is the little-used Penistone Line to Huddersfield, Barnsley and Sheffield.  Nonetheless this area comes under the jurisdiction of Kirklees council - based in Huddersfield, ten miles to the north-west - and is part of the Dewsbury constituency.  This is a marginal parliamentary seat which was a Tory gain in 2010 but which Labour recovered in 2015 against the national trend.  And you can see that Labour recovery written in the annual election results for Denby Dale, which was a Tory ward - mostly reasonably comfortably - until 2010 and then turned into a key marginal.  Labour gained the ward by 85 votes in 2012 and held that gain in 2016, but so far haven't been able to pick up the other two Tory seats.  Billy Jewitt was first elected in May in succession to long-serving Tory councillor Jim Dodds; he beat the Labour candidate by 47% to 43%, a majority of 237 votes.  A Labour gain here will improve the party's small majority on Kirklees council where they currently hold 37 out of 69 seats, with the Conservatives forming the official opposition on 18 (plus this vacancy).

So, this is one to watch because it might tell us something about the national picture in these unstable political times.  Defending for the Conservatives is Paula Kemp, a Denby Dale parish councillor (for Emley warD) who has lived in the ward for 25 years.  In a clash of the generations Labour have reselected their candidate from May Will Simpson, a 21-year-old from Clayton West who worked on the 2015 Labour election campaign for Dewsbury despite being too young to vote at the time.  Also standing are Isabel Walters for the Green Party and Alison Baskeyfield for the Lib Dems.

<h2>Dodington</h2>

South Gloucestershire council; caused by the death of Liberal Democrat councillor Gloria Stephen who had served since 2015.

<blockquote>
"Y is for Yate, the kind of town that referees come from."

We come from small town to large town.  Yate is one of the largest towns you've probably never heard of, with a population of over 35,000: it has absorbed the better-known settlement of Chipping Sodbury and partially spilled over the town boundary into the neighbouring parish of Dodington.  This quasi-New Town development is the area which comprises Dodington ward; essentially one of the four wards covering Yate and Sodbury, Dodington ward should not be confused with the village of the same name, which is some miles away and in a different ward.

Most of Dodington ward was developed in the 1970s when Yate was growing strongly as a commuter and overspill town for Bristol.  The place could have become even bigger: just outside the ward boundary is the Road to Nowhere, a dual carriageway which has never been finished because there was no money to take it over the railway line.  With the Road to Nowhere being still unfinished, Dodington ward is rather cut off from the outside world but nonetheless has some unusual demographics.  In the 2011 census it was number 9 of all the wards in England and Wales for those with 1 to 4 GCSE passes or equivalent, and number 20 for those with 5 or more GCSE passes but nothing higher.  It makes the top 100 wards in England and Wales for part-time employment (18.25% of the workforce) and also scores highly for full-time employment.

Presumably most of those jobs are in the big city of Bristol, since Yate's traditional insdustries were winding down around the time of the town's expansion.  Those industries were an aircraft factory next to the railway station (which is still going but now makes white goods rather than aircraft) and a mine which at its height supplied 95% of the world's supply of celestine.  Celestine is one of the major sources of the metal strontium, which you're probably seeing a lot of at the moment: strontium is the material which burns red in fireworks.

The fireworks of the political variety in Dodington tend to burn not red but yellow.  Yate was named in a parliamentary seat for the first time in 2010 with the creation of the Thornbury and Yate constituency: that seat was won easily in 2010 by the Liberal Democrats' Steve Webb, who subsequently entered government as the minister responsible for pensions in the Coalition.  The Lib Dems had a stranglehold on most of the seats in the constituency, and Dodington swung strongly towards them in the 2011 local elections and a September 2012 by-election, in which the Tories fell to fourth place behind UKIP.  UKIP were still ahead of the Conservatives in Dodington at the 2015 local elections, where the Lib Dems polled 41% to 24% for UKIP and 23% for the Tories; however, on the same day Steve Webb lost his seat to the Conservatives, and in the snap general election two years later there was a further big swing to the blue team.  There have been no local elections in South Gloucestershire since 2015, so it remains to be seen in what shape the Lib Dem machine is in after that sort of reverse.

Defending for the Liberal Democrats is a candidate notable enough to merit her own Wikipedia page, although you'd have a hard time finding it.  Louise Bloom's elected career started in 2000 when she was a founder member of the Greater London Authority; she resigned from the GLA less than two years later and shortly afterwards turned up on Eastleigh council in Hampshire.  Bloom served for fifteen years on that council, including in the council's cabinet, and for a time was in a relationship with the Eastleigh council leader Keith House.  That didn't end well: following health problems, a police warning for harassment and controversy over missing nine consecutive cabiet meetings, Bloom resigned from Eastleigh council in 2017.  She has now returned to her native West Country and to her maiden name of Louise Harris.   Harris was co-opted to Dodington parish council in July and works for a charity that supports adults with learning disabilities.  UKIP have not returned but the Tories have, and they have been making hay over that personal history as you might expect; their candidate is Ian Livermoe who, like Harris, gives an address in Chipping Sodbury.  Completing the ballot paper is the only local resident on the ballot paper, RAF veteran and retired IT technician John Malone who has the Labour nomination.
