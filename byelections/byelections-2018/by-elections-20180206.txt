One by-election on Tuesday 6th February 2018:

<hr/>

<h2>Alyn and Deeside</h2>

National Assembly for Wales; caused by the death of Labour AM Carl Sargeant at the age of 49.  Sargeant had represented Alyn and Deeside in the Assembly since 2003 and had served among the Welsh Ministers since 2007, originally as Chief Whip and latterly as Cabinet Secretary for Communities and Children.  Sargeant was suepended from that position on 3 November 2017, following unspecified allegations about his personal conduct in the febrile atmosphere of the 2017 Westminster sexual scandals.  Four days later, he was found hanged at his home, and the coroner heard that he was believed to have taken his own life.  He leaves behind a wife, a son and a daughter.
