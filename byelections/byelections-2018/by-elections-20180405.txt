Four by-elections on 5th April 2018:

<h2>Milford</h2>

New Forest council, Hampshire; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Sophie Beeton, who had served since winning a by-election in July 2012.  She was New Forest's cabinet member for the environment from 2015 until stepping down late last year, and had been a Milton-on-Sea parish councillor since before she was elected to the district council.

One of England's largest second-tier districts by population, New Forest district may be named after ancient woodland but that's not typical of where most of its residents live.  New Forest's council taxpayers are instead concentrated in the Southampton suburb of Totton, towns on the Solent coast such as Hythe and Lymington, and a retirement belt on the Channel coast centred on New Milton, which is to all intents and purposes an extension of the Bournemouth-Poole conurbation.  Just off the eastern end of that conurbation is the village of Milton-on-Sea, and beyond that is the southernmost point of Hampshire: Hurst Castle, on a narrow spit of land which juts out into the sea and marks the western end of the Solent.  If you don't fancy walking along the spit, then during the tourist season you can catch a boat to the Castle from the village of Keyhaven.

Keyhaven and Hurst Castle are within the New Forest National Park, but Milford-on-Sea is outside it.  Milford-on-Sea gives its name to a ward which includes Keyhaven, Hurst Castle and a small part of the village of Everton.  A major employer within the ward was once Horticulture Research International, an arm of DEFRA, which ran the Efford Horticultural Research Station; the site closed in 2004 due to privatisation, but is still in horticultural use as a nursery.

I described this area as a retirement belt, and the census return makes clear that this is indeed an elephant's graveyard.  Milford ward is in the top 15 wards in England and Wales for residents aged 65 or over (43% of the population), and in the top 30 for retirement (33% of the workforce).  Those here who are young enough to work tend to have well-paid jobs.

Poltically you won't be surprised from that description to hear that this is a true blue ward.  In the 2015 election the Tory slate here polled 80% against opposition only from a single Labour candidate.  The Conservatives were similarly untroubled in last year's county election, in which they polled 77% across the cumborsomely-named division of New Milton North, Milford and Hordle.

There's a wider choice in this by-election, although local resident and Conservative candidate Christine Hopkins would have to be a short-priced favourite.  She is opposed by Sally Spicer for Labour and Lib Dem candidate Wynford Davies.

Previous New Forest poll 19 July 2012

MILFORD, New Forest district council, Hampshire; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Michael Pemberton.

Milford ward includes Hampshire's southernmost point at Hurst Castle, on a spit of land marking the western end of the Solent.  For those who don't fancy the walk along the spit a ferry service to the castle is available in season from the touristy fishing hamlet of Keyhaven.  Keyhaven and Hurst Castle are within the New Forest National Park, but the village of Milford on Sea, a seaside retirement village which is the largest settlement within Milford ward, is not.  The ward includes the whole of Milford-on-Sea parish together with a small part of the neighbouring village of Everton, including the former Efford Horticultural Research Station, now a nursery.

This ward is even safer for the Conservatives than Queen's ward above, the most recent result being a 79-21 win in a straight fight with a single Labour candidate in 2011.  The Tories defeated a single Liberal Democrat candidate by the same score in 2007.

The Conservatives have selected Milton-on-Sea parish councillor Sophie Beeton as their candidate in the by-election; she is opposed by Labour candidate Caroline Hexter, a nursery school teacher from New Milton.

<h2>Wiveliscombe and West Deane</h2>

Taunton Deane council, Somerset; caused by the resignation of independent councillor Steve Ross, who had served since 2011, due to work commitments.

We move into the West Country for a bit of a view.  With an altitude of 413 feet, Wiveliscombe (stressed on the third syllable) claims to be Somerset's highest town, although "town" is a bit of a stretch for a settlement of fewer than 3,000 souls.  Nonetheless this is a rather isolated part of southern England - Taunton, the main town in the area, is nine miles away along a B-road - and Wiveliscombe does function as a service centre for the parishes at the western end of the Vale of Taunton Deane.  A rather tautological name there, as "Deane" is an Old English word with the same meaning as "Vale".  So has "combe" for that matter; "combe" is a Celtic word for a valley.  Four parishes from the Vale (or Deane, or Combe) are included in this ward, making up its West Deane component.

Wiveliscombe traditionally sends independent candidates to Taunton Deane council.  In the 2015 election the independent slate polled 39%, to 32% for the single Conservative candidate and 16% for the Liberal Democrats.  For a clue as to what might happen here without an independent candidate on the ballot we need to go up a tone to county level; the ward is part of the Upper Tone division of Somerset county council, which has been Conservative-held since it was drawn up in 1981 although Steve Ross came close to gaining it as an independent a couple of times.

This by-election will see party politics break out in Wiveliscombe, as there is no new independent candidate to replace Ross.  Possibly best placed to gain, judging by the county result, is Conservative candidate Phillip Thorne, a smallholder from Waterrow which is one of the West Deane villages in the ward.  The Liberal Democrats have selected Susan Levinge, a parish councillor in Chipstable - another of the West Deane villages - and qualified technical librarian.  Completing the ballot paper is Wiveliscombe resident Dave Mansell for the Green Party.

<h2>Heyhouses</h2>

Fylde council, Lancashire; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Barbara Nash at the age of 66, having suffered a heart attack while visiting family in Scotland over the Christmas period.  She had served since winning a by-election in July 2012.

Fancy a game of golf?  Well, you've come to the right place.  We are here in the town of St Annes on the Sea, a planned Victorian resort just to the south of Blackpool but <i>definitely not</i> part of it.  Among the sand dunes here before the town was developed was the hamlet of Heyhouses, which overlooked a low-lying and rich agricultural area called Lytham Moss.  Some of the sand dunes are still here in an area of open space: the southern end of the ward is taken up by the links course of the Royal Lythem and St Annes golf club, which is on the Open Championship rota and last hosted the tournament in 2012.  (I was there.)  Next to the Open course is the Blackpool South railway line, which is normally useless but is presently the only way into Blackpool by rail - that's thanks to overrunning electrification work which has closed the line to Blackpool North.  

In between the Moss and the golf course is Heyhouses' ward's population, formerly centred on a Government site off Heyhouses Road which was the original home of ERNIE, the random number generator which determined each month's Premium Bond winners.  ERNIE was transferred to Blackpool a few years ago and the government site is now being redeveloped for housing and a supermarket.  Lytham St Annes is a popular place for North West people to retire to and so the population skews older than average, while the nearby aerospace factory at Warton provides high-paying jobs all year round.

So, a ward in a coastal area with a large retired population and a closed government site, going to the polls following the death of a councillor who was first elected in a July 2012 by-election.  The parallels with Milford-on-Sea in Hampshire are uncanny.  Here's another one: this is a safe Conservative ward where the party was guaranteed a seat in 2015 due to insufficient opposition candidates.  That year the Tory slate won with 47% to 31% for Labour and 22% for the Liberal Democrats.  Barbara Nash's widower Edward holds the local county seat, St Annes South, and had a large majority last year.

Defending for the Conservatives is another Nash: Sally Nash, daughter of Barbara and Edward.  Lynn Goodwin returns for Labour after fighting the ward in 2015.  Liberal Democrat candidate Andrew Holland has more recent electoral experience after fighting the local county division in 2017.  Completing the ballot paper is Green Party candidate and anti-fracking campaigner Ian Roberts.

Previous Heyhouses poll 5 July 2012

HEYHOUSES, Fylde district council, Lancashire; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Peter Wood due to pressure of work.

We're in the coastal resort town of St Annes on the Sea here, a planned Victorian resort just south of Blackpool which has fused with the neighbouring older town of Lytham to form the larger town of Lytham St Annes.  The Heyhouses ward, named after one of the hamlets that was here among the sand dunes before the town of St Annes was developed, is on the landward side of town.  The northern half of the ward is Lytham Moss, a low-lying and rich agricultural area.  In the middle is the ward's population, centred around some large Government buildings off Heyhouses Lane which were once the home of ERNIE, the random number generator that determined each month's Premium Bond winners.  (The original ERNIE is now on display in the Science Museum, for which see the Brompton ward preview from last week.)  At the southern end of the ward, adjoining the useless railway line to Blackpool South, is more open space: the Royal Lytham and St Annes Golf Club, which will host the 2012 Open Championship in two weeks' time.

Lytham St Annes has a reputation as a retirement area and also as a wealthy area, with many people living here who work in the aerospace industry at Warton, on the road to Preston.  Stereotypically this results in a Tory ward with the Lib Dems running second; although the St Annes Tories performed rather poorly in 2009 and lost one of the town's two Lancashire county divisions to the Lib Dems (however, that was St Annes North which does not include this ward), they got a swing in their favour in 2011 compared to the previous district election.

Peter Wood's resignation cost the Tories their majority on Fylde district council, so they will be desperate to hold the seat.  They have selected Barbara Nash, a careers consultant who is married to a Fylde district and St Annes town councillor; she fought Ashton ward in last year's district election.  On paper her main opposition will come from the Lib Dems' Carol Gilligan, a businesswoman who came last in St John's ward last year.  Four other candidates have come out of the woodwork: Ian Roberts of the Green Party who is campaigning against the shale gas drilling/fracking in the Fylde and did pretty well here in the last St Annes town council election; Bill Dickson of UKIP; independent candidate Palmira Stafford, a local businesswoman who is involved with several local organisations; and Bill Whitehead, who was a UKIP candidate in the last Lancashire county council election, is standing under the banner of "Integrity UK".

<h2>Caol and Mallaig</h2>

Highland council, Scotland; caused by the death of Scottish National Party councillor Billy MacLachlan who had served since May 2017.

<blockquote>
"It's by Shiel water the track is to the west
By Ailort and by Morar to the sea.
- Traditional, <em>The Road to the Isles</em>
</blockquote>

Let's finish for the week with something completely different, for we are in the Highlands of Scotland.  The Caol and Mallaig ward is larger than several European countries, containing almost 800 square miles of mostly inhospital mountains.  The mountains are cut through by glens and lochs and run down to the Atlantic coast, along which most of the local population lives.

This column expressed some scepticism that Wiveliscombe could be described as a town given a population under 3,000, but that's a metropolis compared to some of the major population centres here.  Caol (this is not pronounced "kale" but something closer to "cool" or "curl") is essentially a Fort William suburb located at the head of Loch Linnhe and the bottom of Neptune's Staircase.  It and the nearby villages of Corpach and Banavie form the main population centre, accounting for just over half of the 7,071 electors.  To the east the ward covers the southern half of the Great Glen along with the side valleys of Glen Spean and Glen Garry.

But it's to the west of Caol that generations have journeyed along the Road to the Isles, through Glenfinnan to Arisaig, Morar and Mallaig, where the road and railway line terminate.  The only way from here to the rest of the ward is by sea, whether it's offshore to the Small Isles of Eigg, Muck, Rùm or Canna, or eastwards to Knoydart.  Knoydart's 98 electors may live on the Scottish mainland but they are cut off from the UK's road network by impassable mountains and deeply indented sealochs; unless you fancy a 16-mile hike over very rugged terrain, the only way in or out is by boat to Mallaig.

The poor quality of the Road to the Isles, which was still single-track in places until 2009, meant that the railway line to Mallaig survived the Beeching Report which had recommended it for closure.  The line may still be open, but it runs at an enormous loss; so back in 1984 British Rail decided to encourage tourists by reintroducing steam on the Fort William-Mallaig route in summer.  It was a success; no doubt helped by the train appearing in the Harry Potter films under the disguise of the Hogwarts Express, the "Jacobite" - as the service is now called - brings thousands of people to the area each summer.

An appropriate name, for this is the place where the 1745 Jacobite rebellion started.  The Young Pretender landed on the mainland at Loch nan Uamh, near Arisaig, and raised his standard at Glenfinnan.  The rising was of course eventually put down, but for many years afterwards the Highlands were essentially bandit country that tied the British Army down while it might have been doing something else.  One of the figures who benefited from this was James Wolfe, who learned how to command a regiment here before finding fame at Quebec in the hour of his death.  Rumours have persisted for centuries that the Jacobite treasure is buried somewhere near Loch Arkaig, an offshoot of the Great Glen.

Today the Highlands are politically the realm of the independent councillor.  When this ward was created in 2007 it elected three of them, Bill Clark, Allan Henderson and Eddie Hunter.  Those three councillors were all re-elected in 2012, an election where independent candidates had 82% of the first preferences.  Hunter resigned in 2014 as he was moving away from the area, and his seat was held by new independent candidate Ben Thompson.  Clark retired at the 2017 election, and his seat went to the SNP's Billy MacLachlan who became the ward's first party political councillor since proportional representation was introduced.  Henderson topped the poll with 28%, the SNP and Thompson had 24% each and runner-up was Lib Dem candidate Denis Rixson, some way behind on 9%.

The ward's geography creates unusual challenges for electoral administrators.  Rùm, Muck and Canna don't have polling stations and their inhabitants traditionally vote by post.  Knoydart and Eigg do have polling stations, but their ballot boxes will have to get on the boat to Mallaig for transport to the count in Caol.  Under those circumstances it's not surprising that the count for this by-election isn't starting until Friday morning.

Knoydart and Eigg have polling stations, but Rùm, Muck and Canna don't and 

With over half the vote in this ward normally going to independent candidates, and the Alternative Vote being in use for this by-election, the SNP have their work cut out to hold this one.  Their candidate selection doesn't inspre confidence: Alex MacInnes, a native Gaelic speaker who works in the seafood industry, gives an address in a hamlet in Wester Ross, over 90 miles by road from Caol and 130 miles from Mallaig.  In 2017 he fought his home ward of Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh.  There are three independent candidates: Ronald Campbell is from Glen Roy and stood for election to the Crofting Commission last year, coming in fifth and last in the South West Highlands constituency.  Third in that election was Catherine MacKinnon, also from Glen Roy, who according to a press report of a hustings has 26 years of experience of working with and for public agencies and assisting individuals, businesses and comunities throughout Lochaber.  Colin "Woody" Wood is a crofter who runs a caravan park in Corpach.  Returning from the 2017 election is Lib Dem candidate Denis Rixson, who has lived in Mallaig for more than 40 years; he is a former schoolteacher and bookshop owner.  Completing the ballot paper is Conservative candidate Ian Smith, who is as far away from the ward as MacInnes is; Smith gives an address in Alness, Easter Ross.

Previous Caol and Mallaig preview 1 May 2014

CAOL AND MALLAIG, Highland council; caused by the resignation of independent councillor Eddie Hunter, who is moving away from the area.

Welcome to the Highlands.  The Caol and Mallaig ward sprawls over almost 800 square miles, an area larger than several European countries, of mostly inhospitable mountains.  The ward's population is concentrated along the Atlantic seashore and in the glens along the lines of communication, notably the West Highland railway line.  

To describe the population centres (such as they are), Caol is essentially a suburb of Fort William (which forms the centre of a separate ward) at the northern end of the sea inlet of Loch Linnhe.  The eastern half of the ward consists of the southern half of the Great Glen together with Glen Spean; the two valleys meet at Spean Bridge, which is the biggest village in the area.  To the west of Fort William, the ward runs along the northern shore of Loch Eil, up to Glenfinnan (whose viaduct will be familiar to anyone who has seen the Harry Potter films) and then down to the Atlantic coast and the village of Arisaig, home to the UK's most westerly railway station.  The railway terminates at the fishing port of Mallaig, from which there are regular ferries to Armadale on the Isle of Skye (which is not part of this ward), to the Small Isles of Rhum, Eigg, Canna and Muck, and to Knoydart; the last wilderness on the British mainland, Knoydart is accesible only by boat or by a 16-mile hike through some of the most rugged country in Great Britain.  Skye is a ward of its own, but the Small Isles and Knoydart are both covered by Caol and Mallaig ward.  Also in this ward is reliable quiz-question fodder Loch Morar, the UK's deepest inland lake.

The notice of poll shows that over half the ward's 7,087 electors live in Caol and the neighbouring village of Corpach.  The only other settlements with more than 500 electors are Spean Bridge (696) and Mallaig (673).  The Small Isles have a single polling station on Eigg catering for 133 electors (although if I recall correctly the residents of Canna, Rhum and Muck traditionally vote by post), while the ward's smallest polling station is at Inverie, the largest hamlet on Knoydart, with 75 electors.

This was the place where the 1745 Jacobite rebellion started, the Young Pretender  landing on the mainland at Loch nan Uamh near Arisaig and raising his standard at Glenfinnan.  Even after the rising was put down the Highlands were essentially bandit country for many years (a young James Wolfe learned how to command a regiment here before finding lasting fame in the hour of his death at Quebec) and there are persistent rumours that the Jacobite treasure is buried somewhere in the vicinity of Loch Arkaig, an offshoot of the Great Glen.

In the modern day, the Highlands is the realm of the independent councillor.  When the modern ward was introduced (along with proportional representation) for the 2007 election 74% of its votes went to independent councillors Bill Clark, Allan Henderson and Eddie Hunter, all of whom were easily re-elected in 2012.  Ballot box counts are available for the 2012 election; they reveal that Hunter narrowly led in Caol (where he lived), Clark in the Corpach polling district (where he lives) and Henderson everywhere else, including the postal votes; Henderson polled 82% of the first preferences in the Mallaig, Small Isles and Knoydart boxes.  The 2012 results showed the strongest challenge to the independents coming from the SNP, who polled 15% (the five independent candidates polled 81% between them, with the remaining 4% shared between the Tories and the Christian Party).

Two independent candidates have come forward to succeed Hunter: they are Ben Thompson and Sandy Watson, both of whom are from the Caol area: Thompson owns a bicycle shop, while Watson is a former local business owner with a background in computing.  The SNP candidate is William Macdonald, who fought his home ward of Fort William and Ardnamurchan in 2012.  The Tories have given up on the ward, but a score of 1.6% last time out hasn't put off the Christian Party's Susan Wallace, who tries again.  Completing the ballot paper is the ward's first UKIP candidate, Liam Simmonds.
