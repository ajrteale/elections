Previous New Forest poll 19 July 2012

MILFORD, New Forest district council, Hampshire; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Michael Pemberton.

Milford ward includes Hampshire's southernmost point at Hurst Castle, on a spit of land marking the western end of the Solent.  For those who don't fancy the walk along the spit a ferry service to the castle is available in season from the touristy fishing hamlet of Keyhaven.  Keyhaven and Hurst Castle are within the New Forest National Park, but the village of Milford on Sea, a seaside retirement village which is the largest settlement within Milford ward, is not.  The ward includes the whole of Milford-on-Sea parish together with a small part of the neighbouring village of Everton, including the former Efford Horticultural Research Station, now a nursery.

This ward is even safer for the Conservatives than Queen's ward above, the most recent result being a 79-21 win in a straight fight with a single Labour candidate in 2011.  The Tories defeated a single Liberal Democrat candidate by the same score in 2007.

The Conservatives have selected Milton-on-Sea parish councillor Sophie Beeton as their candidate in the by-election; she is opposed by Labour candidate Caroline Hexter, a nursery school teacher from New Milton.

Previous Heyhouses poll 5 July 2012

HEYHOUSES, Fylde district council, Lancashire; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Peter Wood due to pressure of work.

We're in the coastal resort town of St Annes on the Sea here, a planned Victorian resort just south of Blackpool which has fused with the neighbouring older town of Lytham to form the larger town of Lytham St Annes.  The Heyhouses ward, named after one of the hamlets that was here among the sand dunes before the town of St Annes was developed, is on the landward side of town.  The northern half of the ward is Lytham Moss, a low-lying and rich agricultural area.  In the middle is the ward's population, centred around some large Government buildings off Heyhouses Lane which were once the home of ERNIE, the random number generator that determined each month's Premium Bond winners.  (The original ERNIE is now on display in the Science Museum, for which see the Brompton ward preview from last week.)  At the southern end of the ward, adjoining the useless railway line to Blackpool South, is more open space: the Royal Lytham and St Annes Golf Club, which will host the 2012 Open Championship in two weeks' time.

Lytham St Annes has a reputation as a retirement area and also as a wealthy area, with many people living here who work in the aerospace industry at Warton, on the road to Preston.  Stereotypically this results in a Tory ward with the Lib Dems running second; although the St Annes Tories performed rather poorly in 2009 and lost one of the town's two Lancashire county divisions to the Lib Dems (however, that was St Annes North which does not include this ward), they got a swing in their favour in 2011 compared to the previous district election.

Peter Wood's resignation cost the Tories their majority on Fylde district council, so they will be desperate to hold the seat.  They have selected Barbara Nash, a careers consultant who is married to a Fylde district and St Annes town councillor; she fought Ashton ward in last year's district election.  On paper her main opposition will come from the Lib Dems' Carol Gilligan, a businesswoman who came last in St John's ward last year.  Four other candidates have come out of the woodwork: Ian Roberts of the Green Party who is campaigning against the shale gas drilling/fracking in the Fylde and did pretty well here in the last St Annes town council election; Bill Dickson of UKIP; independent candidate Palmira Stafford, a local businesswoman who is involved with several local organisations; and Bill Whitehead, who was a UKIP candidate in the last Lancashire county council election, is standing under the banner of "Integrity UK".

Previous Caol and Mallaig preview 1 May 2014

CAOL AND MALLAIG, Highland council; caused by the resignation of independent councillor Eddie Hunter, who is moving away from the area.

Welcome to the Highlands.  The Caol and Mallaig ward sprawls over almost 800 square miles, an area larger than several European countries, of mostly inhospitable mountains.  The ward's population is concentrated along the Atlantic seashore and in the glens along the lines of communication, notably the West Highland railway line.  

To describe the population centres (such as they are), Caol is essentially a suburb of Fort William (which forms the centre of a separate ward) at the northern end of the sea inlet of Loch Linnhe.  The eastern half of the ward consists of the southern half of the Great Glen together with Glen Spean; the two valleys meet at Spean Bridge, which is the biggest village in the area.  To the west of Fort William, the ward runs along the northern shore of Loch Eil, up to Glenfinnan (whose viaduct will be familiar to anyone who has seen the Harry Potter films) and then down to the Atlantic coast and the village of Arisaig, home to the UK's most westerly railway station.  The railway terminates at the fishing port of Mallaig, from which there are regular ferries to Armadale on the Isle of Skye (which is not part of this ward), to the Small Isles of Rhum, Eigg, Canna and Muck, and to Knoydart; the last wilderness on the British mainland, Knoydart is accesible only by boat or by a 16-mile hike through some of the most rugged country in Great Britain.  Skye is a ward of its own, but the Small Isles and Knoydart are both covered by Caol and Mallaig ward.  Also in this ward is reliable quiz-question fodder Loch Morar, the UK's deepest inland lake.

The notice of poll shows that over half the ward's 7,087 electors live in Caol and the neighbouring village of Corpach.  The only other settlements with more than 500 electors are Spean Bridge (696) and Mallaig (673).  The Small Isles have a single polling station on Eigg catering for 133 electors (although if I recall correctly the residents of Canna, Rhum and Muck traditionally vote by post), while the ward's smallest polling station is at Inverie, the largest hamlet on Knoydart, with 75 electors.

This was the place where the 1745 Jacobite rebellion started, the Young Pretender  landing on the mainland at Loch nan Uamh near Arisaig and raising his standard at Glenfinnan.  Even after the rising was put down the Highlands were essentially bandit country for many years (a young James Wolfe learned how to command a regiment here before finding lasting fame in the hour of his death at Quebec) and there are persistent rumours that the Jacobite treasure is buried somewhere in the vicinity of Loch Arkaig, an offshoot of the Great Glen.

In the modern day, the Highlands is the realm of the independent councillor.  When the modern ward was introduced (along with proportional representation) for the 2007 election 74% of its votes went to independent councillors Bill Clark, Allan Henderson and Eddie Hunter, all of whom were easily re-elected in 2012.  Ballot box counts are available for the 2012 election; they reveal that Hunter narrowly led in Caol (where he lived), Clark in the Corpach polling district (where he lives) and Henderson everywhere else, including the postal votes; Henderson polled 82% of the first preferences in the Mallaig, Small Isles and Knoydart boxes.  The 2012 results showed the strongest challenge to the independents coming from the SNP, who polled 15% (the five independent candidates polled 81% between them, with the remaining 4% shared between the Tories and the Christian Party).

Two independent candidates have come forward to succeed Hunter: they are Ben Thompson and Sandy Watson, both of whom are from the Caol area: Thompson owns a bicycle shop, while Watson is a former local business owner with a background in computing.  The SNP candidate is William Macdonald, who fought his home ward of Fort William and Ardnamurchan in 2012.  The Tories have given up on the ward, but a score of 1.6% last time out hasn't put off the Christian Party's Susan Wallace, who tries again.  Completing the ballot paper is the ward's first UKIP candidate, Liam Simmonds.
