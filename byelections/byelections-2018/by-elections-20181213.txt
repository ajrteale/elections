"All the right votes, but not necessarily in the right order"

This column does indeed cover all the important votes, and away from the drama of Westminster the local by-election cycle is still just about turning.  We already know the winner of one of this week's polls, the election for Alderman of Broad Street ward in the City of London: nobody challenged the incumbent Alderman Michael Mainelli, and he will be formally declared re-elected at the Wardmote tonight.  This column sends its congratulations.  That's not the only piece of electoral news taking place today, as we go to Nottinghamshire for an unusual Wednesday by-election...

<h2>Sutton Junction and Harlow Wood</h2>

Ashfield council, Nottinghamshire; caused by the resignation of Steven Carroll, who had been elected for Labour but had defected to the Ashfield Independents group.  He was first elected in 2011, sitting for the predecessor ward of Sutton in Ashfield East until 2015; and had also been a long-serving Nottinghamshire county councillor until losing his seat in 2017.

We have come to Sutton-in-Ashfield, a town of around 45,000 souls some miles to the north of Nottingham.  Although there is (or was) coal down below, Sutton-in-Ashfield was traditionally more of a textile town specialising in hosiery.  The town's main park, Sutton Lawns, was once the grounds of a stately home built by a hosiery merchant, whose mill still stands on the edge of the park; and the tights and stockings brand Pretty Polly started life in Sutton-in-Ashfield in 1919.  (In case you're wondering, the name comes from the racehorse of that name which won the Fillies' Triple Crown in 1904; a local bookmaker made a lot of money from that, and his daughter lifted the name for the company.)  Pretty Polly was still manufacturing here until 2005, but then crossed the border into Derbyshire where its products are now made in Belper.

Further to the east is the village of Harlow Wood, set in one of the few remaining parts of Sherwood Forest.  Harlow Wood specialises in help for the infirm and disabled: there was once an orthopaedic hospital here, while still going is Portland College which provides vocational training for the disabled.  Its original intake in 1949 was made up of Second World War veterans and former miners.

Sherwood Forest was of course the home of that noted criminal Robin Hood, whose speciality was in stealing from the rich and giving to the poor.  This is similar to the sort of thing the Labour Party would like to get the chance to do, but it's not always plain sailing for the party in Ashfield.  The district's politics has never been quite the same since the political rise of Jason Zadrozny, who became leader of the council in 2007 at the age of just 27 as leader of the Liberal Democrat group: four years later he was less than 200 votes away from becoming the first Lib Dem MP for Ashfield.  Despite Labour regaining an overall majority on the council in 2011, the Ashfield Lib Dems didn't give up and were very confident of getting Zadrozy over the line and into Parliament in the 2015 general election - until just before the close of nominations when he was arrested on child sax allegations.

The case didn't come to trial until the November 2017, at which point the prosecution offered no evidence and Zadrozny was acquitted of all charges.  In the meantime he had been re-elected to Ashfield council and Nottinghamshire county council as an independent, having been dropped by the Lib Dems, as well as contesting the 2016 election for Nottinghamshire Police and Crime Commissioner.

With his political career free to resume, Zadrozny has wasted no time in getting back to the levers of power, helped by an almighty split in the Ashfield Labour party which in the 2015 election had won 22 out of 35 seats, with 5 Lib Dems, 4 Conservatives and 4 Independents forming the opposition.  There was a sign of things to come in the last Ashfield by-election, held in Hucknall in October 2017 to replace Tory councillor Ben Bradley who had been elected as Tory MP for Mansfield.  Let that sink in for the moment: a Tory MP for Mansfield.  The Conservatives resoundingly lost that council by-election to the Zadroznyite independents.  Six months later, Jason Zadrozny was back as council leader after several Labour councillors defected: his Ashfield Independents group runs a minority administration with 10 councillors, against 14 Labour, 5 Conservatives, 5 other independents, zero Liberal Democrats and this vacancy.

Which is suitably complicated, for Steven Carroll was one of the Labour councillors who had defected to the Zadrozynite banner.  This ward was created only in 2015 when the Boundary Commission split up the former Sutton in Ashfield East ward into several smaller areas: and Carooll was elected very narrowly in that election.  His winning score was 661 votes with the Liberal Democrats just six votes behind on 655; both parties had 38% of the vote, with the Conservatives taking the remaining 25%.  With the turnaround in the district's political scene since then, a better guide may be the Nottinghamshire county council elections in May last year: all three Sutton-in-Ashfield divisions returned Zadroznyite candidates with over 60% of the vote, Labour's Steve Carroll losing his seat in Sutton Central and East (which includes this ward) by the score of 60-32.  And no doubt watching closely will be the shadow justice secretary and Labour MP for Ashfield Gloria de Piero, who was re-elected in June last year with a 9% swing against her and a majority of just 441 votes over the Conservatives.

So this by-election looks more consequential than most, as it will give an important indication of where the electoral momentum (as opposed the political momentum, or even the political Momentum) is in this corner of Nottinghamshire.  The Ashfield Independents will be hoping to defend their defection gain, and have selected Matthew Relf who works in IT.  Labour will want their seat back, and their candidate is Kevin Hall.  The Lib Dems will be hoping to win here with Martin Howes, a business analyst.  You can't really blame the Conservatives for running a Self-centred campaign, because Christine Self is their candidate.  Also standing are two candidates who in this time of Brexit will be hoping to appeal to the town's Leave majority: Stephen Crosby for the Democrats and Veterans Party and Moira Sansom for UKIP.

<h2>West Green</h2>

Haringey council, North London; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Ishmael Osamor.  

As anybody who performs on a stage will know, timing is everything.  We're in a fast-changing political landscape here, and that's creating all sorts of problems for Andrew's Previews.  I wrote this piece last weekend, and delivered it to Britain Elects on Tuesday morning, so I have no idea in what political context the results of these by-elections are going to be seen through.  By the time you read this we might have an agreement on how to withdraw from the EU (and not before time); we might have had a government no-confidenced for the first time since 1979; we might have a new Prime Minister; we might be in all sorts of political, constitutional and economic chaos with nobody knowing what the heck is going on.  Or we might be carrying on pretty much as before with desperately trying to finish the Christmas shopping being the number one priority.  What transpires between the time of writing and the time you read this is going to depend on a large number of political actors looking plausible, staying sober and saying the lines they are given in the right order; who goes off-script or fluffs their entries could end up having unexpected consequences.

Your columnist tried to study mathemmatics, and from a mathematical point of view there are two things which stand out in the current political atmosphere.  There's a whole field of mathematics called chaos theory, which takes some equations which may look very simple and deterministic but whose outcomes depend so finely on the initial conditions that it's impossible to predict how they are going to behave in practice.  The butterfly effect, you might call it.  You don't have to go far in real life to find chaotic systems: look at the weather, the stock market, the UK Independence Party.  Any budding mathematician will also be familiar with the concept of <em>reductio ad absurdum</em> or, to give it its modern name, proof by contradiction, which lies at the heart of many mathematical proofs: the existence of an infinity of prime numbers, the irrationality of the square root of 2 and the impossibility of Fermat's Last THeorem all depend on this technique.  The idea is to assume a position (say, that it's possible to have one's cake and eat it) and keep arguing until you end up with something which is either manifestly not true or is exactly opposite to something you've already established or assumed earlier in the argument (this would require the same cake to be in two places simultaneously), at which point your position collapses into a contradiction and disappears in a puff of logic.  Politics, unfortunately, has sidestepped this mathematical technique by developing the concept of "cakeism"; that successor to doublethink has only served to kick further down the road the point at which the contradictions are revealed, the red lines disappear in a puff of logic and it transpires that someone left the cake out in the rain.

Cakeism really should have been the Word of 2018, but the Oxford Dictionaries' lexicographers disagreed.  Instead they voted for another politically-inspired word to describe our times: "toxic".  Which brings us neatly to this week's first by-election.  There are all sorts of toxic things out there, not all of which are political.  Indeed some toxic things are quite enjoyable: it's not for nothing that the dictionary lists "intoxicating" as a synomym of "exhilirating" or "exciting".  Some toxic things are quite illegal.  Some are both enjoyable and illegal.

A lesson learned the hard way this year by a man in his twenties called Ishmael Osamor.  In 2017 Mr Osamor had travelled to the Lulworth Estate in Dorset to attend the music festival Bestival.  On the second day of Bestival he was caught by police in possession of £2,500 worth of cannabis, cocaine, esctasy and ketamine, which led to charges being brought by police.  At Bournemouth crown court in October Osamor pleaded guilty to four drugs offences - three counts of possession with intent to supply and one of possession - and was sentenced to a two-year community order.  His mum stood by him, which is fair enough: that's what mums do.



sn't that quick, and following the Brexit shambles over the last few years gives the strong impression of working through such a proof without yet having got to the point where the contradictions are revealed and the cake proves to have been left out in the rain.

The som of the Edmonton MP Kate Osamor, Ishmael resigned after pleading guilty to possession of Class A drugs with intent to supply.



 the last few years we have successfully piled all sorts of logic and red lines on top of a heap of contradictions without yet reaching the <em>dénoument</em> at which the contradictions are revealed.  On the other hand, that
