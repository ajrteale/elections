"All the right votes, but not necessarily in the right order"

This column does indeed cover all the important votes, and away from the drama of Westminster the local by-election cycle is still just about turning.  We already know the winner of one of this week's polls, the election for Alderman of Broad Street ward in the City of London: nobody challenged the incumbent Alderman Michael Mainelli, and he will be formally declared re-elected at the Wardmote tonight.  That's not the only piece of electoral news taking place today, as we go to Nottinghamshire for an unusual Wednesday by-election...

<h2>Sutton Junction and Harlow Wood</h2>

Ashfield council, Nottinghamshire; caused by the resignation of Steven Carroll, who had been elected for Labour but had defected to the Ashfield Independents group.  He was first elected in 2011, sitting for the predecessor ward of Sutton in Ashfield East until 2015.

We have come to Sutton-in-Ashfield, a town of around 45,000 souls some miles to the north of Nottingham.  We're on the county's coalfield here, but Sutton-in-Ashfield was traditionally more of a textile town specialising in hosiery.  The town's main park, Sutton Lawns, was once the grounds of a stately home built by a hosiery merchant, whose mill still stands on the edge of the park; and the tights and stockings brand Pretty Polly started life in Sutton-in-Ashfield in 1919.  (In case you're wondering, the name comes from the racehorse of that name which won the Fillies' Triple Crown in 1904; a local bookmaker made a lot of money from that, and his daughter lifted the name for the company.)  Pretty Polly was still manufacturing here until 2005, but then crossed the border into Derbyshire where its products are now made in Belper.

Further to the east is the village of Harlow Wood, set in one of the few remaining parts of Sherwood Forest.  Harlow Wood specialises in help for the infirm and disabled: there was once an orthopaedic hospital here, while still going is Portland College which provides vocational training for the disabled.  Its original intake in 1949 was made up of Second World War veterans and former miners.

Sherwood Forest was of course the home of that noted criminal Robin Hood, whose speciality was in stealing from the rich and giving to the poor.  This is similar to the sort of thing the Labour Party would like to get the chance to do, but it's not always plain sailing for the party in Ashfield.  The district's politics has never been quite the same since the political rise of Jason Zadrozny, who became leader of the council in 2007 at the age of just 27 as leader of the Liberal Democrat group.  Despite Labour regaining an overall majority on the council in 2011, the Ashfield Lib Dems didn't give up and were very confident of electing Zadrozy to Parliament in the 2015 general election - until just before the close of nominations when he was arrested on child sax allegations.

The case didn't come to trial until the end of 2017, at which point the prosecution offered no evidence and Zadrozny was acquitted of all charges.  In the meantime he had been re-elected to Ashfield council and Nottinghamshire county council as an independent, having been dropped by the Lib Dems, as well as contesting the 2016 election for Nottinghamshire Police and Crime Commissioner.

With his political career free to resume, Zadrozny has wasted no time in getting back to the levers of power, helped by an almighty split in the Ashfield Labour party which in the 2015 election had won 22 out of 35 seats, with 5 Lib Dems, 4 Conservatives and 4 Independents forming the opposition.  There was a sign of things to come in the last Ashfield by-election, held in Hucknall in October 2017 to replace Tory councillor Ben Bradley who had been elected as Tory MP for Mansfield.  Let that sink in for the moment: a Tory MP for Mansfield.  The Conservatives resoundingly lost that by-election to the Zadroznyite independents.  Six months later, Jason Zadrozny was back as council leader after several Labour councillors defected: his Ashfield Independents group runs a minority administration with 10 councillors, against 14 Labour, 5 Conservatives and this vacancy.

Which is suitably complicated, for Steven Carroll was one of the Labour councillors who had defected to the Zadrozynite banner.  His ward was created only in 2015 when the Boundary Commission split up the former Sutton in Ashfield East ward into several smaller areas
