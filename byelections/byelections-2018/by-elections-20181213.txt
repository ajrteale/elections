This column does indeed cover all the important votes, and away from the drama of Westminster the local by-election cycle is still just about turning.  We already know the winner of one of this week's polls, the election for Alderman of Broad Street ward in the City of London: nobody challenged the incumbent Alderman Michael Mainelli, and he will be formally declared re-elected at the Wardmote tonight.  This column sends its congratulations to Alderman Mainelli.  That's not the only piece of electoral news taking place today, as we go to Nottinghamshire for an unusual Wednesday by-election...

<h2>Sutton Junction and Harlow Wood</h2>

Ashfield council, Nottinghamshire; caused by the resignation of Steven Carroll, who had been elected for Labour but had defected to the Ashfield Independents group.  He was first elected in 2011, sitting for the predecessor ward of Sutton in Ashfield East until 2015; and had also been a long-serving Nottinghamshire county councillor until losing his seat in 2017.

We have come to Sutton-in-Ashfield, a town of around 45,000 souls some miles to the north of Nottingham.  Although there is (or was) coal down below, Sutton-in-Ashfield was traditionally more of a textile town specialising in hosiery.  The town's main park, Sutton Lawns, was once the grounds of a stately home built by a hosiery merchant, whose mill still stands on the edge of the park; and the tights and stockings brand Pretty Polly started life in Sutton-in-Ashfield in 1919.  (In case you're wondering, the name comes from a racehorse which won the Fillies' Triple Crown in 1904; a local bookmaker made a lot of money from that, and his daughter lifted the name for the company.)  Pretty Polly was still manufacturing here until 2005, but then crossed the border into Derbyshire where its products are now made in Belper.

Further to the east is the village of Harlow Wood, set in one of the few remaining parts of Sherwood Forest.  Harlow Wood specialises in help for the infirm and disabled: there was once an orthopaedic hospital here, while still going is Portland College which provides vocational training for the disabled.  Its original intake in 1949 was made up of Second World War veterans and former miners.

Sherwood Forest was of course the home of that noted criminal Robin Hood, whose speciality was in income redistribution in favour of the poor.  This is similar to the sort of thing the Labour Party might like to get the chance to do, but it's not always plain sailing for the party in Ashfield.  The district's politics has never been quite the same since the political rise of Jason Zadrozny, who became leader of the council in 2007 at the age of just 27 as leader of the Liberal Democrat group: three years later he was less than 200 votes away from becoming the first Lib Dem MP for Ashfield.  Despite Labour regaining an overall majority on the council in 2011, the Ashfield Lib Dems didn't give up and were very confident of getting Zadrozy over the line and into Parliament in the 2015 general election - until just before the close of nominations when he was arrested on child sax allegations.

The case didn't come to trial until November 2017, at which point the prosecution offered no evidence and Zadrozny was acquitted of all charges.  In the meantime he had been re-elected to Ashfield council and Nottinghamshire county council as an independent, having been dropped by the Lib Dems, as well as contesting the 2016 election for Nottinghamshire Police and Crime Commissioner.

With his political career free to resume, Zadrozny has wasted no time in getting back to the levers of power, helped by an almighty split in the Ashfield Labour party which in the 2015 election had won 22 out of 35 seats, with 5 Lib Dems, 4 Conservatives and 4 Independents forming the opposition.  There was a sign of things to come in the last Ashfield by-election, held in Hucknall in October 2017 to replace Tory councillor Ben Bradley who had been elected as Tory MP for Mansfield.  Let that sink in for the moment: a Tory MP for Mansfield.  The Conservatives resoundingly lost that council by-election to the Zadroznyite independents.  Six months later, Jason Zadrozny was back as council leader after several Labour councillors defected: his Ashfield Independents group runs a minority administration with 10 councillors, against 14 Labour, 5 Conservatives, 5 other independents, zero Liberal Democrats and this vacancy.

Which is suitably complicated, for Steven Carroll was one of the Labour councillors who had defected to the Zadrozynite banner.  This ward was created only in 2015 when the Boundary Commission split up the former Sutton in Ashfield East ward into several smaller areas: and Carroll was elected very narrowly in that year.  His winning score was 661 votes with the Liberal Democrats just six votes behind on 655; both parties had 38% of the vote, with the Conservatives taking the remaining 25%.  With the turnaround in the district's political scene since then, a better guide may be the Nottinghamshire county council elections in May last year: all three Sutton-in-Ashfield divisions returned Zadroznyite candidates with over 60% of the vote, Labour's Steve Carroll losing his seat in Sutton Central and East (which includes this ward) by the score of 60-32.  And no doubt watching closely will be the shadow justice secretary and Labour MP for Ashfield Gloria de Piero, who was re-elected in June last year with a 9% swing against her and a majority of just 441 votes over the Conservatives.

So this by-election looks more consequential than most, as it will give an important indication of where the electoral momentum (as opposed the political momentum, or even the political Momentum) is in this corner of Nottinghamshire.  The Ashfield Independents will be hoping to defend their defection gain, and have selected Matthew Relf who works in IT.  Labour will want their seat back, and their candidate is Kevin Hall.  The Lib Dems will be hoping to prove that there is life after Zadrozny with Martin Howes, a business analyst.  You can't really blame the Conservatives for running a Self-centred campaign, because Christine Self is their candidate.  Also standing are two candidates who in this time of Brexit will be hoping to appeal to the town's Leave majority: Stephen Crosby for the Democrats and Veterans Party and Moira Sansom for UKIP.

<h2>West Green</h2>

Haringey council, North London; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Ishmael Osamor.  

As anybody who performs on a stage will know, timing is everything.  We're in a fast-changing political landscape here, and that's creating all sorts of problems for Andrew's Previews.  Being a busy man, I drafted this piece last weekend and delivered it to Britain Elects on Tuesday morning, so I have no idea in what political context the results of these by-elections are going to be seen.  By the time you read this we might have an agreement on how to withdraw from the EU (and not before time); we might have had a government no-confidenced for the first time since 1979; we might have a new Prime Minister; we might be in all sorts of political, constitutional and economic chaos with nobody knowing what the heck is going on.  Or we might be carrying on pretty much as before with desperately trying to finish the Christmas shopping being the number one priority.  What transpires between the time of writing and the time you read this is going to depend on a large number of political actors looking plausible, staying sober and saying the lines they are given in the right order; any ad-libs or fluffed entries could end up having unexpected consequences.

In the event that Things Have Happened since I wrote this, it is probably worth pointing out that the electoral cycle turns more slowly than the 24-hour news cycle.  These are local by-elections with local issues, turnout will probably be low, we're in the middle of December when people have lots of other priorities, and a fair chunk of the votes which will be counted tonight will be postal votes which may have been returned a week ago or more.  As a wise man once said, that's a long time in politics.  Feel free to draw whatever Hot Takes you like from tonight's by-election results, but do bear those points in mind before starting to form conclusions.  Also bear in mind that you won't get any Hot Takes from the Tory Shires tonight: this week is very much a Dodgy Council Estate Special, and the one Tory defence of the week is in rural Scotland where the electoral context is different to the rest of the UK.

This being the middle of December, we're also at the point of the year where awards start to be given out and reviews of the year are drafted.  One of the more pointless awards is that for the Word of the Year, adjudicated by the Oxford Dictionaries.  In your columnist's opinion this really should have gone to "cakeism", that dubious successor to doublethink which has been a running theme of the Brexit debates; but the lexicographers disagreed.  Instead they voted for another politically-inspired word to describe the year of our Lord, 2018: "toxic".  Which brings us neatly to this week's first by-election.  There are all sorts of toxic things out there, not all of which are political.  Indeed some toxic things are quite enjoyable: it's not for nothing that the dictionary lists "intoxicating" as a synonym of "exhilarating" or "exciting".  Some toxic things are, however, quite illegal.  Some are both enjoyable <em>and</em> illegal.

A lesson learned the hard way this year by a man in his twenties called Ishmael Osamor.  In 2017 Mr Osamor had travelled to the Lulworth Estate in Dorset to attend the music festival Bestival.  On the second day of Bestival 2017 he was caught by police in possession of £2,500 worth of cannabis, cocaine, ecstasy and ketamine, which led to charges being brought.  At Bournemouth crown court in October 2018 Osamor pleaded guilty to four drugs offences - three counts of possession with intent to supply and one of possession - and was sentenced to a two-year community order.  His mum stood by him, which is fair enough: that's what mums do.  And in the normal course of events that would probably have been that.

This, of course, is not the normal course of events.  (Why do you think I'm writing this?)  Ishmael Osamor's mum is also his employer: she is Kate Osamor, Member of Parliament for Edmonton and (until she resigned the week before last following some ill-advised words to a journalist looking into the whole affair) shadow international development secretary, and she employs Ishmael in her parliamentary office.  And between charges being brought and the trial taking place, Osamor junior had entered the weird and wacky world of Haringey Labour politics by being elected to Haringey council in May this year.  He had already made his mark by joining the council's cabinet.  A two-year community order is nowhere near the sentence level which would have disqualified him from the council; but when the conviction became public knowledge questions were inevitably raised over how this person was selected as a candidate given that there were criminal charges hanging over him.  Knowing that timing is everything, Ishmael Osamor chose to exit the political stage before he was pushed, and immediately resigned from Haringey council after less than six months in office.

It's rather a long way from the Lulworth Estate to the Broadwater Farm Estate, both geographically and socially.  The Farm is the major part of Haringey's West Green ward: in a borough starkly divided between rich and poor, this is in the poor half.  Although most of the area was built-up by 1920 as the railways connected Tottenham to central London, Broadwater Farm remained rural thanks to its low-lying ground which was prone to flooding from the River Moselle; when Tottenham urban district council bought the farm in 1932 it initially turned half of it into a park (the Lordship Recreation Ground) and the other half into allotments.

Development came to the Moselle valley (that reminds me, I must get some wine in for Christmas) in 1967 with Haringey council commencing construction of the Broadwater Farm Estate, a series of concrete carbuncles in the style of Charles-Édouard Jeanneret.  Le Corbusier may have seen the house as a machine for living in, but the Broadwater Farm housing didn't prove a very effective machine in its initial form: within a decade of opening the Department of the Environment had called for demolition as the only way of improving it.  The Farm became a byword for unsuccessful social housing, and its problems came to a head in 1985 with race riots and the still-unsolved murder of PC Keith Blakelock.  Things have turned around dramatically since, and in 2005 the Metropolitan Police disbanded its Broadwater Farm unit because there was such a low crime rate on the estate.  Despite some redevelopment, the problems with substandard housing haven't gone away, and the Grenfell Tower fire brought things to a head: two of the Farm's tower blocks were condemned and evacuated earlier this year pending demolition, with nine others found to be structurally unsafe.

This ward isn't all Broadwater Farm, of course; to the west of the Lordship Recreation Ground are a series of Victorian terraces along Downhills Way and Westbury Avenue, while the West Green area itself is at the ward's southern end.  Connections to Central London are provided by the Underground station at Turnpike Lane, which is at the western corner of the ward.

The census makes the point that this is one of the most ethnically diverse areas of London.  In 2011 West Green was in the top 25 wards in England and Wales for the "White Other" ethnic group at 31% of the population; that compared to 24% black (just outside the top 100), 22% White British and 5.6% "other" ethnic groups.  It was in the top 50 wards for those new born in the new EU states, with Poles and Bulgarians particularly strongly represented; the census also picked up large proportions born in Turkey and Ghana.

There has been a West Green ward since Haringey borough was formed in 1965, and for some time afterwards this was a close-fought marginal ward with a strong Conservative vote.  The Tories carried West Green in 1968 and 1982, and won two out of three seats here in 1986.  Things changed in the early 1990s with a change in Haringey's housing policy so that people on the housing waiting list couldn't refuse an offer without a good reason.  This allowed Broadwater Farm to fill up (large parts of it had previously been unoccupied) at the same time as the Conservative vote was melting away in the aftermath of Black Wednesday.  The 1994 council elections marked a decisive shift with the Conservative vote halving, and Labour haven't been seriously challenged here since.  One other footnote from 1994 is that the ward was contested that year by George Silcott, brother of Winston Silcott who had been wrongly convicted of PC Blakelock's murder; George stood as an independent and finished last out of 11 candidates.

Haringey Labour has had its problems over the years, most recently with a well-publicised takeover by the party's left wing in advance of the 2018 elections - rather appropriate really in a borough where Jeremy Corbyn used to be a councillor.  The left-wing takeover clearly went down badly in the muesli belt of Hornsey and Wood Green (the Liberal Democrats gained six council seats there in May) but probably didn't have as much of an adverse effect in West Green ward.  In May Labour won here with 64% of the vote, with the Greens best of the rest on 13%; the Lib Dems, Conservatives and George Galloway's Respect party have all filled the runner-up spot here at some point this century.  In the 2016 London Mayoral election Sadiq Khan beat Zac Goldsmith here 69-13, while the Labour slate led the Greens 63-12 in the London Members ballot.

Defending for Labour is Seema Chandwani, a Unite figure and chairwoman of the Haringey branch of the TUC.  The Green Party candidate is Cecily Spelling who works for an environmental charity.  Also standing are Mirza Baig for the Conservatives and Elizabeth Payne for the Lib Dems.

<h2>Toddbrook</h2>

Harlow council, Essex; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Karen Clempner who had served since 2015.

We move further up the Lea Valley to the centre of the New Town of Harlow.  Here can be found the main central shopping area, the Harvey Shopping Centre, the Playhouse and the Water Gardens; south of those is the Todd Brook, a stream after which the ward is named; and south of that is the ward's main housing area along Partridge Road and Tendring Road.  Continuing our Council Estate theme, this is New Town development mostly from the 1950s and 1960s, with high levels of social housing and a working-class demographic.

Toddbrook ward normally votes Labour, although the Conservatives won it at a by-election in October 2007 and in the 2008 election, and UKIP were only 28 votes behind Labour in 2014.  Since then Labour have made this ward safe again: in May this year their outgoing councillor Tony Edwards was re-elected by a margin of 52-33 over the Conservatives, which was a slight swing in his favour from the September 2017 by-election at which Edwards was first elected.  The Andrew's Previews entry for that by-election is republished in the book <em>Andrew's Previews 2017</em>, a delightful Christmas gift for the discerning follower of politics.  However, the Conservatives represent this area both at Parliamentary level and on Essex county council, where they gained the Harlow West division from Labour last year.

And, like Haringey earlier, this is a council where the ruling Labour group has been the subject of a left-wing takeover in recent months.  Clempner cited an uncomfortable atmosphere within Harlow Labour in her resignation statement; and she's clearly not alone in that because she's the fourth Harlow Labour councillor to resign this year, at last three of three resignations coming after run-ins with the left of the party.  That list includes Karen Clempner's husband John, who was leader of the council until he was deposed in January.

Defending for Labour this time is Frances Mason.  The Conservative candidate is Tom Reynolds.  Also standing are former Harlow councillor Dan Long for UKIP and Christopher Millington for the Green Party.  Whoever wins is likely to be back on the campaign trail in short order to seek re-election in May 2019.

<h2>Brambles and Thorntree</h2>

Middlesbrough council, North Yorkshire; caused by the death of Labour councillor Peter Purvis.  He had served since 2007, originally being elected for Thorntree ward before transferring here in 2015.

For our final Labour defence of the week we are in sunny Middlesbrough.  The Boro is not a rich town: with the death of the local iron and steel industry in many ways it's a place seeking for a new future for itself.  The demise of the traditional industries has led to huge unemployment in Teesside, and few places have been worse hit than Brambles and Thorntree.

The Thorntree estate in particular gets a bad press.  It dates from the late 1940s, and is a bastion of the unskilled working class, which is a bit of a problem when there are very few jobs of that nature on Teesside.  The estate was a ward of its own until 2015; the old Thorntree ward was no 3 in the 2000 English indices of multiple deprivation, and in the 2011 census ranked 6th in England and Wales for unemployment (13%) and 6th again for adults with no qualifications (49%).  It also made the top 100 wards in England and Wales in the "semi-routine" and "routine" occupational groups, those who have never worked or are long-term unemployed, those looking after home or family, those with long-term sickness or disability, social renting and under-16s.  Until 2015 the Brambles Farm estate was in a ward with the Victorian terraces of North Ormesby which was more of the same: in 2011 North Ormesby and Brambles Farm ranked 11th for unemployment and was in the top 100 for no qualifications, routine work and semi-routine work.

Labour haven't had it all their own way in Middlesbrough: until 2015 the town was run by an independent elected mayor, and the Labour party won the mayoralty in 2015 very narrowly.  Things were easier for the party in Brambles and Thorntree ward that year, though: the Labour slate won with 47%, to 23% for independent candidates and 22% for UKIP.  Top of the independents was Len Junier, who was an outgoing Labour councillor for North Ormesby and Bramble Farm ward but sought re-election as an independent.  There have been no local elections in Middlesbrough since then; the Middlesbrough parliamentary seat swung slightly to the Conservatives in June 2017, but they were a long way back.

Defending for Labour is Janet Thompson, who is hoping to join her husband Mick on the council - although perhaps not for long, as Mick Thompson has been selected as Labour's prospective candidate for the Middlesbrough mayoralty when it comes up for election next year.  There is an independent candidate, Graham Wilson.  UKIP have not returned, so the Tories' David Smith (returning from 2015) and the Lib Dems' Paul Hamilton complete the ballot paper.  Whoever wins is likely to be straight back onto the campaign trail to seek re-election in May 2019.

<h2>Dee and Glenkens</h2>

Dumfries and Galloway council, Scotland; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Patsy Gilroy who had served since 1999.  She was Convenor of the council in 2007-12, and since standing down has been appointed by the Queen as Lord Lieutenant of the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright.

We finish north of the border, but very much in the borderlands.  The very name of Kirkcudbrightshire harks back to that of a man whose reputation straddled England and Scotland before England and Scotland were even thought of: the seventh-century Saint Cuthbert, who preached here when this was part of the Kingdom of Northumbria.  Cuthbert's remains were buried in the town named after him, Kirkcudbright, at one point on their journey between Lindisfarne and Durham Cathedral where they lie today.

This protracted journey for Cuthbert's remains was to keep them out of the clutches of the Norsemen, who from the ninth century were in the ascendancy in Galloway.  The area became a distinct region with a substantial Gaelic-speaking population and links over the water to the Isle of Man and the Kingdom of the Isles.  A line of independent Lords of Galloway grew up, who played off the ongoing divisions between Scotland and England for their own advantage: it wasn't until the death in 1234 of Alan, Lord of Galloway, who left no legitimate heir, that the Kings of Scotland were finally able to take control of the area.  The title of Lord of Galloway was revived in 1372 for Archibald the Grim, who was granted the revenues of all the land between the Nith and Cree rivers; he appointed a steward to collect the monies, and Kirkcudbrightshire became known as "the Stewartry"; a name which still persists today.

This is a remote and sparsely-populated area far from the main lines of communication; all the railways in Kirkcudbrightshire were closed by Beeching, and the only major road is that linking Dumfries with the port of Stranraer.  That main road studiously avoids Kirkcudbright, which with slightly over 3,000 souls is the main centre of population.  Kirkcudbright is a market town for the local area with connections to art: many artists of the Glasgow art movement were based here, and Dorothy L Sayers played on that tradition by setting her novel <em>The Five Red Herrings</em> in Kirkcudbright's artistic community.  A more surprising recent work of art associated with the area is the classic horror film <em>The Wicker Man</em>, which may be set in the Hebrides (and indeed some scenes were filmed in Plockton, where we were last week) but was mostly filmed in Kirkcudbright and the surrounding area.

This ward was created by boundary changes in 2017; it was the successor to the former Dee ward, which was the southern end of this ward based around Kirkcudbright and Gatehouse of Fleet; the name comes from the river on which Kirkcudbright stands.  Last year's changes year brought in the Glenkens area, a large expanse based on the village of New Galloway which before the 1975 reform was Scotland's smallest Royal Burgh.

Following the Conservative wipeout in Scotland in 1997 Galloway was the first part of Scotland to see a revival for them: the Tories recovered the constituency based on Galloway in 2001, but boundary changes in 2005 (which brought in the town of Dumfries) did for that.  The Dumfries and Galloway constituency voted Labour in 2005 apparently thanks to a large tactical vote by SNP supporters; this unwound in 2015 when the SNP gained the seat, but the Tories did finally break through in 2017 when Dumfries and Galloway was one of the Scottish Tory gains which kept the Conservatives in office.  The Scottish Parliament constituency based on Galloway - currently called Galloway and West Dumfries - is better territory for the Conservatives who have held it since 2003.

Kirkcudbrightshire tends to be the most Tory part of Gallwoay, and when Dee ward was created in 2007 they tried for two out of three seats.  It didn't come off: although Gilroy was re-elected for a third term, so was outgoing independent councillor Jane Maitland and there were enough SNP votes for them to win the final seat.  The Nationalists were however knocked out in 2012 by independent candidate Colin Wyper, who wyped the floor with the opposition: he topped the poll and was elected on the first count.

For the May 2017 election on the new lines Wyper retired, apparently with a severe case of disillusionment,  resulting in more major vote changes.  Patsy Gilroy polled 33% for the Tories and was easily re-elected on the first count; the SNP polled 20% and went on to win the second seat, and independent councillor Jane Maitland was re-elected thanks to Conservative transfers: she had started fourth on 14% but overtook another independent, Douglas Swan, who had 16%.  Scottish by-election blogger Allan Faulds has examined the preference profile, finding that if the 2017 election had been for one seat <a href="https://ballotbox.allanfaulds.scot/dee-and-glenkens-dumfries-and-galloway-by-election-13-12-18">Gilroy would have beaten the SNP very easily</a>.  However, this may be a red herring because examination of the candidate list shows that Colin Wyper is back on the scene, and if he can recover the support he had in 2012 Wyper could be a major contender for this by-election.

Defending for the Conservatives is Pauline Drysdale, who is a partner in a family catering firm as well as being an active charity fundraiser.  The Scottish National Party candidate is Glen Murray who has had a varied career, from being a manager at a multinational publishing company to serving on the Kirkcudbright lifeboat crew.  A gain for Murray will be a gain for the administration on Dumfries and Galloway council, which is a coalition of the SNP and Labour.  As stated, Colin Wyper is back on the scene: a caravan park manager, he is running very much on an anti-administration ticket.  A quick reminder that Votes at 16 and the Alternative Vote apply here, so if those candidates are the top three the transfers from whoever finishes third could be crucial.  Completing the ballot paper are Laura Moodie for the Green Party and Jennifer Blue for UKIP.
