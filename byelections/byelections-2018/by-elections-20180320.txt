A rare Tuesday by-election this week in the ancient city of London...

<hr>

<h2>Bishopsgate</h2>

City of London Corporation; caused by Common Councilman Prem Goyal being elected Alderman for Portsoken ward in December last year.

<blockquote>
Through crystal roofs the sunlight fell,
And pencilled beams the gloss renewed
On iron rafters balanced well
On iron struts; though dimly hued.
With smoke o'erlaid, with dust endued.
The walls and beams like beryl shone;
And dappled light the platforms strewed
With yellow foliage of the dawn
That withered by the porch of day's divan.

- John Davidson, "Liverpool Street Station"

For a rare Tuesday poll this week we are in the north-east corner of the ancient City of London.  Here can be found the mainline railway terminus of Liverpool Street, the UK's third-busiest railway station; the Broadgate development on the site of the former Broad Street railway station; and the 164m-high Broadgate Tower, completed in 2009 and the fifth-tallest building in the old City.  The map shown here is extremely up-to-date, showing as it does the tunnels for the Elizabath Line which is due to open in December 2018.

In many ways the Corporation is a hangover from the way local government was done in days of olden time, and the main effect of that hangover is business voting.  Bishopsgate ward has very few local residents and its electorate is dominated by sole traders and electors nominated by businesses located within the ward.  Those businesses run the gamut from the Swiss bank UBS, whose UK headquarters are in the Broadgate development, to Coventry University which has a small campus off Devonshire Square.

Bishopsgate ward was uncontested in the 2017 City elections but attracted three candidates for a by-election in November last year.  Six candidates were nominated for this by-election, but Dawn Wright has withdrawn and Timothy Becker had his nomination papers ruled out of order; both Wright and Becker are contesting the Billingsgate ward by-election on Thursday.  Taking the four remaining candidates in alphabetical order, Joanna Abeyie is a journalist and social campaigner who founded a company which recruits people from diverse backgrounds for jobs in the creative industry.  Adedamola Aminu is a Lambeth councillor and former Mayor of Lambeth who is standing as an official Labour candidate.  Shravan Joshi is senior warden of the Worshipful Company of Fuellers.  Completing the ballot paper, and returning from November's by-election in which he was a rather distant runner-up, is former Common Councilman for this ward and former Lib Dem figure Patrick Streeter.
