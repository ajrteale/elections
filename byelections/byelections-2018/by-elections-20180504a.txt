So the ordinary May elections are upon us.  I'm not going to try and cover all of the thousands of council seats up for election this year in the Andrew's Previews series, as I'd never finish such a piece and you'd never read it anyway.  Instead I intend to look at a few aspects of the 2018 local elections.  This piece will cover the local by-elections in councils which are <em>not</em> holding ordinary local elections this year, together with the mayoral elections; and a companion piece will look in some detail at your columnist's own county of Greater Manchester.

<h2>Sheffield City Region</h2>

Let's start at the top of the pile, shall we?  Unquestionably the largest single position being elected this year is the Mayor of the Sheffield City Region, the latest piece of the puzzle in the government's regional devolution strategy.  

This poll was originally supposed to take place last year, but got deferred for a year mainly thanks to disputes over what area the Sheffield City Region should cover.  It doesn't help that Sheffield is hard up against the Yorkshire boundary, and indeed quite a lot of the present Sheffield council area has been annexed from Derbyshire over the years.  Pretty much anything in the Sheffield commuter belt south of the city itself is outside Yorkshire.  
And that has been the root of the delay.  Bassetlaw council in Nottinghamshire and a number of Derbyshire districts had experessed interest in joining the City Region, but Derbyshire county council wasn't as keen and launched legal action to stop the 2017 election going ahead.  The withdrawal of Bassetlaw and the Derbyshire districts has meant that the electors for the Sheffield City Region mayor are only those who live in the four metropolitan boroughs of South Yorkshire.  

But even those four boroughs can't agree on what their devolution deal should look like. Barnsley and Doncaster had expressed support for a devolution arrangement covering the whole of Yorkshire, an idea which also has support from several other Yorkshire councils particularly in West Yorkshire.  So it's quite possible that this mayoral post may not exist for very long at all before it gets subsumed into something bigger.

We wait and see, and in any event it's unlikely that this election will be an exciting one.  There have been three previous elections for a county-wide post in South Yorkshire, all for the Police and Crime Commissioner.  The first one was the farcical PCC election in November 2012, which was noted for its comedy low turnout but still safely returned Labour candidate Shaun Wright in the first round.  The English Democrats, who at the time held the Doncaster mayoralty, were a distant second.  Wright had come to the police and crime commissionership from Rotherham, where he had been councillor in charge of children's services; and when the Rotherham child sexual exploitation scandal broke two years later, he was forced to resign.  The resulting by-election in October 2014 elected Labour candidate Alan Billings, a priest and former deputy leader of Sheffield council, in the first round, with UKIP second.  Revd Billings was safely re-elected for a full term in 2016, polling 52% to 20% for UKIP and 11% for the Conservatives.

The 2017 general election showed yet again that Labour are in the ascendancy across South Yorkshire.  They carried all 14 of the county's constituencies, gaining Sheffield Hallam from Nick Clegg, and polled 57% across the four boroughs to 30% for the Conservatives.

So really the question here is whether the Labour candidate will win in the first round.  He is Dan Jarvis, who came to politics from a career in the military.  From Sandhurst he was commissioned into the Parachute Regiment, ending with the rank of Major and a military MBE, and served in Northern Ireland, Kosovo, Sierra Leone, Iraq and Afghanistan (twice).  Jarvis resigned his commission in 2011 when he was selected as Labour candidate for the Barnsley Central by-election, after former MP Eric Illsley was convicted of fraud charges arising fro the Parliamentary expenses scandal.  By this time Jarvis' first wife had died from cancer at the age of just 43, leaving him as a single parent of two children

Jarvis rose up the parliamentary ranks even more quickly than he had done in the Army; within a year of his election he was in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet, and there was speculation that he would stand for the Labour leadership in the 2015 election.  In the event, Jarvis decided to put his family first (by now he had remarried and had a young child with his second wife) and endorsed Andy Burnham.  Fat lot of good that did him, and Jarvis has not featured in Corbyn's shadow cabinets.  With his career stalled at Westminster, presumably Jarvis feels that being a regional mayor would be a better use of his skills.

This by-election will be combined with elections to two of the four South Yorkshire boroughs: Doncaster council was moved away from thirds elections in an attempt to combat longstanding political instability, while Rotherham suffered the same fate after the child sexual exploitation scandal revealed that the council, to put it charitably, hadn't been paying attention to what was going on in their bailiwick.  The Commissioners which central government sent in after the scandal are still there and still running Rotherham's children's services.  That leaves Sheffield city council and Barnsley council electing a third of their councillors; despite a local controversy in Sheffield over extensive tree-felling, in neither of those councils do Labour look under serious threat of losing their majority.

<h2>Other mayoral elections</h2>

Five local government mayors are up for re-election this year.  The stand-out one to watch is Watford, where Baroness Thornhill is standing down after four terms of office.  Despite the Lib Dems' travails nationally they are strong in Watford at local level.  Thornhill was re-elected in 2014 for her final term by defeating Labour 65-35 in the runoff; in the 2016 local elections the Lib Dems won 25 seats to 11 for Labour, and polled 39% to 26% for Labour and 20% for the Conservatives, who won nothing.  Councillor Peter Taylor is the new Liberal Democrat candidate, 2014 runner-up and Labour candidate Cllr Jagtar Singh Dhindsa tries again, and the Conservatives have selectd George Jabbour.

The other four mayoral elections on 3rd May are in Greater London and are all Labour defences.  Tower Hamlets is probably the one to watch, just to see what shenanigans happen this time.  Labour's John Biggs, who won the mayoral by-election in 2015 after Lutfur Rahman was unseated by the Election Court for a corrupt 2014 election campaign, is seeking re-election for a full term.  Lutfur Rahman is disqualified from voting or holding elected office until 2020, but the Lutfurites have not gone away.  Their candidate Rabina Khan lost the 2015 by-election to Biggs by the relatively narrow margin of 55-45.  On the other hand, the Lutfurites have split into two factions: Rabina Khan is trying again with the nomination of PATH, the People's Alliance of Tower Hamlets, while former deputy mayor Oliur Rahman is standing for the more hardline Aspire party.  Also standing are Anwara Ali for the Conservatives and Elaine Bagshaw for the Lib Dems.  Those who remember the appalling and embarassing shambles which was the Tower Hamlets count in 2014 will no doubt be praying that there will be no repeat this time.

The Newham mayoralty has never been far from political controversy either, but the interesting element of the 2018 Newham election has already happened: outgoing mayor Sir Robin Wales was deselected by Labour, after four terms of office, in favour of new candidate Rokhsana Fiaz.  She will have no problem being elected in this one-party state. 

Another four-term mayor standing down - voluntary this time - is Lewisham's Sir Steve Bullock.  The new Labour candidate is Damian Egan, who sits in Bullock's cabinet and is outgoing councillor for Lewisham Central ward; he should have little problem being elected.  Outgoing Hackney mayor Philip Glanville should be similarly untroubled; he won a by-election in 2016 after former mayor Jules Pipe left to join Sadiq Khan's administration in City Hall, and now has the chance to win a full term of his own.
