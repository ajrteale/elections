Before we start this week, there is a regrettable entry for Correction Corner.  Christopher Millington, who contested the Toddbrook by-election in Harlow last week, was representing the Liberal Democrats and not, as I wrote, the Green Party.  My apologies to all involved.

There are three by-elections on 20th December 2018, all Liberal Democrat defences:

<hr/>

<h2>Kent Estuary</h2>

Cumbria county council; and

<h2>Arnside and Milnthorpe</h2>

South Lakeland council, Cumbria; both caused by the death of Liberal Democrat councillor Ian Stewart.
