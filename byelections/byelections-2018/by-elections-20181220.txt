Before we start this week, there is a regrettable entry for Correction Corner.  Christopher Millington, who contested the Toddbrook by-election in Harlow last week, was representing the Liberal Democrats and not, as I wrote, the Green Party.  My apologies to all involved.

There are three by-elections on 20th December 2018, all Liberal Democrat defences:

<h2>Anstey</h2>

Charnwood council, Leicestershire; caused by the death of John Sutherington who was the only Liberal Democrat member of the council.

Well, last week was exciting, wasn't it?  Yes, the big vote on Wednesday was a crushing win for the Ashfield Independents in Sutton-in-Ashfield, further proof that the voters of that corner of Nottinghamshire have confidence in the strong and stable leadership of Jason Zadrozny.  Watch that man for the future, his star is in the ascendancy.  Yes, last week was very difficult to write about because the pace of events on the national scene is just so fast these days.  Not even satire can keep up: my Previews last week went through several last-minute redrafts and still ended up very dated.  With Parliament yet to break up for the Christmas recess at the time of writing, there is still time for Things to Happen before you read this.

One of the other by-elections last week was in the council estates of Middlesbrough, a place which has been left behind by the death of its major industries and which - not coincidentally - came out in favour of leaving the EU those thirty long months ago.  This is not a new phenomenon: technological change has been leaving places and people behind for a very long time, going back all the way to the Industrial Revolution and before.  And for almost as long, people have been railing against technological change.  Back in 1779, there was allegedly an incident in which a semi-legendary man called Edward Ludlam smashed up a couple of newfangled stocking frames in a spasm of rage; some decades later, his name - shortened to Ned Ludd - became appropriated for the Luddite protst movement against mechanisation and the industrial abuses which stemmed from it.

Ned Ludd, or Edward Ludlum, was from Anstey: a village on the edge of Charnwood Foresta few miles north of Leicester.  Anstey is one of those awkward places to classify in that it's too large to be a village but too small to be a town, and that was also the case back in the nineteenth century when, despite Ludd's efforts, there was a thriving textile industry here with multiple hosiery factories.  By the twentieth century there were other industries in Anstey - boots and shoes, wallpaper, tanning - and there is still a factory here making packaging together with the book publishers Ulverscroft, which specialises in large print books for those with poor eyesight.  Anstey's industry has, however, declined; and with its proximity to Leicester housebuilding has been the order of the day more recently.  One street of new-build houses just off the main road to Leicester has been called, without a hint of irony, Ned Ludd Close.

Another road in Anstey was recently named after another local man.  John Sutherington had represented the village on Charnwood council since 1999, from that year to 2003 as part of the former Bradgate ward, and was clearly well thought-of as a local councillor.  He was born in Anstey in 1949 and lived here for the whole of his life, being a talented sportsman and musician in addition to his work and democratic duties.  Unfortunately his last five years were blighted by aplastic anaemia, a bone marrow condition, and by becoming the victim of a telephone banking scam which cost him Â£20,000.

Sutherington had a clear personal vote, holding his seat easily in the 2007 election when his Lib Dem running-mate lost to the Conservatives.  At his final re-election in 2015 that must have made all the difference because he held his seat by just sixteen votes over the second Conservative candidate.  The lead Tory candidate that year had 34%, Sutherington as a single Lib Dem polled 26%, with UKIP and Labour on 16% each.  The Conservatives normally have a better time at county council level: Anstey is part of the Bradgate division which is safe for the Tories.

John Sutherington was the last Liberal Democrat member of Charnwood council, and one suspects that with his passing there was nobody left to take up the Lib Dem baton in the area.  In any event there is no defending Lib Dem candidate, so this by-election will form an early Christmas present for the either the Conservative or Labour Parties.  In the blue corner is Paul Baines, who is one of the few local election candidates notable enough to merit his own Wikipedia entry: Baines is a Professor of Political Marketing at the University of Leicester and has witten several books on the subject, so now he has the chance to put his theory into practice.  In the red corner is Glyn McAllister, vice-chairman of Anstey parish council and regular Labour candidate for the ward.  With UKIP not returning, this is a straight fight.
