Fourteen by-elections on Thursday 15th February 2018:

<h2>Higham Ferrers</h2>

Northamptonshire county council; and

<h2>Higham Ferrers Lancaster</h2>

East Northamptonshire council; both caused by the death of Conservative councillor Glenn Harwood.  A veteran of the Falklands War who served for forty yeears in the Army, retiring with an MBE and the rank of Lietenant-Colonel, Harwood was elected to East Northamptonshire council in 2007, and at the time of his death was deputy leader of the council.  In May 2017 he was elected to Northamptonshire county council.

It's appropriate to start this week in Northamptonshire, which is the location for the biggest and most controversial story to have come out of local government so far in this young year.  Earlier this month Northamptonshire county council issued a Section 114 notice, banning all new expenditure with the exception of statutory services for protecting vulnerable people.  Essentially, the council has run out of money and gone bust.  Proposals for remedying this include raising council tax by almost 6%, and selling the council's new headquarters building which was built at a cost of £53 million and has only been open for four months.  These proposals haven't gone down well with Northamptonshire's seven MPs - all Conservatives - who have called for the government to send in commissioners, nor have they gone done well with half of the county council's Conservative group, with 21 backbench councillors signing a statement saying that they are appalled by what has been revealed regarding the council's finances.

The voters of Higham Ferrers will have an early chance to say what they think of all this, as well as proposals for a large "US-stlye" chicken farm in the area.  This is a market town in eastern Northamptonshire, overlooking the River Nene, which is just north of and has fused with the larger town of Rushden.  Higham - from Old English words meaning "high homestead" is a common name in the UK and so the suffix "Ferrers" was added; this is a reference to William de Ferrers, fifth earl of Derby of the first creation, who created the borough in 1251.  The present Earl Ferrers, the senior Earl in the British peerage, is a descendant of William de Ferrers - although the upper class is not what it was and the present earl has to go to work as an accountant.  Higham Ferrers' economy was traditionally based on shoemaking and footwear, and some of this trade still survives in the town today.

Lancaster ward is the eastern of Higham Ferrers' two district wards and also takes in the parish of Chelveston cum Caldecott to the east.  The county division covers the whole of Higham Ferrers together with part of Rushden to the south.

This is a very Conservative area.  Higham Ferrers Lancaster ward was created on its current boundaries in May 2007, when the Conservative slate beat Labour 71-29 in a straight fight.  Nobody has challenged the Tories in the ward since then, so you have to look to county level for clues as to how the town's political allegiances have changed over the last eleven years.  Last year's county election in the Higham Ferrers division suggest that the changes since 2007 don't amount to much: the Conservatives beat Labour 60-19.

Defending the county seat for the Conservatives is Jason Smithers, a cafe-owner and deputy mayor of Higham Ferrers.  The Labour candidate is Gary Day.  At district level the Lancaster ward by-election is contested: the Conservatives have gone for youth in selecting Harriet Pentland to defend the seat, while the Labour candidate is businessman Mark Green.  Both ballot papers are completed by Suzanna Austin for the Lib Dems, Bill Cross for UKIP and Simon Turner for the Green Party.

<h2>Worstead</h2>

North Norfolk council; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Glyn Williams on health grounds.  He was first elected in 2011 as a Liberal Democrat and defected to the Conservatives in 2013.

We travel east to consider two by-elections in East Anglia.  Worstead is a village with a famous name but not a population to match.  The village came to prominence in the twelfth century when Flemish weavers arrived in the area, who became so successful that a type of yarn - worsted - was named after the village.  At 922 souls Worstead is too small to be a ward on its own, and the ward named after it contains five other parishes to the west and north-west, as far as Suffield.  Worstead railway station - on the Bittern Line from Norwich to Sheringham - links the ward to the outside world.

By-elections in Liberal Democrat constituencies don't come around very often, so savour this one.  The Liberal Democrats held this ward from 2003 (when the current ward boundaries came in) to 2013 when their councillor Glyn Williams defected to the Conservatives.  He was re-elected under his new colours in 2015, polling 42% to 33% for the Lib Dems and 13% for the Green Party.  The 2015 election re-elected the Conservatives to majority control of North Norfolk, but they have since suffered a mass of defections: of the 33 Conservative councillors elected in 2015 only 22 remain plus this vacancy, and the party has lost overall control of the council.  The local county division - North Walsham East and Erpingham - is a three-way marginal with a strong Labour vote but has consistently voted Lib Dem since 2005.

Defending for the Conservatives is Robin Russell-Pavier, who has travelled the world working in the holiday industry and now works as a tourism consultant.  The Lib Dems will want this seat back and have selected Saul Penfold (oh crumbs!), the chair of governors at Worstead CofE primary school who is a former teacher and former head of education at Norwich Cathedral.  With the Greens withdrawing, completing the ballot paper is carpenter, builder and former district councillor David Spencer for Labour.

<h2>St Pauls</h2>

Tendring council, Essex; caused by the resignation of councillor Jack Parsons.  Parsons was originally elected for UKIP, had defected to Labour, and at the time of his resignation was sitting as an independent.  Last year he was sentenced to 70 hours' unpaid work by Colchester magistrates for possessing a knife in a public place.  

Parsons' resignation from the council was bizarre; he had sent a draft resignation email to council bosses by mistake, and unsuccessfully tried to retract it.  Unlike a case we shall come to next week (TODO: check this), Parsons has decided that resignation is the best course of action for him as he battles problems with depression and anxiety.  This column wishes Parsons the best of luck in recovering good mental health.

<h2>Ruxley</h2>

Epsom and Ewell council, Surrey; caused by the resignation of Keith Partridge who was a councillor for the West Ewell and Ruxley Residents Association.  He had served since 2015.

For our London-area by-election this week we travel to Surrey.  The town of Ewell has been swallowed up by the growth of London but remains outside the Greater London boundary.  Ewell is an affluent commuter are but Ruxley ward is perhaps its most downmarket part: located in West Ewell and named after Ruxley Lane, the ward is hard up against the Greater London boundary at Chessington and has Epsom and Ewell's lowest proportion of the workforce in the census "higher management" occupational group.

For many years now Epsom and Ewell has been dominated at borough level by Residents Association candidates.  Ruxley ward is no different: in the 2015 election the Residents had a clean sweep, gaining two seats from the Conservatives against the national trend.  That year the Residents polled 45% to 32% for the Conservatives and 14% for Labour.  The Residents also hold the local county division, West Ewell.

Defending for the Residents is Alex Coley, a former civil servant who was first Head of Digital Services for the Metropolitan Police, and now runs a digital communications and technology company.  The Conservative candidate is Stephen Pontin who was a councillor for this ward from 2007 to 2011, and is seeking to return to the council.  Labou have selected Themba Msika, a mental health nurse.  Completing the ballot paper is Julia Kirkland for the Liberal Democrats.

<h2>Chudleigh; and<br/>
Dawlish Central and North East</h2>

Teignbridge council, Devon; caused respectively by the resignations of Doug Laing and Graham Price, who were both Conservative councillors.

Laing, who was the council's outgoing cabinet member for economy and tourism, is now serving a three-year prison sentence for wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.   That charge related to an attack on his wife Susan at their home on 29 October last year.  Laing had originally been charged with attempted murder, but denied that charge and a trial was not pursued after he pleaded guilty to the lesser offence.
