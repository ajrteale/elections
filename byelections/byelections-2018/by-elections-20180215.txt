Fourteen by-elections on Thursday 15th February 2018:

<hr/>

<h2>Higham Ferrers</h2>

Northamptonshire county council; and

<h2>Higham Ferrers Lancaster</h2>

East Northamptonshire council; both caused by the death of Conservative councillor Glenn Harwood.  A veteran of the Falklands War who served for forty yeears in the Army, retiring with an MBE and the rank of Lietenant-Colonel, Harwood was elected to East Northamptonshire council in 2007, and at the time of his death was deputy leader of the council.  In May 2017 he was elected to Northamptonshire county council.

It's appropriate to start this week in Northamptonshire, which is the location for the biggest and most controversial story to have come out of local government so far in this young year.  Earlier this month Northamptonshire county council issued a Section 114 notice, banning all new expenditure with the exception of statutory services for protecting vulnerable people.  Essentially, the council has run out of money and gone bust.  Proposals for remedying this include raising council tax by almost 6%, and selling the council's new headquarters building which was built at a cost of £53 million and has only been open for four months.  These proposals haven't gone down well with Northamptonshire's seven MPs - all Conservatives - who have called for the government to send in commissioners, nor have they gone done well with half of the county council's Conservative group, with 21 backbench councillors signing a statement saying that they are appalled by what has been revealed regarding the council's finances.

The voters of Higham Ferrers will have an early chance to say what they think of all this, as well as proposals for a large "US-stlye" chicken farm in the area.  This is a market town in eastern Northamptonshire, overlooking the River Nene, which is just north of and has fused with the larger town of Rushden.  Higham - from Old English words meaning "high homestead" is a common name in the UK and so the suffix "Ferrers" was added; this is a reference to William de Ferrers, fifth earl of Derby of the first creation, who created the borough in 1251.  The present Earl Ferrers, the senior Earl in the British peerage, is a descendant of William de Ferrers - although the upper class is not what it was and the present earl has to go to work as an accountant.  Higham Ferrers' economy was traditionally based on shoemaking and footwear, and some of this trade still survives in the town today.

Lancaster ward is the eastern of Higham Ferrers' two district wards and also takes in the parish of Chelveston cum Caldecott to the east.  The county division covers the whole of Higham Ferrers together with part of Rushden to the south.

This is a very Conservative area.  Higham Ferrers Lancaster ward was created on its current boundaries in May 2007, when the Conservative slate beat Labour 71-29 in a straight fight.  Nobody has challenged the Tories in the ward since then, so you have to look to county level for clues as to how the town's political allegiances have changed over the last eleven years.  Last year's county election in the Higham Ferrers division suggest that the changes since 2007 don't amount to much: the Conservatives beat Labour 60-19.

Defending the county seat for the Conservatives is Jason Smithers, a cafe-owner and deputy mayor of Higham Ferrers.  The Labour candidate is Gary Day.  At district level the Lancaster ward by-election is contested: the Conservatives have gone for youth in selecting Harriet Pentland to defend the seat, while the Labour candidate is businessman Mark Green.  Both ballot papers are completed by Suzanna Austin for the Lib Dems, Bill Cross for UKIP and Simon Turner for the Green Party.

<h2>Worstead</h2>

North Norfolk council; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Glyn Williams on health grounds.  He was first elected in 2011 as a Liberal Democrat and defected to the Conservatives in 2013.

We travel east to consider two by-elections in East Anglia.  Worstead is a village with a famous name but not a population to match.  The village came to prominence in the twelfth century when Flemish weavers arrived in the area, who became so successful that a type of yarn - worsted - was named after the village.  At 922 souls Worstead is too small to be a ward on its own, and the ward named after it contains five other parishes to the west and north-west, as far as Suffield.  Worstead railway station - on the Bittern Line from Norwich to Sheringham - links the ward to the outside world.

By-elections in Liberal Democrat constituencies don't come around very often, so savour this one.  The Liberal Democrats held this ward from 2003 (when the current ward boundaries came in) to 2013 when their councillor Glyn Williams defected to the Conservatives.  He was re-elected under his new colours in 2015, polling 42% to 33% for the Lib Dems and 13% for the Green Party.  The 2015 election re-elected the Conservatives to majority control of North Norfolk, but they have since suffered a mass of defections: of the 33 Conservative councillors elected in 2015 only 22 remain plus this vacancy, and the party has lost overall control of the council.  The local county division - North Walsham East and Erpingham - is a three-way marginal with a strong Labour vote but has consistently voted Lib Dem since 2005.

Defending for the Conservatives is Robin Russell-Pavier, who has travelled the world working in the holiday industry and now works as a tourism consultant.  The Lib Dems will want this seat back and have selected Saul Penfold (oh crumbs!), the chair of governors at Worstead CofE primary school who is a former teacher and former head of education at Norwich Cathedral.  With the Greens withdrawing, completing the ballot paper is carpenter, builder and former district councillor David Spencer for Labour.

<h2>St Pauls</h2>

Tendring council, Essex; caused by the resignation of councillor Jack Parsons.  Parsons was originally elected for UKIP, had defected to Labour, and at the time of his resignation was sitting as an independent.  Last year he was sentenced to 70 hours' unpaid work by Colchester magistrates for possessing a knife in a public place.  

Parsons' resignation from the council was bizarre; he had sent a draft resignation email to council bosses by mistake, and unsuccessfully tried to retract it.  Unlike a case we shall come to next week (TODO: check this), Parsons has decided that resignation is the best course of action for him as he battles problems with depression and anxiety.  This column wishes Parsons the best of luck in recovering good mental health.

<h2>Ruxley</h2>

Epsom and Ewell council, Surrey; caused by the resignation of Keith Partridge who was a councillor for the West Ewell and Ruxley Residents Association.  He had served since 2015.

For our London-area by-election this week we travel to Surrey.  The town of Ewell has been swallowed up by the growth of London but remains outside the Greater London boundary.  Ewell is an affluent commuter are but Ruxley ward is perhaps its most downmarket part: located in West Ewell and named after Ruxley Lane, the ward is hard up against the Greater London boundary at Chessington and has Epsom and Ewell's lowest proportion of the workforce in the census "higher management" occupational group.

For many years now Epsom and Ewell has been dominated at borough level by Residents Association candidates.  Ruxley ward is no different: in the 2015 election the Residents had a clean sweep, gaining two seats from the Conservatives against the national trend.  That year the Residents polled 45% to 32% for the Conservatives and 14% for Labour.  The Residents also hold the local county division, West Ewell.

Defending for the Residents is Alex Coley, a former civil servant who was first Head of Digital Services for the Metropolitan Police, and now runs a digital communications and technology company.  The Conservative candidate is Stephen Pontin who was a councillor for this ward from 2007 to 2011, and is seeking to return to the council.  Labou have selected Themba Msika, a mental health nurse.  Completing the ballot paper is Julia Kirkland for the Liberal Democrats.

<h2>Carterton South</h2>

West Oxfordshire council; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Mick Brennan.  He had served since 2011, and was a contractor at RAF Brize Norton after 30 years' service in the Royal Air Force.

We move west from London to a ward which is dominated by the military.  The town of Carterton has grown to become the second-largest town in West Oxfordshire district (after Witney), and the main reason for that is its proximity to RAF Brize Norton.  The UK's largest RAF base, Brize Norton opened in 1937 and saw much activity in the Second World War, before being used by the US Air Force who deployed nuclear bombers here.  The RAF took the base back in 1965, and it is now the point of embarkation for British troops overseas and the main operating base for the RAF's transport and refuelling aircraft.

Many of Brize Norton's buildings and part of its apron are within the ward boundary, and the military personnel have left their mark on its demographics.  Carterton South is in the top 10 wards in England and Wales for full-time employment (a staggering 62% of the workforce), in the top 10 wards for those educated to Level 2 (five or more GCSE passes or equivalent), and in the top 20 wards for the census "intermediate" employment category.

What the military tend not to do is turn out in local elections, so the town will punch above its weight when the votes are counted.  Despite a Liberal Democrat win in 2007 - by one vote - this is a safe Conservative ward like the other two Carterton wards.  At the most recent district election in 2015 the Conservatives beat UKIP here 62-15, and in May's county elections the Conservatives had a 70-12 lead over Labour in the Carterton South and West division.  One of the former councillors for this ward was Windell "Joe" Walcott, who served as Mayor of Carterton and was appointed MBE but is perhaps better known as the grandfather of the footballer Theo Walcott.

Defending for the Conservatives is Michele Mead, a Carterton town councillor.  With UKIP not returning, she is opposed by Simon Adderley for Labour and Ben Lines for the Liberal Democrats.

<h2>Chudleigh; and<br/>
Dawlish Central and North East</h2>

Teignbridge council, Devon; caused respectively by the resignations of Doug Laing and Graham Price, who were both Conservative councillors.  Laing had served since 2015, Price - a former chairman of Teignbridge council - since 2007.

Laing, who was the council's outgoing cabinet member for economy and tourism, is now serving a three-year prison sentence for wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.   That charge related to an attack on his wife Susan at their home on 29 October last year.  Laing had originally been charged with attempted murder, but denied that charge and a trial was not pursued after he pleaded guilty to the lesser offence.

Not the most propitious of circumstances for one of our two by-elections in the West Country today.  Both of these are in the Teignbridge district.  Chudleigh can be found on the eastern slopes of Dartmoor; it's a commuter town for Exeter which is bypassed by the A38 Exeter-Plymouth road - and the importance of that bypass to the local road network is demonstrated by the fact that before it was built, the road closures for the Chudleigh carnival each summer could lead to 25-mile tailbacks.  Although the Chudley Cannons have been playing Quidditch in the village since 1753 (according to JK Rowling, and I'm not going to contradict that), there is no word on how the team was affected by a major fire in 1807 which essentially destroyed Chudleigh, leaving only the church and seven houses standing.  The ward also extends to the north to take in Hennock parish, part of which is within the Dartmoor National Park - although that parish will move out of the ward in boundary changes to be implemented next year.

Down on the seafront can be found the town of Dawlish, which developed in the eighteenth century as a seaside resort.  Jane Austen spent a long holiday here in 1802, complaining at length at the state of the town's library, and the place appears in novels by both her and Dickens.  Running along the seafront is the West of England main line, opened by Brunel in 1846 and with its trains originally run by pneumatic tubes - a failed experiment.  The main line is one of the most scenic in Britain thanks to its seafront location, but also expensive to maintain - part of it was washed away in a storm in 2014, leaving the West Country cut off from the rail network for several weeks.  The North and East ward covers the northern half of the town plus the village of Dawlish Warren, whose economy is entirely geared towards holidays and tourism.

Chudleigh ward has unchanged boundaries since 1979.  It has traditionally returned independent candidates to Teignbridge council, with the first party candidate to break that pattern being Labour in their zenith year of 1995; the Labour seat was lost back to the independents in a November 1996 by-election.  It took until 2003 for party candidates to get in on the act again with the election of a Lib Dem to one of the two seats in 2003; the Tories gained the Lib Dem seat in 2007 and the remaining independent seat in the 2015 election to hold both seats in the ward for the first time.  That 2015 election was a rather fragmented result, with 33% for the Tory slate of Laing and Patricia Johnson-King, 25% for outgoing independent councillor Richard Keeling and 15% each for Labour and the Greens.  Johnson-King died in 2016 and the Conservatives lost the resulting by-election to Keeling, who stood with the Liberal Democrat nomination: he beat the Conservatives 52-36.  Keeling was also the local Lib Dem candidate in the county elections last year, coming a strong second in the safe Conservative division of Chudleigh and Teign Valley.

The Conservatives are generally stronger in Dawlish North and East where they have won two or all of the three seats in every election this century.  The exceptions were a Lib Dem win in 2003 and an independent win in 2011.  The Conservatives regained the independent seat in 2015 in a fragmented result: they had 35% to 27% for the Lib Dems, 20% for the independent slate and 18% for the Greens.  The Tories had a larger lead over the Lib Dems in May's county elections in Dawlish division.

Dawlish town council's website advertises the place as the "home of the black swan", and having one of your councillors sent to prison for attacking his wife with a mallet certainly counts as a black swan event for the Teignbridge Conservatives.  The difficult task, given those circumstances, of holding Chudleigh for the Tories falls to Pam Elliott.  Hospital manager Lorraine Evans is hoping to gain for the Liberal Democrats: an interesting selection as Evans was the ward's Conservative councillor from 2007 to 2015, losing re-election in 2015 as an independent candidate.  Returning from the 2016 by-election is Labour candidate Janette Parker, who completes a rare all-female ballot paper.

The Dawlish Central and North East by-election is a straight fight with no independent or Green candidates.  Defending in the blue corner is Angela Fenne, a Dawlish town councillor and traffic officer at Highways England.  Challenging in the yellow corner is Martin Wrigley, the present Mayor of Dawlish, who works in the telecom and IT sector.

<h2>Grassmoor</h2>

North East Derbyshire council; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Julie Hill who had served since 2015.

It's time to go north as we consider the first of this week's five by-elections in England north of the Trent.  We stay in the Midlands for the first poll, which is in a ward based on the villages of Grassmoor and Temple Normanton just to the south-east of Chesterfield.  This was a coalmining area, with a series of deep and opencast pits which have now all gone; much of the former pit site, including the once-severely polluted Grassmoor Lagoons, have been landscaped into the Grassmoor Country Park.  Grassmoor's most famous son is Paul Burrell, the former butler to Diana, Princess of Wales.

This is a ward where Labour are not seriously challenged at district council level.  The Labour slate was unopposed in 2003, and in 2015 beat UKIP here 59-24.  However, it is part of the North East Derbyshire constituency which was a rare Conservative gain in June 2017, and part of this ward is covered by the Clay Cross North county division which was marginal between Labour and the Liberal Democrats in May 2017.  Clay Cross North also includes the neighbouring Tupton ward, where the Lib Dems came from nowhere to win a council by-election in 2016.

Defending for Labour is Dick Marriott.  With UKIP not returning for this by-election, Marriott is opposed by Josh Broadhurst for the Conservatives and Ben Marshall for the Liberal Democrats.
