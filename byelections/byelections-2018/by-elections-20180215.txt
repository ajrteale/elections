Fourteen by-elections on Thursday 15th February 2018:

<hr/>

<h2>Chudleigh; and<br/>
Dawlish Central and North East</h2>

Teignbridge council, Devon; caused respectively by the resignations of Doug Laing and Graham Price, who were both Conservative councillors.

Laing, who was the council's outgoing cabinet member for economy and tourism, is now serving a three-year prison sentence for wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.   That charge related to an attack on his wife Susan at their home on 29 October last year.  Laing had originally been charged with attempted murder, but denied that charge and a trial was not pursued after he pleaded guilty to the lesser offence.

<hr/>

<h2>St Pauls</h2>

Tendring council, Essex; caused by the resignation of councillor Jack Parsons.  Parsons was originally elected for UKIP, had defected to Labour, and at the time of his resignation was sitting as an independent.  Last year he was sentenced to 70 hours' unpaid work by Colchester magistrates for possessing a knife in a public place.  

Parsons' resignation from the council was bizarre; he had sent a draft resignation email to council bosses by mistake, and unsuccessfully tried to retract it.  Unlike a case we shall come to next week (TODO: check this), Parsons has decided that resignation is the best course of action for him as he battles problems with depression and anxiety.  This column wishes Parsons the best of luck in recovering good mental health.
