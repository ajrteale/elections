There are eleven polls on Thursday 21st June 2018, all in England and all but one south of the Watford Gap.

<h2>Alcombe</h2>

West Somerset council; caused by the resignation of UKIP councillor Adrian Behan who had served since 2015.

I'll start this week in the south-west of England by saying farewell.  This will almost certainly be the last by-election held to West Somerset district council, which is being abolished in May 2019: it will merge with the neighbouring Taunton Deane district to form a new district council with the appalling name of "Somerset West and Taunton".  Most likely it was West Somerset council which drove this merger: with a population under 35,000 it is the smallest second-tier local government district in England.  Until last month there were some electoral <em>wards</em> in Birmingham with that sort of headcount, and 35,000 souls in a rugged area of the country is not really enough of a base to support the sort of services which local government is expected to provide these days.  Several tiny district councils in Dorset are going in 2019 as well; as Rutland has unitary status, Melton borough in Leicestershire will take over next year as the smallest shire district by population.

Alcombe is the south-eastern of the four wards covering Minehead, West Somerset's largest population centre, and is effectively a village which has been swallowed up by the town.  The name Minehead is cognate with the Welsh word for mountain, <em>mynydd</em>, nicely describing its location at the foot of Exmoor; indeed parts of Alcombe ward lie within the Exmoor National Park.  With Minehead being dependent on tourism for its economy - Butlins is still a major employer - jobs here are not well-paid, and Alcombe ward's census return has high scores in the working-class occupation groups.

Not that you'd guess that from Alcombe's election results, which are fragmented.  The ward elects two West Somerset councillors, but since it was created in 2011 none of the parties have stood more than one candidate here.  In 2011 the poll was topped by Ian Melhuish, outgoing independent councillor for the predecessor ward of Alcombe East, with the Tories winning the other seat.  Melhuish lost his seat to UKIP in 2015: shares of the vote were 26% for the Conservatives, 22% for UKIP, 19% for Labour, 18% for Melhuish and 14% for the Green Party.  At county council level this is part of the Dunster division which is safely Conservative; and next year it will form part of the Dunster ward to elect three Somerset West and Taunton district councillors.

With no defending UKIP candidate we have a free-for-all.  The Conservatives have selected Minehead town councillor Andy Parbrook, who is hoping to join on the district council his wife Jean.  Another Andrew on the ballot paper is Labour's Andrew Mountford, who runs a B&B in the town.  Stephenie Stephens is standing as an independent candidate, and with the Greens not returning Nicole Hawkins of the Liberal Democrats completes the ballot paper.

<h2>Kempshott</h2>

Basingstoke and Deane council, Hampshire; caused by the disqualification of Conservative councillor Anne Court, who failed to attend any meetings in six months.

http://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/basingstoke-deane-kempshott.png

We've been here before, haven't we?  Yes, this is the second Kempshott by-election in four months as we make a return visit to the western edge of Basingstoke.  This is an area which was developed for housing in the 1970s and early 1980s as the town of Basingstoke greatly expanded thanks to London overspill.  Previously this area had been part of Kempshott Park, an estate held from 1789 by the future George IV who spent his honeymoon with Caroline of Brunswick here.  A bit of a stepdown from Alberta where the Sussexes reportedly honeymooned, but fashions were different in the eighteenth century.  George and Caroline's Kempshott House is no more - it was demolished to make way for the M3 motorway - but the modern Kempshott houses are very much here and very much owner-occupied - 91% of the ward's households have that tenure, putting Kempshott in the top 100 wards in England and Wales.

This is a safe Tory ward where the party is not seriously challenged.  It's the third time in four months that Kempshott voters have been called to the polls, so there may be an element of voter fatigue; however, the March poll, despite being on the first day of spring, was on a day of heavy snow which clearly affected turnout.  Snow is unlikely to be a factor in mid-June.  The Tory lead here was 59-31 over Labour in the March by-election, rising to 67-21 in the May ordinary election.

The ballot paper has an unusual feature: the defending Conservative candidate is Anne Court, standing for re-election in the by-election caused by her own disqualification.  She had been a Basingstoke councillor since 1995, and was Mayor of Basingstoke and Deane in 2015-16.  Late last year Court had a routine knee operation which led to severe post-operative complications: a second operation and a prolonged recovery period saved her leg from being amputated, but it was a close-run thing and that prolonged recovery period meant that she fell foul of the six-month non-attendance rule.  This column has seen a few examples of councillors standing for re-election in similar circumstances, and they do usually get back in; with the big Tory lead here and Court's long previous service for the ward this is likely to be another such case.  Hoping that won't happen is Labour candidate Grant Donohoe, a teacher who stood in March's by-election and is hoping to go from second to first this time round.  Completing the Kempshott ballot paper, as she did in March's by-election and May's ordinary election, is the Lib Dems' Stavroulla O'Doherty.

<h2>Bicester West</h2>

Cherwell council, Oxfordshire; postponed from 3rd May following the death of outgoing Conservative councillor Jolanta Lis, who was standing for re-election.  The Mayor of Bicester in 2016-17, Lis was elected to Cherwell council in 2016 and at the time of her death was vice-chairman of the coucil.

From one fast-growing town we move to another.  Bicester has an old history, being established by the West Saxons in the sixth century close to a junction of Roman roads; but its population has exploded since the Second World War.  The town has benefited from improved road and rail links to Oxford and London, while its economy has diversified: as well as the local services and a military presence, the designer outlet shopping centre of Bicester Village opened in 1995 and has become mysteriously popular with tourists from the Far East.  There are plans for further major expansion of the town, with 14,000 new homes in a garden city-type development; if these come to fruition Bicester could overtake Banbury to become the largest town in Cherwell district.

http://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/cherwell-bicester-w.png

That population growth led to new ward boundaries for Cherwell council which came in in 2016, so it is difficult to compare with the 2011 census.  However, the former Bicester West was the town's most working-class ward; and given that the 2016 boundary changes moved into the ward the town's most deprived census district, that's likely to be even more true now.  The old Bicester West was close between the Tories and Labour in 2002, and the Conservatives lost a seat there in 2003 to Labour candidate Les Sibley.  Sibley has clearly developed a huge personal vote: he was re-elected in 2007, 2011 and 2015 (by which election he had left Labour and gone independent).  In 2016, the only previous result on the present boundaries, Sibley was re-elected at the top of the poll with an enormous 48%, almost 1,000 votes ahead of his nearest rival; the Conservative slate was second with 20% and won the other two seats, with Labour polling 14%.  Jolanta Lis was elected in third place and hence was due for re-election in May.  Les Sibley is also the county councillor for most of the ward; a small part of this ward is included in the Tory-held county division of Bicester North.

This poll will complete the 2018 Cherwell council election.  Defending for the Conservatives is their replacement candidate David Lydiat, an RSPB volunteer who is described by the party as a local community campaigner.  Lydiat's main competition may well come from independent candidate John Broad, who has nominated by Les Sibley; Broad was the Labour candidate for the previous Bicester West ward in 2006 and 2010.  The official Labour candidate is Stuart Moss, whose Twitter biography simply says "left handed".  Completing the ballot paper are Mark Chivers for the Liberal Democrats and a candidate who wasn't on the original list for May's cancelled poll, Robert Nixon of the Green Party.

<h2>Astwell; and<br/>
Whittlewood</h2>

South Northamptonshire council; caused respectively by the resignation of Simon Marinker, who is moving away from the area; and the disqualification of Lizzy Bowen, who failed to attend any council meetings in six months.  Both were Conservative councillors who had served since 2015.

From Oxfordshire we move over the regional boundary into the East Midlands, but not very far.  Both Astwell and Whittlewood wards lie on the Northamptonshire-Buckinghamshire boundary either side of the village of Silverstone.  Astwell is on the west side, covering four parishes between Silverstone and Brackley; Whittlewood is on the east side.  Neither ward is named after its largest parish.  The name Astwell derives from Astwell Castle, a manor house associated with the Earls Temple and the Marquesses of Buckingham, who were active in eighteenth-century British politics.  Whittlewood, on the other hand, takes its name from the mediaeval hunting area of Whittlewood Forest, much of which still exists today; the ward's main centre of population is Potterspury, a village on the A5 Watling Street.

The boundaries of Astwell ward are unchanged since the formation of South Northamptonshire district in 1973.  In the twelve ordinary elections since then the Conservatives have only lost the ward once, to the Liberal Democrats in 1995; and Astwell ward has frequently been left uncontested.  The most recent election in 2015 was contested, the Tories beating Labour 78-22.

Whittlewood ward was formed in 1999 and has unchanged boundaries since then.  It was held by Labour at its formation, but Labour lost the ward to the Tories in 2007 by the score of 73-27.  Nobody has bothered to challenge the Conservatives here since.  

At county level both wards are in safe Conservative divisions: Astwell is covered by the county councillor for Silverstone, while Whittlewood is part of Deanshanger division.

Defending Astwell for the Conservatives is Paul Wiltshire, a Brackley town councillor.  He is opposed by Labour candidate Richard Solesbury-Timms, a train driver who came third in his home Middleton Cheney ward at a by-election two months ago.  Neither candidate lives in the ward.

Another candidate associated with the rail industry is William Barter, defending Tory candidate for Whittlewood ward; Barter worked for British Rail for seventeen years and is now an independent rail planning consultant.  He is opposed by Potterspury resident Abigail Medina of the Lib Dems and by Labour's Adrian Scandrett.
