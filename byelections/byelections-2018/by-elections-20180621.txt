<h2>Alcombe</h2>

West Somerset council; caused by the resignation of UKIP councillor Adrian Behan who had served since 2015.

I'll start this week in the south-west of England by saying farewell.  This will almost certainly be the last by-election held to West Somerset district council, which is being abolished in May 2019: it will merge with the neighbouring Taunton Deane district to form a new district council with the appalling name of "Somerset West and Taunton".  Most likely it was West Somerset council which drove this merger: with a population under 35,000 it is the smallest second-tier local government district in England.  Until last month there were some electoral <em>wards</em> in Birmingham with that sort of headcount, and 35,000 souls in a rugged area of the country is not really enough of a base to support the sort of services which local government is expected to provide these days.  Several tiny district councils in Dorset are going in 2019 as well; as Rutland has unitary status, Melton borough in Leicestershire will take over next year as the smallest shire district by population.

Alcombe is the south-eastern of the four wards covering Minehead, West Somerset's largest population centre, and is effectively a village which has been swallowed up by the town.  The name Minehead is cognate with the Welsh word for mountain, <em>mynydd</em>, nicely describing its location at the foot of Exmoor; indeed parts of Alcombe ward lie within the Exmoor National Park.  With Minehead being dependent on tourism for its economy - Butlins is still a major employer - jobs here are not well-paid, and Alcombe ward's census return has high scores in the working-class occupation groups.

Not that you'd guess that from Alcombe's election results, which are fragmented.  The ward elects two West Somerset councillors, but since it was created in 2011 none of the parties have stood more than one candidate here.  In 2011 the poll was topped by Ian Melhuish, outgoing independent councillor for the predecessor ward of Alcombe East, with the Tories winning the other seat.  Melhuish lost his seat to UKIP in 2015: shares of the vote were 26% for the Conservatives, 22% for UKIP, 19% for Labour, 18% for Melhuish and 14% for the Green Party.  At county council level this is part of the Dunster division which is safely Conservative; and next year it will form part of the Dunster ward to elect three Somerset West and Taunton district councillors.

With no defending UKIP candidate we have a free-for-all.  The Conservatives have selected Minehead town councillor Andy Parbrook, who is hoping to join on the district council his wife Jean.  Another Andrew on the ballot paper is Labour's Andrew Mountford, who runs a B&B in the town.  Stephenie Stephens is standing as an independent candidate, and with the Greens not returning Nicole Hawkins of the Liberal Democrats completes the ballot paper.

<h2>Kempshott</h2>

Basingstoke and Deane council, Hampshire; caused by the disqualification of Conservative councillor Anne Court, who failed to attend any meetings in six months.

http://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/basingstoke-deane-kempshott.png

We've been here before, haven't we?  Yes, this is the second Kempshott by-election in four months as we make a return visit to the western edge of Basingstoke.  This is an area which was developed for housing in the 1970s and early 1980s as the town of Basingstoke greatly expanded thanks to London overspill.  Previously this area had been part of Kempshott Park, an estate held from 1789 by the future George IV who spent his honeymoon with Caroline of Brunswick here.  A bit of a stepdown from Alberta where the Sussexes reportedly honeymooned, but fashions were different in the eighteenth century.  George and Caroline's Kempshott House is no more - it was demolished to make way for the M3 motorway - but the modern Kempshott houses are very much here and very much owner-occupied - 91% of the ward's households have that tenure, putting Kempshott in the top 100 wards in England and Wales.

This is a safe Tory ward where the party is not seriously challenged.  It's the third time in four months that Kempshott voters have been called to the polls, so there may be an element of voter fatigue; however, the March poll, despite being on the first day of spring, was on a day of heavy snow which clearly affected turnout.  Snow is unlikely to be a factor in mid-June.  The Tory lead here was 59-31 over Labour in the March by-election, rising to 67-21 in the May ordinary election.

The ballot paper has an unusual feature: Anne Court is standing for re-election in the by-election caused by her own disqualification.  She had been a Basingstoke councillor since 1995, and was Mayor of Basingstoke and Deane in 2015-16.  Late last year Court had a routine knee operation which led to severe post-operative complications: a second operation and a prolonged recovery period saved her leg from being amputated, but it was a close-run thing and that prolonged recovery period meant that she fell foul of the six-month non-attendance rule.  This column has seen a few examples of councillors standing for re-election in such circumstances, and they do usually get back in; with the Tory lead here and Court's long previous service for the ward this is likely to be another such case.  Hoping that won't happen is Labour candidate Grant Donohoe, a teacher who stood in March's by-election and is hoping to go from second to first this time round.  Completing the Kempshott ballot paper, as she did in March's by-election and May's ordinary election, is the Lib Dems' Stavroulla O'Doherty.
