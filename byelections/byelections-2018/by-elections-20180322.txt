In the last big week of by-elections before the ordinary May elections, there are eight polls on 22nd March 2018.

<h2>Penicuik</h2>

Midlothian council; caused by the death of the Provost of Midlothian, Labour councillor Adam Montgomery, at the age of 67.  From a mining family - his grandfather worked down the pits for 58 years, while his father was an NUM safety inspector who investigated more than 150 fatal mining accidents - Montgomery started his career with the National Coal Board and later worked for Edinburgh council as a housing officer and NALGO shop steward.  That gave Montgomery a leg up into politics, and in 1986 he gained the Penicuik seat on the Lothian regional council.  Transferring to Midlothian council in the 1990s reorganisation, Montgomery was leader of the council from 2003 to 2007; more recently he had been working on a study to reopen the rail link to Penicuik.

We start this week with our only Scottish by-election.  We're on the eastern slopes of the Pentland Hills here to visit a town named after the Hill of the Cuckoo, <em>Peighinn na Cuthaig</em> in Gaelic, and consequently pronounced "Pennycook".  On the A701 road halfway between Edinburgh and Peebles, Penicuik started off in 1770 as a planned village to house workers at Cowan's paper mills, and was modelled on the Edinburgh New Town but much less architecturally distinguished.  The town's population boomed in the 1810s thanks to French prisoners captured in the Peninsular War, and in the cold winter of January 1847 the first Grand Match in curling took place here with the north of Scotland taking on the south.  The paper mills have gone now, but commuting to Edinburgh and the Royal Highland Fusiliers, 2nd Battn Royal Regt of Scotland, whose garrison is in Penicuik, provide major contributions to the town's economy.

In the 2003 election to Midlothian council, the last held under first-past-the-post, the Liberal Democrats dominated Penicuik: they won Penicuik North and Penicuik South East wards and were only 20 votes behind Labour in Penicuik South West.  However, the present ward has been carried by the SNP at each poll since PR was introduced in 2007.  In 2007 Penicuik's three seats went one each to the SNP, the Lib Dems and Labour; the Nationalists gained the Lib Dem seat in 2012 but lost their second seat to the Conservatives in 2017.  Shares of the vote in 2017 were 35% for the SNP and 26% each for the Conservatives and Labour.  However, the Nationalists lost the Midlothian constituency in the general election a few weeks later, a gain which will give Labour confidence that they can hold this seat despite starting from third place.

Both Labour and the SNP are appealing to Scottish patriotism by selecting candidates called Wallace.  The defending Labour candidate Vivienne Wallace has had the big guns out in support of her, with Jeremy Corbyn and Labour's Scottish leader Richard Leonard both in town last week and Baroness Chakrabarti turning up in the snow last weekend.  The SNP candidate is Joe Wallace, a retired electrician and Montgomery's predecessor as Provost of Midlothian; he was councillor for this ward from 2012 to 2017 but lost his seat to the Conservatives last year.  Standing for the Conservaives is Murdo Macdonald, who was recently retired from a career in the defence industry.  Completing the ballot paper is Scottish Green candidate Helen Armstrong.

<h2>Bunbury</h2>

Cheshire East council; caused by the disqualification of Conservative councillor Michael Jones, who failed to attend any meetings of the council in six months.  He had served since 2011.

We move to England, where the seven by-elections today fall into two trios - one trio in the Home Counties and a second in the debateable lands between the Midlands and the North - with an odd one out which we shall come to at the end.  Starting with the North or Midlands trio we are in Cheshire, in a rural ward of fourteen parishes covering the rolling countryside between Crewe and Nantwich to the south-east and Tarporley to the north-west.  The largest of those parishes, with 1,121 electors, is Bunbury.  A name which might be better known as a city in Western Australia, a supergroup with Eric Clapton and the Bee Gees or an unseen character in <em>The Importance of Being Earnest</em>, Bunbury lies off the Shropshire Union Canal which has a staircase of locks here.  At the southern end of the ward is Dorfold Hall near Nantwich, described by Pevsner as one of the finest Jacobean houses in Cheshire.  Bunbury ward makes the top 100 wards in England and Wales for 16- and 17-year-olds, although there doesn't appear to be an obvious reason why this should be.  (Perhaps someone can enlighten me in the comments?)

This is an area which is politically true blue.  Created on its current boundaries in 2011, Bunbury re-elected Michael Jones with a 70-18 margin over Labour in 2015.  That was despite the fact that Jones had been council leader since 2012 and his administration had presided over a string of well-publicised controversies, from the council spending public money on a stall at a local Conservative Party conference to Jones announcing that plans for a Macclesfield supermarket would be refused before the planning committee had even considered the application.

Jones resigned as council leader in December 2015 after it was revealed that his council had repeatedly waived its own rules to award contracts to a company run by Jones' personal physiotherapist, a move which sparked a police investigation.  He resigned from the council's Conservative group and repeatedly announced that he was going to resign from the council once the police investigation was over.  In fact, Jones never submitted his resignation letter to the Cheshire East chief executive; this by-election has instead come about under the six-month non-attendance rule.  Controversial to the last.

The Cheshire East Tories will no doubt be hoping that with Jones off the scene they can finally put these embarassing episodes behind them.  Their defending candidate is Chris Green, a public speaking coach, Bunbury parish councillor and office-holder in the Eddisbury branch of the Conservative party.  The Labour candidate is Jake Lomax, who works in financial services specialising in communications and transaction monitoring.  Also standing are Mark Sharkey for the Green Party - who fought this ward in 2015 - and Liberal Democrat Mark Jones.  Some of the electors for this by-election may be pleased to note that their polling station is a pub - the Tollemache Arms in Alpraham.

<h2>Leek West</h2>

Staffordshire Moorlands council; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Robert Plant who had served since 2007.

We move eastwards and upwards to Leek, the main town in the Staffordshire Moorlands district but not typical of Staffordshire as a whole.  Leek is an upland town on the edge of the Peak District, and economically it was the southernmost of the Pennine textile towns, specialising in silkworking like the towns nearest to it in Cheshire.  In more recent years the largest local employer was the Britannia building society which was based in Leek until merging with the Co-op in 2009.  Many of the building society workers will have lived in Leek West ward, covering the Westwood area and the newest and least-deprived part of town; much of the ward's housing dates from the 1970s.

Leek is a politically interesting town which can vote for pretty much any party under the right conditions.  Unfortunately for present purposes Leek West is one of its more boring wards: it voted Liberal Democrat in 2003 but the Conservatives gained two of the ward's seats in 2007 and the other one in 2015.  That was quite a comfortable win: shares of the vote in 2015 were 35% for the Conservatives, 21% for Labour, 15% for the localist Moorlands Democratic Alliance slate and 12% for the Greens.  At county level this is part of the Leek South division, which voted UKIP in 2009 and Conservative in a 2012 by-election but has been held by Labour since 2013: Charlotte Atkins, the former Staffordshire Moorlands MP, was re-elected in 2017 with an increased majority.

The Conservatives have taken no chances in securing the prized spot at the top of the ballot paper: their defending candidate is James Abberley who is the only candidate not to give an address in Leek (he lies in Kingsley on the Stoke-Ashbourne road).  The Labour candidate is Bill Cawley, who fought Leek East ward on their ticket in 2015; he was a Stoke-on-Trent councillor from 1982 to 1990 (Lab, Hartshill ward), and contested some Leek elections earlier in this decade as a Green Party or independent figure.  There is no Moorlands Democratic Alliance or official Green candidate this time, so completing the ballot paper are Liberal Democrat candidate George Herbert and Leek town councillor Stephen Wales, standing as an independent.

<h2>Worksop South-East</h2>

Bassetlaw council, Nottinghamshire; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Deirdre Foley.

We are in the last of our polls in the debatable lands here, but this is a very different area to rural Cheshire and suburban Leek.  Worksop South-East ward is based on Manton, a pit village which has now been swallowed up by the growth of Worksop but was originally built in the 1900s to serve Manton Colliery.  One of the most productive pits in the UK - over a million tonnes of coal were extracted in the year 1979 - Manton was the location of the some of the ugliest scenes in the 1984 miners' strike, with Manton miner Bob Taylor successfully bringing a court action to have the strike declared unlawful.  

The closure of the colliery in 1994 brought all the usual problems, but the pit site has been redeveloped as a business park which has insulated the ward from economic collapse.  Part of that business park is a Greencore food factory which claims to be the largest sandwich factory in the world.  In the 2011 census Worksop South-East came in at number 12 in England and Wales for routine occupations and just outside the top 100 for semi-routine occupations: those two workng-class categories account for almost 50% of the workforce, while the ward is also in the top 30 in England and Wales for adults with no qualifications (45%).  It should not come as a surprise to learn that the ward includes some of Nottinghamshire's most deprived census districts.

It should also not come as a surprise to learn that this is a very safe Labour ward.  At the party's recent high point in 2012 they polled over 87% in a straight fight with the Conservatives; in the most recent district election in 2015 Labour beat UKIP here 56-25.  In May last year the ward was split between two county divisions which were both safe Labour.  The good Tory performance in the Bassetlaw constituency in the 2017 general election clearly didn't come out of this ward.

Defending for Labour is the wonderfully-named Clayton Tindle, who works for Wilko and is a GMB rep.  With UKIP not returning, Tindle is up against Lib Dem Leon Duveen (who fought the Bassetlaw constituency last year) and Conservative Lewis Stanniland.

<h2>Central and Walton</h2>

Aylesbury Vale council, Buckinghamshire; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Edward Sims.

As we move to our second English trio in the home counties, it's time for a new nomination in the occasional Andrew's Previews awards for the UK's Most Appalling Council Website.  Bolton electoral series were the last to feel your columnist's wrath by completely failing to publish the notices for the recent Farnworth by-election online.  Everybody else is doing it Bolton, look to the world beyond the Chequerbent Roundabout and start doing the same.  It takes a lot to top that level of incompetence; however, I have the dubious pleasure of announing that Bolton has been trumped by Aylesbury Vale district council.  Aylesbury Vale put the notices for the Central and Walton by-election online, but made them inaccessible to anybody who hasn't registered for an online account with the council, and your columnist spent a very painful hour trying to register before eventually giving up.  That's an hour of my life I'm not going to get back.  Restricting access to democracy like that is simply not good enough and there's a good reason that nobody else does it.  So congratulations Aylesbury Vale on achieving the sought-after prize of UK's Most Appalling Council Website.  Please get in contact that so that I can post your certificate to you.

A bad way to have to start a preview covering one of the most notoriously awful towns in the South of England.  Aylesbury is a rather isolated place in the north-western shadow of the Chiltern hills which has ended up as the county town of Buckinghamshire thanks to its relatively central location within the county.  As the name suggests, this is the town centre ward: here can be found the central business district together with the railway station and the famously ugly Buckinghamshire county council offices.  The old Aylesbury Central ward made the top 100 in England and Wales for full-time employment.  Boundary changes for the 2015 election added an extra councillor and the Walton area to the south-east, an area dominated by large schools: Aylesbury Grammar, Aylesbury High and The Grange.

The old Aylesbury Central ward was Lib Dem until 2011 when the Conservatives gained it.  Walton had previously been part of Bedgrove ward which had a similar political trajectory.  In the 2015 election the new Central and Walton elected the Conservative slate on a low share of the vote: 33%, to 23% for the Lib Dems, 19% for Labour and 17% for UKIP.  In May's county elections the old Central ward was in Aylesbury North division which was safe Lib Dem, while Walton was in Aylesbury South-East division which was safe Tory.

Defending for the Conservatives is Lou Redding, a chartered engineer and visiting research fellow at Cranfield University.  The Lib Dem candidate is taxi firm operator Waheed Raja, who won a by-election to Aylesbury town council last year and is hoping to double up at town and district level.  Labour have selected Philip Jacques, chairman of the party's Aylesbury branch.  UKIP have not returned, so the ballot paper is completed by Green candidate Matt Williams and independent Kyle Michael, a businessman and former pub landlord who contested Aylesbury in the last general election: he came sixth out of six candidates with 1.1%.
