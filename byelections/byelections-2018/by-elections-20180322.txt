<h2>Penicuik</h2>

Midlothian council; caused by the death of the Provost of Midlothian, Labour councillor Adam Montgomery, at the age of 67.  From a mining family - his grandfather worked down the pits for 58 years, while his father was an NUM safety inspector who investigated more than 150 fatal mining accidents - Montgomery started his career with the National Coal Board and later worked for Edinburgh council as a housing officer and NALGO shop steward.  That gave Montgomery a leg up into politics, and in 1986 he gained the Penicuik seat on the Lothian regional council.  Transferring to Midlothian council in the 1990s reorganisation, Montgomery was leader of the council from 2003 to 2007; more recently he had been working on a study to reopen the rail link to Penicuik.

We start this week with our only Scottish by-election.  We're on the eastern slopes of the Pentland Hills here to visit a town named after the Hill of the Cuckoo, <em>Peighinn na Cuthaig</em> in Gaelic, and consequently pronounced "Pennycook".  On the A701 road halfway between Edinburgh and Peebles, Penicuik started off in 1770 as a planned village to house workers at Cowan's paper mills, and was modelled on the Edinburgh New Town but much less architecturally distinguished.  The town's population boomed in the 1810s thanks to French prisoners captured in the Peninsular War, and in the cold winter of January 1847 the first Grand Match in curling took place here with the north of Scotland taking on the south.  The paper mills have gone now, but commuting to Edinburgh and the Royal Highland Fusiliers, 2nd Battn Royal Regt of Scotland, whose garrison is in Penicuik, provide major contributions to the town's economy.

In the 2003 election to Midlothian council, the last held under first-past-the-post, the Liberal Democrats dominated Penicuik: they won Penicuik North and Penicuik South East wards and were only 20 votes behind Labour in Penicuik South West.  However, the present ward has been carried by the SNP at each poll since PR was introduced in 2007.  In 2007 Penicuik's three seats went one each to the SNP, the Lib Dems and Labour; the Nationalists gained the Lib Dem seat in 2012 but lost their second seat to the Conservatives in 2017.  Shares of the vote in 2017 were 35% for the SNP and 26% each for the Conservatives and Labour.  However, the Nationalists lost the Midlothian constituency in the general election a few weeks later, a gain which will give Labour confidence that they can hold this seat despite starting from third place.

Both Labour and the SNP are appealing to Scottish patriotism by selecting candidates called Wallace.  The defending Labour candidate Vivienne Wallace has had the big guns out in support of her, with Jeremy Corbyn and Labour's Scottish leader Richard Leonard both in town last week and Baroness Chakrabarti turning up in the snow last weekend.  The SNP candidate is Joe Wallace, a retired electrician and Montgomery's predecessor as Provost of Midlothian; he was councillor for this ward from 2012 to 2017 but lost his seat to the Conservatives last year.  Standing for the Conservaives is Murdo Macdonald, who was recently retired from a career in the defence industry.  Completing the ballot paper is Scottish Green candidate Helen Armstrong.

<h2>Bunbury</h2>

Cheshire East council; caused by the disqualification of Conservative councillor Michael Jones, who failed to attend any meetings of the council in six months.

We move to England, where the seven by-elections today fall into two trios - one trio in the Home Counties and a second in the debateable lands between the Midlands and the North - with an odd one out which we shall come to at the end.  Starting with the North or Midlands trio we are in Cheshire, in a rural ward of fourteen parishes covering the rolling countryside between Crewe and Nantwich to the south-east and Tarporley to the north-west.  The largest of those parishes, with 1,121 electors, is Bunbury.  A name which might be better known as a city in Western Australia, a supergroup with Eric Clapton and the Bee Gees or an unseen character in <em>The Importance of Being Earnest</em>, Bunbury lies off the Shropshire Union Canal which has a staircase of locks here.

This is an area which is politically true blue.  Created on its current boundaries in 2011, Bunbury re-elected Michael Jones with a 70-18 margin over Labour in 2015.  That was despite the fact that Jones had been council leader since 2012 and his administration had presided over a string of well-publicised controversies, from the council spending public money on a stall at a local Conservative Party conference to Jones announcing that plans for a Macclesfield supermarket would be refused before the planning committee had even considered the application.

Jones resigned as council leader in December 2015 after it was revealed that his council had repeatedly waived its own rules to award contracts to a company run by Jones' personal physiotherapist, a move which sparked a police investigation.  He resigned from the council's Conservative group and repeatedly announced that he was going to resign from the council once the police investigation was over.  In fact, Jones never submitted his resignation letter to the Cheshire East chief executive; this by-election has instead come about under the six-month non-attendance rule.  Controversial to the last.

The Cheshire East Tories will no doubt be hoping that with Jones off the scene they can finally put these embarassing episodes behind them.  Their defending candidate is Chris Green, a public speaking coach, Bunbury parish councillor and office-holder in the Eddisbury branch of the Conservative party.  The Labour candidate is Jake Lomax, who works in financial services specialising in communications and transaction monitoring.  Also standing are Mark Sharkey for the Green Party - who fought this ward in 2015 - and Liberal Democrat Mark Jones.  Some of the electors for this by-election may be pleased to note that their polling station is a pub - the Tollemache Arms in Alpraham.

<h2>Leek West</h2>

Staffordshire Moorlands council; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Robert Plant who had served since 2007.

We move eastwards and upwards to Leek, the main town in the Staffordshire Moorlands district but not typical of Staffordshire as a whole.  Leek is an upland town on the edge of the Peak District, and economically it was the southernmost of the Pennine textile towns, specialising in silkworking like the towns nearest to it in Cheshire.  In more recent years the largest local employer was the Britannia building society which was based in Leek until merging with the Co-op in 2009.  Many of the building society workers will have lived in Leek West ward, covering the Westwood area and the newest and least-deprived part of town; much of the ward's housing dates from the 1970s.

Leek is a politically interesting town which can vote for pretty much any party under the right conditions.  Unfortunately for present purposes Leek West is one of its more boring wards: it voted Liberal Democrat in 2003 but the Conservatives gained two of the ward's seats in 2007 and the other one in 2015.  That was quite a comfortable win: shares of the vote in 2015 were 35% for the Conservatives, 21% for Labour, 15% for the localist Moorlands Democratic Alliance slate and 12% for the Greens.  At county level this is part of the Leek South division, which voted UKIP in 2009 and Conservative in a 2012 by-election but has been held by Labour since 2013: Charlotte Atkins, the former Staffordshire Moorlands MP, was re-elected in 2017 with an increased majority.

The Conservatives have taken no chances in securing the prized spot at the top of the ballot paper: their defending candidate is James Abberley who is the only candidate not to give an address in Leek (he lies in Kingsley on the Stoke-Ashbourne road).  The Labour candidate is Bill Cawley, who fought Leek East ward on their ticket in 2015 and was previously a Green Party figure.  There is no Moorlands Democratic Alliance or official Green candidate this time, so completing the ballot paper are Liberal Democrat candidate George Herbert and Leek town councillor Stephen Wales, standing as an independent.
