Four by-elections on 11th January 2018, which fall neatly into two pairs:

<hr/>

<h2>Birchington and Rural</h2>

Kent county council; and

<h2>Thanet Villages</h2>

Thanet council, Kent; both caused by the death of Conservative councillor Ken Gregory.  Gregory had worked at Thanet council for more than twenty years, and after his retirement entered the Thanet council chamber in 2007.  He had represented a variety of wards during his councillor career: St Peter's ward 2007-11, Garlinge ward 2011-15, Thanet Villages ward since 2015.  In May 2017 Gregory was elected to Kent county council, in which he was in his first term.

Welcome to the Isle of Thanet, an area which has seen much political focus over the last few years.  Our two Thanet by-elections today are concentrated in the west of the Isle and in Thanet's only rural ward.

Birchington and Rural is a two-seat division of Kent county council which essentially covers the area west of Margate and Ramsgate.  The main centres of population are Birchington and Westgate-on-Sea, small resorts on the north coast: Birchington in particular is a retirement centre, with Birchington North ward being in the top 40 in England and Wales for over-64s and retirement.  Two wards in western Margate (Garlinge and Westbrook) are also included in the division, while the odd one out is Thanet Villages which covers six parishes in the undeveloped part of Thanet.

Undeveloped now, but maybe not for long.  For some years now the major hot political potato in Thanet has been the fate of Manston Airport, which is located within Thanet Villages ward.  Opened in the winter of 1915-16 by the Royal Flying Corps, Manston has the UK's eleventh-longest and widest runway - wide enough for three planes to land simultaneously - and its location close to the Continent placed it on the front line during the Battle of Britain.  Manston was heavily bombed, and often became the final destination for damaged RAF planes limping home to the UK.  After use by the US Air Force in the early part of the Cold War, Manston from 1960 became a joint civilian and RAF airport with the occasional charter flight.  It was renamed Kent International Airport in 1989, but efforts to attract budget airlines were derailed by the collapse of EUjet - which had bought Manston - in 2005 and the financial crash of 2008.  Manston saw its final scheduled flight on 9 April 2014 - a KLM departure to Amsterdam - and officially closed on 15 May 2014 with the loss of 144 jobs.  Possibly the widest prominence for the airport came in 2001, when it featured as a North Korean airbase in the James Bond film <em>Die Another Day</em>.

So, what to do with the airport site?  This is up to Thanet council as the planning authority.  Thanet's UKIP administration elected in 2015 had a manifesto pledge to reopen the airport to traffic, but nobody has yet come forward with the business plan required for this to work.  The landowners have a plan to turn the airport site into 2,500 homes, business units and parkland, a plan which has not found political approval.  In the meantime some of the site is taken up by two museums - one on the history of the RAF base, the other dedicated to Spitfires and Hurricanes - and the landowners are receiving payments from the Government to keep the site on standby as an emergency lorry park for use in Operation Stack.  With the government's proposals to leave the EU Customs Union having the potential to lead to major intractable problems at the Port of Dover, one suspects that this could end up being the eventual fate of Manston Airport.

We shall see.  For now we must turn to the politics of Birchington and Rural, and Thanet Villages.  Birchington and Rural was created in May this year by merging the two former county divisions of Birchington and Villages, and Margate West.  Both of those divisions were Conservative in 2005 and 2009 but voted UKIP in 2013.  May's results suggest that the UKIP bubble in Thanet has burst and the Conservatives are back in control: the Tories won the new division with 50% of the vote, to 16% each for Labour and UKIP.

Thanet Villages ward is politically more complicated because of a strong independent vote for Minster parish councillor Bob Grove.  Minster-in-Thanet accounts for just over half of the ward's 5,474 electors; it was the location where St Augustine of Canterbury landed in England in AD 597 and its name comes from the fact that this has been a monastic settlement since the seventh century.  Bridge players may note that one of the smaller villages in the ward is called Acol, although the bidding system of that name has no connection to Thanet: it was developed at the Acol bridge club in north-west London.  Bob Grove has recently held all the trump cards in Thanet Villages; he won a by-election in June 2009 and was re-elected at the top of the poll in 2011 and 2015.  The other two seats in the ward were traditionally Conservative, but one of them was lost to UKIP in the 2015 elelection.  That 2015 election was fragmented: Grove (who was not opposed by the Conservative slate) had 27%, the Tories 26%, UKIP 24% and the Greens 12%.

Defending for the Conservatives in Thanet Villages is Reece Pugh.  A House of Commons researcher, he contested the last by-election in Thanet in Margate Central ward last August; that was a win for Labour, but Pugh is on his home turf this time round.  There is an independent candidate, St Nicholas-at-Wade and Sarre parish councillor Sonya Smyth.  Interestingly, given that they run Thanet council only as a minority, there is no UKIP candidate.  Completing the district ballot paper are Green Party candidate Natasha Ransom, who stood here in 2015, Labour's Pauline Farrance and the Lib Dems' Angie Curwen.

Moving up to county level, the defending Conservative candidate is Liz Hurst, a Birchington parish councillor who runs a pet shop.  Several candidates appear on both the district and county ballot papers including Labour's Pauline Farrance, women's officer for the party's North Thanet branch.  The UKIP candidate is Zita Wiltshire, a former Thanet councillor: she served from 2003 to 2015 as a Conservative councillor for St Peters ward in Broadstairs but lost re-election in 2015 under her new purple colours.  Angie Curwen for the Lib Dems and Natasha Ransom for the Greens, both of whom stood here in May's county elections, complete the county ballot paper.
