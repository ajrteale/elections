By-elections on 8th March 2018:

<h2>Farnworth</h2>

Bolton council, Greater Manchester; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Asif Ibrahim due to pressure of work.  He had served since 2012.

<blockquote>
Between Manchester and Bolton, the ugliness is so complete that is almost exhilirating.  It challenges you to live there.
</blockquote>

Challenge accepted.  That was J B Priestley writing in his <em>English Journey</em> of the early 1930s, and laying the foundation for a whole genre of "it's grim up north" travel books which has been extensively mined ever since by a variety of authors.

Your columnist's first reaction to this quote is to think that anybody from the West Riding - as Priestley was - must have necessarily been biased.  There are plenty of beautiful places between Manchester and Bolton.  A quarter of an hour's walk from your columnist's house leads to Nob End, a beauty spot overlooking the Croal and Irwell valleys at the point where they meet.  From the banks of the Manchester, Bolton and Bury canal I can look over the valley towards Farnworth on the other side, and think...

...yes, maybe Priestley had a point.

Of course, it's a post-industrial landscape which I'm looking over now.  When Priestley was writing Nob End wasn't the haven for rare orchids it is now: it was an active chemical waste dump overlooked by a narrowboat repair centre.  Moses Gate country park, of which Nob End is a part, was filled by paper mills and a colliery.  Those industries gave Farnworth a wider economic base than the average Lancashire textile town, but won't have given it any beauty points.  It says a lot for the town that Farnworth's most famous son is Alan Ball, the youngest member of England's World Cup-winning football team and later a long-serving football manager; Farnworth Town Hall has been restored as an office building named after Ball.

Some indication of what Farnworth was like in the 1930s can be gleaned from a surprisingly comprehensive internet archive.  This is courtesy of Mass Observation, which covered the Farnworth parliamentary by-election of January 1938.  The Mass Observation archives have all been digitised and published on their own website, Bolton Worktown (http://www.boltonworktown.co.uk/), from which the above photograph of children outside a polling station is taken.  Kids grew up quick in them days.  Mass Observation were interested in learning how election propaganda could influence people, and newsletters from both the Conservative and Labour candidates are in their archives.  Look at the Conservative newsletter below: yes, election newspapers have been going for over eighty years now, and with some changes to the names and dates you could drop this into any letterbox in the town today and still get the message across.

The polling station the 1938 kids were standing outside is a building on Bentinck Street which still stands today.  You get a good view of it as you queue up to traverse one of the disaster areas of modern Farnworth, the hole at Moses Gate.  Moses was, of course, a Biblical patriarch who led the Israelites out of Egypt by holding back the waters of the Red Sea.  His Gate was breached in August last year by a landslip, which undermined a busy road bridge over the Manchester-Bolton railway line and broke the water main supplying your columnist's house.  The resulting hole closed the main road between Farnworth and Bolton for six months, leading to appalling travel delays, and still hasn't been completely filled in.

In fact, quite a lot of Farnworth is a disaster area.  The town centre is one of the most sorry-looking parades of charity shops it's possible to imagine.  Its condition hasn't noticeably been improved by £325,000 of Section 106 money paid by Tesco, who opened a large store in Farnworth in 2013.  Bolton council are claiming that the money has been spent, although it's difficult for locals to work out what is was spent on.  Perhaps they printed it off as £5 notes and tried to fill the hole at Moses Gate with it?  Who knows.

Just one of many controversies involving Bolton council, whose Labour administration - it's fair to say - is unpopular.  In 2016, the council lost a legal case forcing it to disclose the names of two of its councillors who had been summonsed for council tax arrears.  The Labour administration then got into very serious hot water by using emergency powers to pay a grant of £300,000 to a firm of personal injury lawyers.  The council got the money back, but it was a close-run thing as the firm involved has since been shut down by the regulator.  Those of you who read the preview of January's Hulton ward by-election - a ward with a controversial planning issue to add to all the other controversies - will not be surprised to find that Hulton is the only by-election which Labour have lost to the Conservatives so far this year.  And if you read that preview you'll have drawn the right conclusions from that gain: it's nothing to do with Brexit, very little to do with Jeremy Corbyn, and mostly to do with just how unpopular the Bolton Labour administration is.

As well as these financial and political scandals, it's clear from the most cursory of looks around the town centre that the Greatest Town in the Known Universe is falling behind compared to its rivals in Greater Manchester.  Bolton town centre might have just gained a sparkling new bus station, but clearly not many people are choosing to travel to a town centre that's not worth visiting on buses which they can't afford to pay the fare for.  They're voting with their feet, and the result is that Bolton is a place where charity shops - <em>charity shops</em> - are closing down because they can't make ends meet.

In that context it's not surprising that while Farnworth ward is safe Labour the main opposition to them in recent years has come from that most populist of populist movements, UKIP.  At the most recent Bolton election, in 2016, the Labour lead over the Kippers was 48-36.  Noy UKIP are in a state of general collapse at the moment - as well as their national travails, there was not one UKIP candidate in last week's four council by-elections.  (UKIP running scared of a load of snowflakes, who'd have thowt it?)  So it will be interesting to see how well the Kipppers can do this time or whether some new opposition will come forward.  The Bolton News have been giving some prominence to a new localist party, Farnworth and Kearsley First - and it's surprising in retrospect that nobody has previously tried to form a localist party in Bolton borough given its residents' reputation for insularity.

One thing we can be sure of: getting details of the by-election is going to be difficult.  Bolton council have a reputation among local government watchers for being one of the worst councils in the country when it comes to publishing information on upcoming elections, and somebody really needs to tell Electoral Services that, in this digital age, sticking the relevant notices on a board outside the town hall is not enough.  Everybody else is putting the relevant notices on their website; Bolton, there's nothing to stop you doing the same.  Your columnist eventually resorted to getting hold of the candidate list by going into the town centre - in the snowy weather we had last week - and photographing the noticeboard:

As shown, defending for Labour is Rebecca Minors, partner of former Labour councillor Darren Whitehead whose sudden death caused the Hulton by-election in January.  The UKIP candidate is Dave Harvey, a former soldier.  Also standing are 18-year-old Matthew Littler for the Conservatives, David Figgins for the Green Party, David Walsh for the Lib Dems and Paul Sanders for Farnworth and Kearsley First.  We wait to see if this by-election is close enough to get the loudspeaker car out...
