Seven by-elections on Thursday 8th February 2018:

<hr/>

<h2>Hartside</h2>

Eden council, Cumbria; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Sheila Orchard at the age of 66.  Orchard had served since 2007, and was leader of the Eden Conservative group from 2011 to 2015.

February 2018 is going to be a busy month for Andrew's Previews, with seven polls today, fourteen next week and twelve the week after that.  You need to start somewhere, and the most logical place to start is at the top and work your way down.  In that sense Hartside ward is an excellent place to start: we are in the High Pennines here, and on the ward boundary is the highest point of the Pennines, the 2,930-foot summit of Cross Fell.

If you're looking for a viewpoint, it's hard to do better than Cross Fell.  On a clear day you can look west over the Eden Valley to the Lake District mountains, while to the north there are views over the Solway Firth to the Southern Uplands.  Cross Fell is even a viewpoint for Tuesday's by-election in Alyn and Deeside: on a clear day it is theoretically possible to see the Clwydian Hills, over 110 miles away.

Good luck to anybody who tries to photograph that, for Cross Fell is an inhospitable place particularly at this time of year.  Snow often lies on the north face into May, hill fog is common, and Cross Fell is the location of Britain's only named wind: the Helm Wind, which blows strongly down the south-western slope into Hartside ward.

The name of Hartside ward is rather out-of-date; it refers to Hartside Pass, a summit of 1.904 feet on the A686 Penrith-Alston road, but the Pass was transferred out of the ward in boundary changes in 1999.  Instead in this location east of the Eden can be found two parishes which run from the summit of Cross Fell all way down to the river.  The largest centre of population is Culgaith, a village on the Settle and Carlisle railway line.  With 424 electors Culgaih is tiny, but it has produced a person of note in recent years: Stuart Lancaster, the England rugby head coach from 2011 to 2015, grew up in Culgaith.  The ward's other parish is Ousby, one of the Thankful Villages which lost no men in the First World War.  Ousby parish includes the village of Melmerby on the Penrith-Alston road.

This is definitively the part of England least affected by immigration.  In the 2011 census Hartside came in at number 1 of all the wards in England and Wales for White British ethnicity, with 1267 out of 1273 residents or 99.53%.  (In case you were wondering, the six non-White British people broke down as two White Other, two Asian, one mixed-race and one black.)  Hartside is in the top 15 wards in England and Wales for the 45-64 age bracket and in the top 30 for those born in the UK.

Eden is a council which tends to have lots of unopposed returns, and Hartside has only seen one contested election since it took on its current boundaries in 1999.  That poll was in 2015, when Orchard was re-elected with a 57-43 margin over independent candidate Susan Castle-Clarke.  Orchard had taken over her seat in 2007 upon the retirement of Conservative councillor John Lancaster, a farmer who is Stuart Lancaster's father and still sits on Culgaith parish council.

This by-election is rather important for Eden's Conservative administration, which holds 19 out of 38 seats plus this vacancy; so, if the Tories lose this by-election it will be a case of Paradise Lost as their majority on Eden council will go with it.  And the omens for the Conservatives are not particularly good.  They lost a by-election over the mountains in Alston in 2016, after one of their councillors resigned following an exposé of his business dealings in <em>Private Eye</em>, then failed to get the seat back in a second by-election last year after the winner of the first by-election resigned.  Hartside is included in a county division with Alston, which in 2017 was won by Labour (of all people) who gained it from an independent county councillor.

There will still be an Orchard on the ballot paper in Eden, as the defending Conservative candidate is Sheila's widower Robin Orchard, from Melmerby.  Independent candidate Susan Castle-Clarke returns from the 2015 election; she is an Ousby parish councillor.  Completing the ballot paper is Richard Henry of the Green Party.

<h2>Codsall</h2>

Staffordshire county council; and

<h2>Codsall South</h2>

South Staffordshire council; both caused by the death of Conservative councillor Robert Marshall at the age of 57.  A long-serving councillor, he was first elected to South Staffordshire council in a 1994 by-election and to Staffordshire county council in 1997, serving on the county council's cabinet.  On Staffordshire county council he represented Perton from 1997 to 2009 and Codsall since 2009; on South Staffordshire council he represented Perton Dippons ward from 1994 to 2003 and Codsall South since 2003.

Marshall made the headlines in 2003 after spending £2,300 of his ward allowance on a mobile speed camera for the ward, and then being caught speeding by it.  Away from the council he ran the family firm J H Marshall (Pressings) Ltd in Blakenhall, a sheet metal pressing copmany which has been in operation for 100 years.  In his spare time was a keen squash and chess player who had won the MENSA chess championship.

We move to Staffordshire where there are three council by-elections today.  Two of them are in Codsall, a village just to the north-west of Wolverhampton.  Codsall is on the railway line from Wolverhampton to Shrewsbury, and Codsall and Bilbrook stations both lie within the Codsall South ward and Codsall county division.  This gives Codsall South in particular a commuter demographic and some of the characteristics of a dormitory town.  The main employer in the village is South Staffordshire council, whose offices are here.

South Staffordshre is a very Conservative district which has been the recipient of "white flight" from the West Midlands conurbation over the decades.  This was never part of Enoch Powell's constituency, but a fair number of his voters will have ended up in Codsall.  That's reflected at the ballot box were both this county division and this district ward are safe Tory.  In May's county elections the Conservatives polled 75% in Codsall against Labour and Green opposition.  Codsall South was uncontested at the last district elections in 2015; the last poll here was all the way back in 2011 when the Conservatives led UKIP here 62-23.

Defending both by-elections for the Conservatives is Bob Spencer, vice-chairman of Codsall parish council.  Also on both ballot papers is Labour candidate Kevin McElduff, chairman of governors at Codsall Middle School; he was the Labour parliamentary candidate for South Staffordshire in 2010 and 2015.  There is no UKIP candidate, so the Greens complete both ballot papers: they have nominated Gary Burnett for the county seat and Ian Sadler (who was the Liberal Democrat candidate for South Staffordshire in 1992) for the district by-election.
