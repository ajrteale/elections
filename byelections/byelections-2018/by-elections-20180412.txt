Three by-elections on 12th April 2018, all due to resignations:

<h2>St Olaves</h2>

St Edmundsbury council; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Bob Cockle.  He was first elected in 1995 for the former Fornham ward, transferring to this ward in 2003.  Cockle was Mayor of St Edmundsbury in 2008-09, and also served as the inaugural Mayor of Bury St Edmunds when the parish-level town council was re-established in 2003.

We start the week in Bury St Edmunds, the commercial centre of West Suffolk and a rather historic place.  One of the royal boroughs of Anglo-Saxon times, the town is named after Edmund the Martyr, a ninth-century king of East Anglia who was killed in a Viking invasion.  Edmund's remans were buried here and became a pilgrimate site.  In mediaeval England this was a thriving town with a cloth-making industry, while today the main drivers for the local economy are brewing, sugar and tourism.

None of those apply to St Olaves ward, which is very much the wrong side of the tracks.  This is a council estate ward on the north side of the A14 and railway line, based on the Horward Estate developed in the 1960s by Bury St Edmunds borough council.  The census stats bear out that this is a working-class area: St Olaves is in the top 20 wards in England and Wales for the ONS "semi-routine" employment classification, and in the top 40 for adults with between 1 and 5 GCSE passes or equivalent.

With that sort of pedigree you might expect a safe Labour area, and that was what St Olaves was up until 2011.  In that year the other ward councillor, Mark Ereira, sought re-election for the Green Party: he wasn't far off winning, and split the Labour sufficiently that they lost a seat to independent candidate Paul Hopfensperger.  Hopfensperger was re-elected in 2015 at the top of the poll, with Cockle defending his seat from the Conservatives by just 22 votes; shares of the vote were 38% for Hopfensperger, 32% for the Labour slate and 31% for the Conservatives.  Labour are nowhere in the local county division, Tower, in which 2017 split its two seats between the Conservatives - who gained their seat from Ereira - and independent county councillor David Nettleton, who had a majority of just five votes over Hopfensperger.

So, an interesting ward which is slightly more unpredictable than might be expected.  Defending for Labour is Max Clarke, who is the only candidate to give an address in the ward.  There is an independent candidate, Liam Byrne, an organ donation campaigner who has received two life-saving liver transplants: he stood in the 2017 general election in Bury St Edmunds, coming fifth and last with 1.4%.  Tom Murray is trying again for the Conservatives after his near-miss in 2015; he is a Bury St Edmunds town councillor who is retired from an award-winning career as a newspaper photographer.  Murray won three World Press Photo awards, was head of photography for the Sunday Times Colour Magazine, at 25 became the youngest photographer commissioned by the Royal Family, and shot what proved to be the last official publicity shoot by the Beatles.  Completing the ballot paper is the ward's first Liberal Democrat candidate this century: Helen Korfanty is a solicitor who stood for Suffolk Police and Crime Commissioner in 2016 and for Bury St Edmunds in the 2017 general election.

<h2>Middleton Cheney</h2>

South Northamptonshire council; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Judith Baxter who had served since 2011.

Having had our big city by-election, we turn to two wards based on villages.  Middleton Cheney is a large village at the western end of Northamptonshire, so far west it is within the economic orbit not of Northampton but of Banbury, which is just over the county boundary in Oxfordshire.  It is perhaps best known for being the birthplace of Vice-Admiral Lancelot Holland, commander of HMS Hood when it was sunk by the Bismarck.

The ward named after the village, which also includes the neighbouring parish of Warkworth, has unchanged boundaries since at least 1976.  During the twentieth-century there was a significant Labour vote here, perhaps reflecting the transformation of nearby Banbury by London overspill; Labour and the Conservatives split the ward's two seats at every election from 1976 to 1987.  In 1991 Labour stood down and the ward returned an independent and a Conservative unopposed.  Labour convincingly took both seats in 1995, but lost one to the Conservatives in a by-election on general election day in 2001 and the other to an independent candidate in 2003.

Labour had't been seen in Middleton Cheney since, which has resulted in a lack of contested elections.  The independent and Conservative councillors were re-elected unopposed in 2007; in 2011 the independent councillor retired and his seat was gained by the Conservatives, again unopposed.  One of the Conservative councillors sought re-election in 2015 as an independent, giving a contested election which he lost 64-36.  At Northamptonshire county level the Middleton Cheney division, which covers a larger area, is safely Conservative although UKIP were close behind in 2013.

This by-election sees party politics re-emerge in Middleton Cheney.  The defending Conservatives have gone for youth in selecting Jonathan Riley, who is the only candidate not to give an address in the ward (he lives in Brackley).
