One by-election on Tuesday 9th October 2018:

<br/>

<h2>Castle Baynard</h2>

City of London Corporation; caused by the election of Common Councilman Emma Edhem to the Court of Alderman.

For a rare Tuesday by-election we come to the western end of the ancient City of London.  In medieval times London ended at the River Fleet, a tributary of the Thames which has now completely disappeared into London's sewer network.  However, the Fleet formed a natural first line of defence which was supplemented by London's Roman walls and, from the Norman conquest onwards, Baynard's Castle.

<img src="http://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/city-castle-baynard.png" />

The name refers to Ralph Baynard, who came over with the Conqueror and became Sheriff of Essex.  He built a castle on the corner of the Fleet and Thames, next to what became (after Edward III moved his store of arms, personal items and clothing nearby) the church of St Andrew-by-the-Wardrobe.  Baynard's Castle was destroyed in the wars that marked the reign of King John, and a new castle was then built very close by on land which had been reclaimed from the river; this ended up in the hands of the Dukes of York, and became royal property when the Lancastrian king Henry VI was deposed.  Richard III was proclaimed king here after having his nephew Edward V declared illegitimate; Henry VIII gave the castle to his first wife Catherine of Aragon as a wedding present; while the Privy Council met here in 1553 to proclaim their daughter Mary as Queen and end the ill-fated reign of Lady Jane Grey.

The Great Fire of London destroyed Baynard's Castle, and all remains of the mediaeval building had gone by the twentieth century.  Its site was extensively redeveloped in the 1970s and is now occupied by the brutalist Baynard House, an office block occupied by BT.  If you watched <em>Mission: Impossible - Fallout</em> when it came out earlier this year, you've probably seen Baynard House: Tom Cruise broke his ankle jumping off the roof of the building while shooting a scene for that film.

Of course, it's not just BT who are important players within the Castle Baynard ward.  On the riverbank are the railway and Underground stations at Blackfriars, which bring thousands of people into the area every weekday.  To the north-east, St Paul's Cathedral lies within the ward boundary; while to the north-west the ward covers another of Wren's churches, the wedding-cake of St Bride's, together with the area around Fleet Street.  This was traditionally the home of London journalism, but the press have been priced out over the years - the last Fleet Street newspaper office, for the <em>Sunday Post</em>, closed in 2016 - and it's now sandwich shops and financial institutions that rule the roost here.  Boundary changes in this decade have expanded the ward into the Farringdon area, traditionally a district dominated by lawyers.

Under the City of London's unique system of business voting, it's electors nominated by businesses and sole traders within the ward who will elect the winner of this by-election - there are very few people who actually live here.  The Corporation of London has non-partisan politics rather like a largish parish council; despite Labour having won a few seats on the Court of Common Council in recent years, political parties are generally not important in the City's elections.  So this by-election will provide a breath of fresh air from the polarised politics of the modern day - although, as we shall see, there are some party political figures here despite the "Independent" ballot paper description.

The business voters here certainly can't complain that they don't have choice: there are eight candidates for this by-election, which is the longest ballot paper in an English local by-election for a single vacancy since February 2017 (when eight candidates stood for Dinnington ward in Rotherham).  Many of these names will be familiar to City watchers.  Timothy Becker may be at the top of the ballot paper but he has made a habit of finishing at the bottom of City local by-election results: he was last in Bishopsgate ward last November and in Billingsgate ward in March this year, on the latter occasion polling just six votes.  Merlene Emerson may be on the ballot paper as an independent, as is traditional in the City, but she is a prominent Liberal Democrat: of Chinese extraction, Emerson is a City solicitor turned mediator who fought Hammersmith in the 2010 general election, and she was appointed MBE in the 2016 Birthday Honours for political and public service.  Richard Humphreys, who commutes into the city from rural Northamptonshire, is a QC specialising in public law.  Two candidates give addresses in the City of London, on the Barbican estate: barrister Natasha Lloyd-Owen is an official Labour Party candidate, while Deborah Oliver works in corporate relations and communications and was recently appointed to the City of London Police Committee.  They sandwich on the ballot paper Julian Malins, the younger brother of the former Tory MP Humfrey Malins; Malins junior was the Conservative candidate for Pontefract and Castleford in the 1987 general election and is a barrister and Crown Court recorder who has represented Elton John and Lord Archer in libel cases, and more recently conducted an investigation into Cambridge Analytica just before it went bust.  Malins is trying to get back onto the Common Council after losing his seat in Farrington Without ward in last year's City elections.  Those elections also saw Alpa Raja missing out in Castle Baynard after coming ninth out of nine candidates, with the top eight winning; Raja is back for another go.  Completing the ballot paper is another former Common Councilman who lost her seat in 2017, Virginia Rounding who is an author, literary critic and Clerk to the Worshipful Company of Builders' Merchants.  Good luck choosing a winner out of that field.

Five by-elections on 11th October 2018:

<hr/>

<h2>Southlands</h2>

Adur council, West Sussex; caused by the resignation of Paul Graysmark, the leader of the UKIP group on the council, who was first elected in 2000 and had continuous sevice since a May 2013 by-election.  He is retiring and moving to Scotland.

<blockquote>
"A fine and cultivated city containing buildings and flourishing activity"
</blockquote>

That was the Arab Muslim geographer Muhammad al-Idrisi, writing in the middle of the twelfth century; and I'm not going to contradict his assessment of Shoreham-by-Sea.  Mind, in the intervening years Shoreham has been overtaken in importance by the neighbouring towns of Brighton, Hove and Worthing.  Worthing has escaped the normal despressed fate of seaside resorts by diversifying into financial services; Hove is, well, Hove; and despite the vagaries of Thameslink Brighton has become a favoured location for London commuters.  In some ways Brighton is becoming a victim of its own success in that regard, as the cost of living there is now almost as prohibitive as in the Great Wen itself.  Supply and demand being what it is, that means that those people who want to live on the south coast and commute to London are having to look to places which are not Brighton.

Places like Shoreham, which has swung a mile to the left politically within the last electoral cycle: between the 2015 and 2017 general elections the Labour share in the East Worthing and Shoreham constituency doubled from 20% to 40%, turning the seat into a Tory-Labour marginal for the first time.  That wasn't achieved by taking votes off the Conservative MP Tim Loughton, whose share was unchanged at 49%; instead the main loswers were UKIP, who fell from 17% of the vote in 2015 to just 3% two years later.

Clearly something very interesting is going on in this corner of the world, but then again if you look at Southlands ward on its own it might appear as if little has changed on the surface.  The ward is a tract of eastern Shoreham around Southlands Hospital; much of it is ex-council housing from the postwar period and its demographic profile is rather more working-class than neighbouring wards.  Southland is, and has been for several electoral cycles now, a knife-edge marginal.  In the 2004 election, the first on the current boundaries, it split its two seats between the Conservatives and Labour; on the Tory side, that meant that Paul Graysmark lost his seat to his wife Laura.  Awkward.  The Tories convincingly gained the Labour seat in 2006 and things then looked set fair for them, until Paul Graysmark made a political comeback.  Mr Graysmark was elected in 2012 for the Conservatives against a strong Labour resurgence, with a majority of just eight votes; but then he decided to gamble by defecting to UKIP and resigning to seek re-election in his new colours.  The gamble paid off: Graysmark easily held the by-election in May 2013, and got a running-mate elected the following year.

But things then started to get difficult for UKIP in Southlands.  Graysmark was re-elected in 2016, but only just on an almost perfect three-way split: he finished twelve votes ahead of the Conservatives and twenty votes above Labour.  UKIP then collapsed here in the 2017 West Sussex county elections, in which Shoreham North was a very safe Tory division.  That collapse fed through to the 2017 general election the following month and to the May 2018 Adur district elections, in which UKIP resoundingly lost Southlands by finishing last with just 5%.  But it wasn't the Tories who picked up - it was Labour, winning a seat in Southlands for the first time in fourteen years with 42% to the Tories' 41%, a majority of eleven votes.  That was one of four Labour gains in this district in MAy, as the party became the official opposition on Adur council.

So Paul Graysmark has resigned his seat for the second time in five years.  This time he is not seeking re-election; not only that, there is no defending UKIP candidate so we have a free-for-all!  The Labour candidate is Debs Stainforth, who is currently training as a psychologist and, according to Labour's press release, has worked in housing, homelessness and family work for many years.  The Tories' Tony Nicklen returns after his near-misses in 2016 and 2018; he is a technical coordinator in food manufacturing.  Completing the ballot paper is Andrew Bradbury, for the Green Party.

<h2>Ditton</h2>

Halton council, Cheshire; caused by the disqualification of Labour councillor Shaun Osborne, who failed to attend any meetings of the council in six months.

<blockquote>
"if you'd ever seen Widnes, then you'd know why I was keen to get back to London as quickly as possible."
</blockquote>

That was a quote attributed to the singer-songrwriter Paul Simon, and I'm not going to contradict his assessment of Widnes.  Simon had been playing a gig in Widnes and had a long and depressing wait for a train home, during which he started to a write a song which became <em>Homeward Bound</em>, a huge hit for Simon and his then musical partner Art Garfunkel.

https://youtu.be/m0oJ8_VTu3c

A plaque on Widnes railway station commemorates the writing of the song with a slightly worrying lack of irony; but it seems more likely that Simon was actually at Ditton railway station, on the Crewe-Liverpool line, which subsequently closed in 1994 - the first railway station to close after the privatisation of British Rail.  

To the south of the former Ditton station is Halebank, an industrial village on the north bank of the Mersey; while to the north lies part of Widnes proper, the Ditton and Hough Green areas.  Parts of Hough Green are quite well-off, but the political tone of the ward is set by Ditton and Halebank which are strongly Labour.  The Labour party have only lost Ditton ward once in this century, to the Conservatives in 2006 by twenty-nine votes; and that must be put down to a personal vote for the Tory candidate Colin Rowan.  After losing his seat in 2010 Rowan became chairman of Halebank parish council, and he made an attempt to get back onto Halton council as an independent candidate in May's ordinary election: in a straight fight, Labour defeated him by 62-38, which is a relatively low Labour score for the area.

Defending this by-election for the Labour Party is Edward Dourley.  Rowan has not returned, but there will be a contested election as Dourley is opposed by Daniel Clarke for the Conservatives and David Coveney for the Liberal Democrats.
