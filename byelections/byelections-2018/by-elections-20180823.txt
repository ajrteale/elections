Three wise men of Gotham
They went to sea in a bowl
And if the bowl had been stronger
My song would have been longer
</blockquote>

Experience is a dear school, but fools will learn in no other.  There is a meme common to many places in the UK and around the world that the people of the town next door to yours are yokels, idiots, just wrong in some way or another, while none of those considerations apply to <em>your</em> town; it's no coincidence that many of the best-known footballing rivalries involve neighbouring teams.  However, the legends told about the Nottinghamshire village of Gotham take the imbecile meme to another level entirely.  The story as often teld is set in the reign of King John, who was not a good man and had his little ways.  Or, more accurately, big ways; for there was a rule that any road the king travelled on had to be improved and maintained as a public highway.  Now, the king was planning to progress through Gotham on the way to Nottingham, but the people of Gotham didn't want a new road through their village - it's a local village for local people, what's all this shouting, we'll have no trouble here - and they came up with an ingenious solution for getting out of their responsibilities.  According to a nineteenth-century retelling, when King John's advance messengers turned up in Gotham, they
<blockquote>
found some of the inhabitants engaged in endeavouring to drown an eel in a pool of water; some were employed in dragging carts upon a large barn, to shade the wood from the sun; others were tumbling their cheeses down a hill, that they might find their way to Nottingham for sale; and some were employed in hedging in a cuckoo which had perched upon an old bush...
</blockquote>
This was all a bit too hickish even for the itinerant Plantagenet royal court to stomach; and when this intelligence was fed back to the king, surprisingly enough John and his enotourage decided to steer clear of the village.  It was a victory for the Tubbses and Edwards of Gotham, as the new road was never built - and that remains the case to this day, as the main road into Nottingham from the south studiously avoids the place.

This story of the ironically-named "Wise Men of Gotham" has been doing the rounds since at least the fifteenth century.  It was familiar to the nineteenth-century American writer Washington Irving, who in 1807 was writing a magazine satirising the culture and politics of New York City; in the 11th November 1807 edition of <em>Salmagundi</em> Irving rechristened the Big Apple as Gotham.  The appelation stuck, and a century later the comic book writer Milton "Bill" Finger, while fingering through the New York phone book looking for inspiration for a new comic strip, came across a business called "Gotham Jewellers".  Inspiration struck, and a fictional city - going strong in the Marvel Cinematic Universe to this day - was born.  This came at a price: soemwhere along the way from fiction to fiction the village's real-life pronounciation, "Goat-ham", got lost.

For a place as anti-transport development as Gotham has been over the centuries, it's strange that Gotham ward has been the scene for some major transport developments in recent years.  In 2015 Nottingham's tram system was extended into the suburb of Clifton, and beyond it; Clifton South tram stop, a large park-and-ride site which is the terminus of the tram line, lies just outside the Nottingham city limits in the Gotham ward.  At the other end of the ward, near the village of Ratcliffe on Soar, is another park and ride site: East Midlands Parkway railway station, on the main line from London to Derby and Nottingham, which opened in January 2009.  In contrast to the tram East Midlands Parkway has been a bit of a white elephant, failing to reach the projected passenger numbers; its location doesn't help, being simultaneously in the middle of nowhere and in the shadow of the coal-fired Ratcliffe-on-Soar Power Station, which in 2009 was described as one of the largest single sources of carbon dioxide emissions in Europe.

For nearly forty-eight years Gotham has been represented in Parliament by Ken Clarke, the Father of the House of Commons.  A look at the 2015 election result might suggest that Gotham resembles the title of Clarke's memoirs - kind of blue - but that hasn't always been so.  From 1983 to 2015 Gotham ward was represented on Rushcliffe council by Trevor Vennett-Smith, an auctioneer specialising in postcards, ephemera and sporting memorabilia.  Vennett-Smith was elected for the Alliance or the Lib Dems throughout with the exception of his last re-election in 2011, at which he was an independent opposed only by Labour.  In 2015 Vennett-Smith retired to Wales and brought the gavel down on his council career; that left an open seat, which was picked up by the new Conservative candidate Stuart Matthews rather easily: Matthews had 53% of the vote, to 24% for Labour and 23% for UKIP.  The ward is also part of a safe Tory division of Nottinghamshire council council (Leake and Ruddington).

On the face of that recent form your columnist hadn't expected the Gotham by-election to be politically very interesting; but then the candidate list came out and delivered a twist worthy of any DC Comics storyline.  If you're on the Conservative side then no doubt you'll be casting outgoing councillor Stuart Matthews as Two-Face; for Matthews is standing for re-election as an independent candidate.  He is from Ratcliffe on Soar, and was elected to Rushcliffe council in 2015 after selling his former business.  The official Conservative candidate is Rex Walker, of Gotham.  Also from Gotham is the new Labour candidate Lewis McAulay.  UKIP haven't returned but there are two candidates to complete the ballot paper, Jason Billin for the Liberal Democrats and Neil Pinder of the Green Party.

The Riddler himself would have struggled to come up with a more intriguing candidate list.  It's very hard to pick a winner out of this lot: but if you fancy staking a pennyworth or a little more on the outcome, head over to the betting exchange Smarkets...

<h2>Halewood South</h2>

Knowsley council, Merseyside; caused by the death of Labour councillor Tina Harris, who had served since 2010.

Our by-elections this week fall neatly into three pairs, and we now come to our northern pair of by-elections to consider two wards either side of the Mersey estuary.  We start on the north side in the town of Halewood, which is essentially a southern extension of Liverpool which hasn't been incorporated into the city.  The road and railway lines from Runcorn and Widnes enter the Liverpool built-up area here.

Halewood South's housing stock almost all dates from the early 1960s, and there's a reason for that.  Also built in the early 1960s was the Halewood motor plant, opened in October 1963 by the Ford Motor Company; Halewood has been turning out cars and car parts ever since, and for 33 years until 2000 it was the main European production centre for the Ford Escort.  In the 21st century Halewood became a production centre for Jaguar Land Rover; the Jaguar X-Type was made here in the 2000s, while a government grant in March 2010 secured production of the Range Rover Evoque at Halewood.  It was a good investment; the Evoque had good reviews and even better sales figures, prompting JLR to introduce 24-hour running to meet demand.  Of course, it's not just Jaguar Land Rover who provide jobs here: Everton FC's training ground is in the ward, while Halewood railway station on the Liverpool-Warrington-Manchester line provides a fast link from the local houses to Liverpool city centre.

Halewood South was closely fought between Labour and the Liberal Democrats in the 2000s, but since the Coalition was formed the Merseyside area has swung a mile towards Labour with particularly sharp falls in the Lib Dem vote.  Labour gained all three seats in Halewood South between 2010 and 2012; in the 2012 election the defending Lib Dems fell to third place behind the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition, and they haven't been since here sinco.  However, Labour have not had it all their own way since, and the problem for them started in the 2016 election when a boundary review cut the size of Knowsley council from 63 councillors to 45.  Since Labour held all 63 seats at the time, that meant they needed eighteen councillors to retire or be deselected; and one of those deselected was Halewood South councillor Allan Harvey.  Harvey stood for re-election as an independent, finished as runner-up, and in this May's ordinary election was narrowly returned to Knowsley council as an independent candidate: he defeated the official Labour candidate by 47% to 46%, a majority of 41 votes.

That defeated Labour candidate Gary See now has the chance to make a quick comeback; he was a councillor for this ward from 2012 until his defeat in May 2018, at which point he was in the Knowsley council cabinet.  See's toughest opposition may well come from another independent candidate: Bob Swann was a long-serving Labour councillor for the former Halewood West ward, who got deselected when his ward was abolished in 2016.  Also standing are Victoria Smart for the Conservatives and Jenny McNeilis for the Liberal Democrats.
