<h2>Rural West</h2>

Hartlepool council, Co Durham; caused by the resignation of Ray Martin-Wells who was leader of the Conservative group.  He had served since 2010, originally elected as Ray Wells for Park ward before marrying Andrew Martin and transferring to Rural West ward in 2012.  In his resignation announcement Martin-Wells indicated that he was about to become a grandfather and was looking to spend more time with his growing family.

Anybody who has followed this column through the years will know that Hartlepool is the most politically interesting of towns.  The prejudices are familiar: Brexit Central; economically deprived provincials; monkey-hangers.  And that's just what my dad (a Hartlepudlian himself) gets called.  Let me take you to a part of Hartlepool which might make you think again about some of those prejudices.

Even a place like Hartlepool has to have a prestigious area, and Rural West ward is it.  Rural West has existed only since 2012; despite what might appear from the name and the map, it is the successor to the former Park ward in west West Hartlepool.  The name of Park ward was taken from Ward Jackson Park, which itself takes its name from Ralph Ward Jackson.  A classic early Victorian-era entrepreneur, Ward Jackson had been the driving force behind the Stockton and Hartlepool Railway which linked the ironworks at Stockton-on-Tees to the port at Old Hartlepool, on the headland.  Or, at least, that was the plan; the port at Old Hartlepool needed redevelopment to handle the railway traffic, and the town fathers spent so long arguing over this that Ward Jackson lost patience.  Instead he developed a series of railway-connected docks on sand-dunes a couple of miles to the south-west of Old Hartlepool, and founded a new town to serve them - West Hartlepool.  Ralph Ward Jackson would later go on to become the first MP for the two Hartlepools, serving under the Conserative banner from 1868 to 1874.  The Hartlepools merged into a single town in 1967 and now, still rather uneasily, form one borough.

Ward Jackson Park in turn gave its name to an area of housing called West Park, most of which has sprung up since 1980.  This is a series of privately developed housing estates which essentially house the middle-class of Hartlepool; in the 2011 census Park ward had by far the highest owner-occupation rates and the lowest no-qualification rates in the town.  This is Hartlepool's least-deprived area and has some of its most expensive housing - although still very cheap if you're looking at property through a London lens, with the median house in the ward going for around £160,000 to £200,000.  Drive along Catcote Road into the ward from the Owton Manor estate, and the change in affluence is palpable.

As the name Rural West might suggest, this is not just West Park, and the ward also contains six of the seven rural parishes within the Hartlepool borough boundary.  The largest of these is Greatham (Gree-tham, my dad always said) on the old road to Stockton, which was a ward of its own until 2012; Greatham ward's 2011 census return had the fifth-highest White British population (99.1%) and the sixth-highest population born in the UK (98.8%) of any ward in England and Wales.  The rest of Rural West ward was covered in 2011 by the rural Elwick ward, including a small part of Wynyard Village.  A recent and very exclusive development - Duncan Bannatyne and Alan Shearer are reportedly present or former residents - Wynward Village is mostly covered by Stockton-on-Tees council but part of it has spilled over the boundary.

Elwick and Greatham normally returned independent candidates to Hartlepool council, but before 2012 Park ward was the only reliable Conservative area of the town.  And it's Conservatism which has characterised Rural West's elections since its formation.  UKIP - who were well-organised in Hartlepool - ran second at each election from 2012 to 2018, when they gave up; in May's ordinary election the Conservatives had 58%, with an independent in second on 18% five votes ahead of Labour.

Defending for the Conservatives is Mike Young, who is finally getting a shot at a winnable seat: he fought the Seaton by-election last year and stood in De Bruce ward in May.  Independent candidate James Brewer returns to the fray after his second-place finish two months ago.  Completing the ballot paper are Yousuf Khan for Labour and Michael Holt for the Green Party.

<h2>Cockerton</h2>

Darlington council, County Durham; caused by the death of Labour councillor David Regan at the age of just 46.  Described as a committed community activist, Regan had served since 2007; he was originally elected for Cockerton West ward before transferring here in 2015.

Back in the day, when both were league sides, Hartlepool's main football rivalry was with Darlington.  A product in large part of the Industrial Revolution, Darlington was of course one end of the Stockton and Darlington Railway, which opened in 1825 to link the town with the Durham coalfield; and the railways stayed here to develop Darlington into a major engineering centre.  Engineering is still important to the town, but it says something for the post-industrial decline of the North that Darlo's largest employers now are EE, the mobile phone company.

No doubt some of EE's employees are electors in Cockerton ward.  Although the ward grew from and is named after a pre-existing village, most of Cockerton ward's electors live in the Branksome area, a post-war council estate suburb on the western edge of Darlington.  The present ward was created by boundary changes in 2015, merging the former Cockerton West ward (a safe Labour area) with part of Cockerton East (a key marginal); the 2015 result suggests that the new ward is safe Labour, the party's slate topping the poll with 43% to 25% for the Conservative candidate and 17% for the Green candidate.  There have been no local elections in Darlo since then, but the parliamentary constituency - a key marginal - was held by Labour in 2017 with almost no swing on two years before.

For some reason this by-election has attracted a large field of candidates.  Defending for Labour is Eddie Heslop, who fought a by-election in the neighbouring Mowden ward last year.  The Tories have made the interesting selection of Scott Durham, who is a sitting Durham county councillor for Aycliffe North and Middridge division; despite being an accountant as well, he is apparently confident that he can adequately sit on two different councils at once.  (We will return to this subject next week.)  The Green candidate is Terri Hankinson, who fought Brinkburn and Faverdale ward in 2015.  Also standing are independent candidate Joel Alexander, Kevin Brack (UKIP candidate for Darlington in 2017) for the anti-Islamic For Britain Movement, and Charlie Curry for the Liberal Democrats.

<h2>Old Town</h2>

Barnsley council, South Yorkshire; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Anita Cherryholme who had served since 2011.

For our last poll in the North we come to that stereotypical Yorkshire town, Barnsley.  The Old Town ward name might suggest a district of noted mediaeval or historic buildings, or an area where trade has gone on for many years; if that is indeed the case it's strange that Barnsley's tourist literature doesn't mention it.  There are essentially three parts to this ward: the Old Town district itself, which lies immediately to the north of Barnsley town centre; the Honeywell area to the east of the railway line, a deprived 1960s council estate; and the Smithies area on the far side of the River Dearne, which was administratively part of Monk Bretton until 1974.  The major employer within the ward is Barnsley Hospital, in the Old Town area.

For much of the Noughties this ward was a stronghold of the Barnsley Independent Group, a localist party which at its peak threatened Labour's control of the council.  However, the BIG were affected by a Labour resurgence from 2010 and have won Old Town ward only once since then, in 2014.  The BIG councillor didn't seek re-election in May and the ward was an easy pickup for Labour to restore their monopoly: they defeated an independent candidate by the score of 55-22.

This by-election will have a different feel to it as, for the first time since the ward was created in 2004, there is no independent candidate.  Defending for Labour is Jo Newing, who fought her home ward of Penistone West in May and unexpectedly and resoundingly lost it to the Liberal Democrats, who had no track record in that ward.  Returning from May's election here are Conservative candidate Clive Watkinson and the Lib Dems' Kevin Bennett.  Tony Devoy is hoping to mop up the regionalist vote as candidate of the Yorkshire Party, while the populist or far-right vote (depending on your political tastes) will be squabbled over by Gavin Felton of the Democrats and Veterans Party and Christopher Houston of the British National Party, which had some decent third places here a decade ago.
