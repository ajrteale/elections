<h2>Rural West</h2>

Hartlepool council, Co Durham; caused by the resignation of Ray Martin-Wells who was leader of the Conservative group.  He had served since 2010, originally elected as Ray Wells for Park ward before marrying Andrew Martin and transferring to Rural West ward in 2012.  In his resignation announcement Martin-Wells indicated that he was about to become a grandfather and was looking to spend more time with his growing family.

Anybody who has followed this column through the years will know that Hartlepool is the most politically interesting of towns.  The prejudices are familiar: Brexit Central; economically deprived provincials; monkey-hangers.  And that's just what my dad (a Hartlepudlian himself) gets called.  Let me take you to a part of Hartlepool which might make you think again about some of those prejudices.

Even a place like Hartlepool has to have a prestigious area, and Rural West ward is it.  Rural West has existed only since 2012; despite what might appear from the name and the map, it is the successor to the former Park ward in west West Hartlepool.  The name of Park ward was taken from Ward Jackson Park, which itself takes its name from Ralph Ward Jackson.  A classic early Victorian-era entrepreneur, Ward Jackson had been the driving force behind the Stockton and Hartlepool Railway which linked the ironworks at Stockton-on-Tees to the port at Old Hartlepool, on the headland.  Or, at least, that was the plan; the port at Old Hartlepool needed redevelopment to handle the railway traffic, and the town fathers spent so long arguing over this that Ward Jackson lost patience.  Instead he developed a series of railway-connected docks on sand-dunes a couple of miles to the south-west of Old Hartlepool, and founded a new town to serve them - West Hartlepool.  Ralph Ward Jackson would later go on to become the first MP for the two Hartlepools, serving under the Conserative banner from 1868 to 1874.  The Hartlepools merged into a single town in 1967 and now, still rather uneasily, form one borough.

Ward Jackson Park in turn gave its name to an area of housing called West Park, most of which has sprung up since 1980.  This is a series of privately developed housing estates which essentially house the middle-class of Hartlepool; in the 2011 census Park ward had by far the highest owner-occupation rates and the lowest no-qualification rates in the town.  This is Hartlepool's least-deprived area and has some of its most expensive housing - although still very cheap if you're looking at property through a London lens, with the median house in the ward going for around £160,000 to £200,000.  Drive along Catcote Road into the ward from the Owton Manor estate, and the change in affluence is palpable.

As the name Rural West might suggest, this is not just West Park, and the ward also contains six of the seven rural parishes within the Hartlepool borough boundary.  The largest of these is Greatham (Gree-tham, my dad always said) on the old road to Stockton, which was a ward of its own until 2012; Greatham ward's 2011 census return had the fifth-highest White British population (99.1%) and the sixth-highest population born in the UK (98.8%) of any ward in England and Wales.  The rest of Rural West ward was covered in 2011 by the rural Elwick ward, including a small part of Wynyard Village.  A recent and very exclusive development - Duncan Bannatyne and Alan Shearer are reportedly present or former residents - Wynward Village is mostly covered by Stockton-on-Tees council but part of it has spilled over the boundary.

Elwick and Greatham normally returned independent candidates to Hartlepool council, but before 2012 Park ward was the only reliable Conservative area of the town.  And it's Conservatism which has characterised Rural West's elections since its formation.  UKIP - who were well-organised in Hartlepool - ran second at each election from 2012 to 2018, when they gave up; in May's ordinary election the Conservatives had 58%, with an independent in second on 18% five votes ahead of Labour.

Defending for the Conservatives is Mike Young, who is finally getting a shot at a winnable seat: he fought the Seaton by-election last year and stood in De Bruce ward in May.  Independent candidate James Brewer returns to the fray after his second-place finish two months ago.  Completing the ballot paper are Yousuf Khan for Labour and Michael Holt for the Green Party.
