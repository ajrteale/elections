<h2>Westbury-on-Trym and Henleaze</h2>

Bristol council; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Clare Campion-Smith.  She had served since 2006, representing Henleaze ward until 2016 and this ward since then.  Campion-Smith was Lord Mayor of Bristol in 2015-16, and served twice in the city's cabinet; a former maths teacher, as cabinet member for children's services she was instrumental in creating 10,000 new primary school places in Bristol.  She was also the Liberal Democrat candidate for the Bristol North West constituency at the 2015 general election.  Campion-Smith is standing down on health grounds after being diagnosed with a lung condition.

We start the week in the largest city and the cultural centre of the West of England.  Westbury-on-Trym and Henleaze ward is an affluent northern suburb of Bristol, about three miles from the city centre.  This area arguably predates Bristol: in Saxon times there was a monastery at Westbury on Trym.  The monastery became a college in the 13th century and was largely destroyed in the Civil War: the Royalist commander Prince Rupert of the Rhine had used it as his headquarters, and when he left he had the buildings set on fire to prevent the Parliamentarians making use of it.

The area was mostly developed for housing in the Victorian and inter-war period as Bristol expanded, and is and has always been a favoured area of the great and good.  Westbury-on-Trym's list of notable residents included the horticulturist John Wedgwood, the Poet Laureate Robert Southey (who wrote his <em>Eclogues</em> here) and the archaeologist Alice Roberts.  Future names may well be added to this list: since 1924 the prestigious Badminton girl's boarding school has been located here, and the list of Old Badmintonians includes the Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi, the film actress Claire Bloom, the novelist Dame Iris Murdoch, the failed Lewisham parliamentary candidate Polly Toynbee and the former Conservative MP for the local Bristol North West constituency, Charlotte Leslie.

Leslie is one of those Tory MPs who is no doubt still cursing Theresa May's decision to go to the country last year: she lost Bristol North West to Labour on a swing of over 9%, a Tory majority of 4,500 being replaced with a Labour lead of the same size.  The swing away from the Conservatives last year was most pronounced in young and cosmopolitan areas, and while this ward may not be particularly young it is certainly cosmopolitan: the 2011 census picked up pockets in the ward with high proportions of people born in such exotic locales as Hong Kong, South Korea and Wales.  In 2011 this area was covered by two wards, both of which were in the top 100 in England and Wales for people in higher management or professional occupations: the former Henleaze ward came in at number 9 on that list and was also just outside the top 50 for population educated to degree level.  Truly this is where Bristol's educated professionals live.

These two wards may be similar socially but they were divergent politically.  The old Westbury-on-Trym ward was one of the strongest Conservative areas of Bristol, but Henleaze was a longstanding Lib Dem ward: the Tories came close to gaining it in 2009 and 2010, but then fell back.  The two were merged into one ward in 2016, and those contrasting political traditions collided to produce a split result: the Conservative slate polled 39% and won two seats, the Lib Dems had 32% and won the third seat, and Labour came in third with 16%.  There were clear personal votes in evidence for the Tories' Geoff Gollop, a longstanding Westbury-on-Trym councillor who was Tory candidate for the Mayor of Bristol election in November 2012, and for Campion-Smith who polled nearly twice the votes of Graham Donald, third on her party's slate.  The Lib Dem seat here is definitely not safe: Campion-Smith had a majority of just 70 votes over the third Conservative candidate.

Defending for the Liberal Democrats is the aforementioned Graham Donald, a retired senior civil servant who ended his working career as deputy clerk of the Privy Council.  The Conservatives have selected Steve Smith, a GP surgery manager and scout leader.  The Labour candidate is Teresa Stratford, an occupational therapist.  Completing the ballot paper is Ian Moss of the Green Party.

<h2>Kirkby la Thorpe and South Kyme</h2>

North Kesteven council, Lincolnshire; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Julia Harrison on health grounds.  She had served since 2015.

For our second eastern by-election we are in the flatlands of Lincolnshire.  The Kirkby la Thorpe and South Kyme ward is a rural ward, covering five parishes immedately to the east of Sleaford; indeed the ward includes Sleaford's Poets housing estate, which has spilled over the town boundary.  This is a ward dotted with mediaeval buildings: Kirkby la Thorpe's parish church dates from the twelfth century; Kyme Priory, now the parish church of South Kyme, was first attested in 1196; and Kyme Tower is all that's left of a fourteenth-century castle.  Clearly this was a bustling place in time immemorial, and Kirkby la Thorpe parish alone is thought to include the sites of three deserted mediaeval villages.

Things have got a bit more sleepy here since, and that goes for the ward's election results too.  This is a safely Conservative ward which was uncontested in 2007, the first contest on the present boundaries: in 2015 Harrison was elected by defeating the Lincolnshire Independents candidate 64-36.  The Conservatives are also not under serious threat in the local county division (Heckington), and in last year's general election the local Caroline Johnson polled 42,245 votes - the highest tally of any Conservative candidate that year.

Defending for the Conservatives is Dean Harlow, who lives in the village of Cranwell and is a parish councillor there.  The Lincolnshire Independents have nominated Mervyn Head, a South Kyme parish councillor.  Also standing are Sue Hislop for the Lib Dems and James Thomas for Labour.
