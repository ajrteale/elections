<h2>Salisbury St Paul's</h2>

Wiltshire council; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Mary Webb.

Selsdon Vale and Forestdale is the safest of the four Conservative defences this week.  It gets harder from here, as we turn to the South Western by-election today.  The city of Salisbury has electoral divisions which are mostly named after churches; St Paul's church, which was consecrated in 1853, lies on a roundabout to the west of Salisbury city centre where the main roads to Devizes and Wilton meet.  Or divide, depending on your point of view.  The St Paul's division extends north and west from that roundabout; boundary changes for the 2021 Wiltshire elections placed Salisbury railway station on the division boundary, while the division also takes in the industrial Churchfields area to the south of the railway line.

The modern Wiltshire council dates from 2009, and the Conservatives have won all four elections for Salisbury St Paul's to date on minority votes.  Indeed some of the past results here are best described as freak vote splits; in 2009 four candidates got over 20% of the vote here, and the winning Conservative score was just 27.5%.  Richard Clewer, the elected councillor here that year and in 2013, is now the leader of Wiltshire council - from the safer territory of Downton and Ebble Valley division.  The revised boundaries for St Paul's in 2021 delivered another freak vote split here: 32% for the Conservatives, 30% for the Lib Dems, 22% for Labour and 16% for the Greens giving a Conservative majority of just 32 votes.

This by-election follows the death of Mary Webb, who had joined Wiltshire council in 2021 and was in her first term.  Before becoming a councillor Webb had chaired the Wiltshire and Somerset branch of the Federation of Small Businessses, and had run a B&B in the city.

Their defending candidate is Katrina Sale, who may be a name to watch for the future; Sale was the Conservative candidate for Doncaster North in the December 2019 general election, cutting the majority of the former Labour leader Ed Miliband to under 2,500 votes.  Sam Charleston is back for the Lib Dems after his runner-up placing last year.  The Labour candidate is Tony Mears, who stood last year in the less-promising territory of Amesbury South.  If the Conservatives can't improve on their 32% score from May 2021 then they will lose this seat, because the withdrawal of the Greens has left this by-election with only those three candidates.

<h2>Longstanton</h2>

South Cambridgeshire council; a double by-election caused by the resignations of Liberal Democrat councillors Sarah Cheung Johnson and Alex Malyon.

We now come to the first two of the week's three Liberal Democrat defences, which come in a part of England which is changing fast.  Let's travel north-west of Cambridge into the countryside - or not, as the case may be.

The village of Longstanton is of long standing.  <em>Stantone</em> was recorded in the Domesday survey with 67 peasant tenants, a large number for a Cambridgeshire village at the time.  However, it took until the twenty-first century for population growth to get going here in earnest.

Yes, you read that right - the twenty-first century.  However, the seed for that population growth was the establishment of RAF Oakington, which opened in 1940; it was used during the Second World War by Bomber Command, and after the war for pilot training.  The RAF left Oakington in 1974, after which it was taken over by the Army and used as a barracks; the Army left in 1996, after which the Home Office took the site over as an immigration reception centre.  Although Oakington is a nearby parish, the airfield/barracks/immigration centre buildings were all in Longstanton ward.

The immigration centre had closed by the time of the 2011 census, at which time Longstanton ward had the same boundaries as Longstanton parish and returned one South Cambridgeshire councillor.  The 2011 census recorded 2,657 people in the ward, with a middle-class demographic and high levels of full-time employment.

Since then this area has changed out of all recognition.  The RAF Oakington site is being completely redeveloped as a new town called Northstowe, and the housebuilders are currently hard at work.  The maps here are from OpenStreetMap, whose contributors can usually do a faster job than the Ordnance Survey of updating their mapping; but even they are struggling with the development of Northstowe.  In the case of Northstowe Phase 2, the secondary school opened in 2019 but the houses couldn't be occupied until the A14 improvements to the south were finished; Northstowe Phases 3A and 3B, for which an outline planning application was submitted in 2020, will total 5,000 new homes with a link road to the A14, and will join Longstanton and Oakington together into one urban area.  This will be linked to the city of Cambridge and the fast-growing Huntington area by the Cambridgeshire Guided Busway, which runs along the north-eastern edge of the development site.

The Boundary Commission redrew Longstanton ward for the 2018 elections, expanding it to include Oakington village and increasing its representation from one councillor to two.  This was a major over-representation at first, but the ward was deliberately drawn small because of the Northstowe developments; its electorate increased by 42% from 2015 to May 2022, and there is some room for more population growth yet - although if Phases 3A and 3B come anywhere close to full occupancy the Boundary Commission are likely to be back here in short order.

South Cambridgehire council has had two elections on the current ward boundaries, in 2018 and 2022.  Both of these returned large majorities for the Liberal Democrats, who built on that to nearly gain the South Cambridgeshire parliamentary seat from the Conservatives in 2019 against the national trend.  The Conservatives lost both their majority on Cambridgeshire county council and the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough mayoralty in 2021; the Liberal Democrats are now leading the ruling coalition in the Shire Hall, while their transfers were crucial to the Labour gain in the mayoral election.

Longstanton ward forms the major part of the Longstanton, Northstowe and Over division of Cambridgeshire county council, which the Liberal Democrats gained in last year's county elections.  That put the county division into line with Longstanton ward, which voted Lib Dem narrowly in 2018 and decisively in May this year - the Lib Dem slate of Sarah Cheung Johnson and Alex Malyon had a 66-21 lead over the Conservatives.

Cheung Johnson - one of the few UK councillors of Chinese descent - and Malyon have both quit South Cambridgeshire council just a few months into their second terms, both of them citing difficulty in balancing their democratic and family duties.  They both have full-time jobs elsewhere, Malyon working as an NHS nurse and Cheung Johnson for Cambridge University.  A single by-election will be held to replace both of them.

Defending for the Liberal Democrats are Natalie Warren-Green and Lawrence Zeegen.  Warren-Green was one of the few unsuccessful Lib Dem candidates for South Cambridgeshire in May, contesting Swavesey ward; Zeegen, who is a professor of illustration (whatever that means), is one of Northstowe's new residents having moved in last year.  The Conservatives have selected Tom Bygott and Khadijeh Zargar; Zargar fought this ward in May, while Bygott was the losing Conservative candidate in the county elections here last year.  Also standing are Dan Greef and Anand Pillai for Labour, Colin Coe and Silke Scott-Mance for the Green Party, and independent candidate Debbie Poyser.

<h2>Chasetown</h2>

Lichfield council, Staffordshire; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Samuel Tapper.

We now travel north for two by-elections in the English Midlands, and this time I'll start on the west side.  Chasetown is a 19th-century pit village which has now been absorbed into the town of Burntwood.  Much of the ward's acreage is under water, but that's not the result of mining subsidence; the Chasewater reservoir dates from 1797, when it was built to supply water to the canals of Birmingham and the West Midlands.

However, Chasetown is not part of the Black Country urban sprawl and never became part of the West Midlands metropolitan area.  The ward does have a border with Walsall borough, but is cut off from the town of Brownhills to the south by the reservoir and the M6 Toll motorway.

Despite this, Chasetown does have a working-class demographic.  It continued to grow in population after the collieries closed, partly through the development of council estates and partly through white flight from the Black Country.  In the 2011 census 27% of Chasetown ward's households were socially rented; the ward boundaries have changed since then, but that's not likely to have changed the general picture.

Burntwood is part of the Lichfield parliamentary seat represented by Boris Johnson wannabe Michael Fabricant, and is contained within the Conservative-majority Lichfield district.  However, the two elections to Chasetown ward on the current boundaries have both returned a close result with one seat each for Labour and the Conservatives.  In 2015 UKIP and the second Labour candidate tied for the runner-up spot, 22 votes behind the winning Labour candidate.  The Conservatives' organisation here is clearly not great and they could only rustle up one candidate for the 2019 Lichfield elections; Labour were guaranteed one of the ward's two seats, but the Conservatives' Samuel Tapper won the other with a majority of just three votes.  Appropriately enough given that this is the town of the Chase, the Labour candidate who topped the poll in 2019 was called D Ennis - Darren, not Darragh, on this occasion.

Ennis subsequently finished as a close runner-up in the local Burntwood South division of Staffordshire county council last year, cutting the Conservative majority to just 80 votes against the national and Staffordshire trend.  And with a three-vote majority the Conservatives might have hoped not to have to defend a by-election here.

The outgoing councillor Samuel Tapper, who is a young man with his career ahead of him, has put his career first by leaving these shores for Japan.  He was due to start a teaching job there last month, and hopefully that's working out for him.

The by-election to replace Tapper will be another straight fight.  Defending from the blue corner is Norma Bacon, a former Lichfield councillor for Curborough ward in Lichfield city; she sought re-election in the neighbouring Chase Terrace ward in 2019, and was defeated.  Challenging from the red corner is Burntwood town councillor Paul Taylor.

<h2>Eastwood</h2>

Nottinghamshire county council; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Eddie Cubley.

Last week we saw the Conservatives lose a seat to Labour in Derbyshire county council at the southern end of the Erewash valley, in Long Eaton.  That poll was actually the first instalment of a three-part series, because we are back to the Erewash valley both this week and next week - but on the Nottinghamshire bank.

<blockquote>
I was born nearly forty-four-year ago, in Eastwood, a mining village of some three thousand souls about eight miles from Nottingham, and one mile from the small stream, the Erewash, which divides Nottinghamshire from Derbyshire. It is hilly country, looking west to Crich and towards Matlock, sixteen miles away and east and northeast towards Mansfield and the Sherwood Forest district. To me it seemed, and still seems an extremely beautiful countryside, just between the red sandstone and oak trees of Nottingham and the cold limestone, the ash trees, the stone fences of Derbyshire.
</blockquote>

Those are the words of one of the UK's best-known authors of the 20th century, David Herbert Lawrence, writing shortly before his early death in 1930.  D H Lawrence was born at 8a Victoria Street in Eastwood, a house which is now a museum dedicated to him; from the ages of 17 to 21 he was a pupil-teacher at a school in the town, before leaving Nottinghamshire to find fame in the wider world.

Lawrence identifies Eastwood's mining history, but the place was also important in the development of the railways.  Last week I mentioned how the Midland Counties Railway turned the Trent floodplain just outside Long Eaton into a major railway junction; that railway can trace its history back to the autumn of 1832, when a meeting of Nottinghamshire miners at the Sun Inn in Eastwood approved a scheme to extend the horse-drawn Mansfield and Pinxton Railway southwards to Leicester.  The need for outside investment, and the tangled railway politics of the 1830s, meant that the Midland Counties Railway as originally built did not in fact go to Eastwood or Pinxton; that link came later.  The modern-day railway at this point is on the Derbyshire side of the Erewash, with Eastwood served by Langley Mill station a short distance to the west.

The census return for Eastwood is a bit tangled because Broxtowe council, which covers this area, had its wards redrawn in 2015.  At the time of the 2011 census the town was covered by two wards, one of which - Eastwood North and Greasley (Beauvale) - included part of a neighbouring parish.  Both this ward and Eastwood South had a working-class demographic, although Eastwood North and Greasley (Beauvale) had high levels of owner-occupation while South ward had a significant amount of social housing.

Eastwood North and Greasley (Beauvale) ward split its two seats between Labour and the Lib Dems at the 2011 elections to Broxtowe council.  The Lib Dem slate in that election was a husband and wife, and it seems that this confused the counting team so much that Hazel Charlesworth - who was declared elected at the count - was mistakenly credited with votes that were in fact cast for her husband Bob.  The Election Court had to be called into session to sort this error out, and they reversed the result and declared Bob elected instead of Hazel.

The 2015 ward boundary changes gave Eastwood three wards all to itself, and in the 2019 Broxtowe council elections Labour clearly led across the division; they won four councillors to the Conservatives' one, although the shares of the vote were closer than the seat count might suggest.  The Conservatives are the largest party on Broxtowe council, but they are short of a majority and a Labour-led coalition is in control there.

However, the Tories represent Eastwood at other levels of government.  The Eastwood county division has been in Conservative hands in 2017, having previously voted Lib Dem in 2009 and 2013.  The Eastwood Lib Dem vote has collapsed in recent years resulting in the county division swinging to Labour in 2021 against the national and indeed the Nottinghamshire trend; new Conservative county councillor Eddie Cubley was elected to the county council last year by the narrow margin of 46-42.  Cubley was a passionate skydiver in his spare time, but his political career was clearly on an upward trajectory.

Indeed, Cubley first came to the attention of this column in February 2016 when he was elected to Broxtowe council in a by-election for Greasley ward (<em>Andrew's Previews 2016</em>, page 41).  He still held that seat at the time of his death in August.  The Greasley ward and the Broxtowe county division border each other but do not overlap, so the local parties and the returning officer have been able to arrange for the two by-elections to take place on different dates without calling anybody out to vote more than once.  The county by-election is today; the district by-election will take place next week.

With a marginal seat on the line, both the Conservatives and Labour have selected high-profile candidates for the Eastwood by-election.  Defending for the Conservatives is Mick Brown, who has run a bicycle shop and repair business in Eastwood since 1976; Brown has been a Broxtowe councillor since 1999, currently representing Greasley ward, and he was Mayor of Broxtowe in 2019-20.  Labour have reselected their candidate from 2021 Milan Radulovic, who has led the Labour group on Broxtowe council since 1995; he was Leader of the Council from 1995 to 2007, from 2011 to 2015, and since 2019, and was appointed MBE in the 2008 New Year Honours for services to local government in Nottinghamshire.  There is one other candidate, pub landlord Kane Oliver who is standing as an independent; at this point I must point out that Eastwood is part of the Ashfield parliamentary constituency, so if Jason Zadrozny has got involved in this campaign then write Oliver off at your peril.
