<h2><i>In memoriam</i></h2>

Before we start this week, this column would like to add its voice to the many tributes which have been paid to the late Queen Elizabeth II.  We shall not see her like again.  It's a tribute to Her Majosty's sheer longevity that it's difficult, at this point while the first draft of history is being written, to speak of a second Elizabethan age in the same way as that the first Elizabeth, James VI and I, the various Georges, Victoria or even Edward VII have given their names to periods of history.  The seventy years and seven months from February 1952 to September 2022 have seen this country and the world transformed, and - notwithstanding the catastrophists and gloom-mongers of the present - that change has been for the better.  The late Queen may not have been responsible for all of that, but she oversaw that change; there's a lot that wouldn't have happened without her sign-manual on a piece of paper.  Charles III can't reasonably expect such a long or consequential reign given his age, but his future - and ours - is yet to be written.  As with all new monarchs his first action will be to bury his predecessor, while the country he leads looks back over a long life well lived.

Much has been made of the gender transition of the monarchy and government, which took place with a single full stop in the middle of the statement which was released at 18:30 last Thursday:

<blockquote>
The Queen died peacefully at Balmoral this afternoon.

The King and The Queen Consort will remain at Balmoral this evening and will return to London tomorrow.
<blockquote>

But Demises of the Crown used to be far more significant constitutional events than just a temporarily-jarring change of pronouns.  Because so many things were done in the name of the old King or Queen, public appointments, royal charters and even legal action would lapse on the death of one monarch and have to be confirmed or renewed by the next.  For example, the 1215 Magna Carta was reissued by Henry III after his accession the following year, and the version of it which is currently in force is a 1297 confirmation by Edward I.  Until the Second Reform Act, the UK Parliament was automatically dissolved six months after a demise of the Crown: the last general election to be triggered in this way was in 1837, following the death of William IV.

Even now there is special provision for postponing a general election should a Demise of the Crown take place during a general election campaign, after Parliament has been dissolved.  The relevant provisions (in the Representation of the People Act 1985) have recently been amended to prescribe a two-week delay to polling day, with an option to vary that by a week either way.

General elections are the only electoral events for which such provision is made when a monarch dies.  In the case of any other elections, the returning officer is expected to carry on and deliver the election as previously planned; and that is the right thing to do.  There is never an interregnum, a vacuum in our monarchy; the same principle demands that there should always be a local council to take over when the term of the last one expires, and that casual vacancies should be filled within a reasonable time so that somebody else can take on the role and its responsibilities.  Pay respect to the late Queen, yes; but His Majesty's national or local government needs to carry on and that's just as important.

And there is historical precedent for this.  The death of George VI on Wednesday 6 February 1952 broke on the polling day for the first two by-elections of the 1951 Parliament, the tradition of Thursday by-elections for Parliament having not been fully established by then.  Two Conservative MPs, Brendan Bracken and Robert Hudson, had been elevated to the Lords, and the party successfully defended by-elections to replace them in Bournemouth East and Christchurch, and Southport respectively.  The following day Labour defended a by-election in Leeds South East, where James Milner had also received a peerage after losing the 1951 election for Speaker of the House of Commons; the winner of that by-election was a young man called Denis Healey, entering the Commons at the start of his long parliamentary career.  All of those three by-elections went ahead as scheduled.

As did the five council by-elections which were ongoing on the day Queen Elizabeth II died last week.  The political parties declared a truce in campaigning which will last until after the funeral, and the Returning Officer for Hartlepool went so far as to issue a disclaimer explaining that the by-election could not be called off.  Today's polls are also going ahead as scheduled.  The additional bank holiday for the royal funeral next week could cause issues for the electoral timetable, which this column will come to if necessary.

In the meantime there are six polls on 15th September 2022, and where better to start than the Greatest Town in the Known Universe?  But eat your herring first...

<h2>Rumworth</h2>

Bolton council, Greater Manchester; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Ebrahim Adia.

<img src="https://images.immediate.co.uk/remote/images.atlas.metabroadcast.com/api.pressassociation.com/content/5c970efc-a597-5268-8c1d-8bfe5b28f715.jpg?quality=90&resize=556,313"/>

Go on.  Was this the sort of image that came into your head when you thought of Bolton?  Well, for once in this column I'm going to tell you that you're not far wrong.  This is a publicity still for <em>Spring and Port Wine</em>, a 1970 film set and filmed in Bolton in which James Mason plays the head of a family.  Here's a clip.

https://youtu.be/_IrWLJxrTlk

The house in the clip still stands at the far end of Grisdale Road, in the Rumworth ward of Bolton, and anyone from the Greatest Town will be able to play the game of "identify the location".  However, the Rumworth of 1970 frozen in that film is rather different to the Rumworth of 2022.  Many (but by no means all) of the mills between St Helens Road and Deane Road have fallen victim to the predations of Fred Dibnah.  New industries which have moved in to replace textiles include the University of Bolton, part of whose campus is in Rumworth ward.  There's also Steaks on a Plane.

<img src="https://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/resources/images/11925479?type=responsive-gallery-fullscreen" />

Sadly Steaks on a Plane may not be much longer for this world, as the council have granted planning permission for an apartment block at its location on Deane Road.

This area has also changed socially since 1970.  If you made <em>Spring and Port Wine</em> in the same location today, a lot of the themes might well be exactly the same but the family would likely be Muslim.  Rumworth is a majority-Asian and a majority-Muslim ward, mostly of Pakistani heritage; this shows up in Rumworth appearing in the top 50 wards in the UK at the 2011 census for those looking after home or family (10.2%), and for those working in the wholesale and retail trade (25.6%).  One-sixth of the adults here had never worked or were long-term unemployed.

This column was last in Rumworth in 2016 (<em>Andrew's Previews 2016</em>, page 221), following the death of long-serving Labour councillor Rosa Kay.  I described Rumworth at the time as one of the strongest Labour wards in the country, and this was borne out as the by-election resulted in a Labour hold with 77% of the vote.  I also put in a big rant about the state of the town centre:

<blockquote>
British Home Stores, the flagship store on Victoria Square opposite the town hall - gone.  Prestons of Bolton, which has sold wedding rings to the fiancés of the North West for 150 years - gone.  Whitakers (now Beales) department store - closing down.  The Albert Halls, Bolton's premier event space in the town hall - closed for refurbishment for two years now and no guarantee that it will reopen in the same form, given that the council has laid off all the front-of-house staff.  The Victoria Hall, Bolton's premier concert hall run by the Methodists - living from week to week.  Your columnist could name several further prominent front teeth which have been knocked out of the town centre recently, with the prospect of more to come, and what are the council doing about it?  Refurbishing the town hall and building a new bus station so that people can come to a town centre that's not worth visiting on buses they can't afford to pay the fare for.  Great.  The contrast with Bury, which had the foresight to open a thriving new town centre extension at the low point of the recession, is striking.
</blockquote>

Six years on, BHS is still empty; Prestons of Bolton is still empty; Beales has been split up into a number of units, one of which is still empty; the Albert Halls has reopened but it's not exactly obvious what's been refurbished; the Victoria Hall is still going; and thanks to Andy Burnham's fare reforms, people can now travel to a town centre that's not worth visiting on buses which are much more affordable than before.  The £2 cap on single fares in Greater Manchester, introduced earlier this month, represents a 47% fare cut on my journey into town.

It would appear that a lot of Boltoners shared this opinion.  The Labour majority on Bolton council subsequently crashed and burned at the ballot box, and since 2019 Bolton has been the only metropolitan borough in the north of England run by the Conservatives.  The Tories have a minority administration which currently stands at 24 out of 60 councillors, a figure which includes Rumworth ward councillor Shamim Abdullah who won the 2016 by-election for Labour and defected to the Conservatives earlier this month.  In opposition are 18 Labour plus this vacancy, 5 Lib Dems, 4 independents and 8 councillors representing a galaxy of localist parties for the small towns outside Bolton proper.  I wrote in this column as recently as 2018 that it was surprising that nobody had tried to found a localist party in Bolton before; in this year's elections Kearsley ward had <em>three</em> different localist parties standing.

Rumworth ward remains securely in the Labour column, but the Conservatives have got their act together here over the last two years to poll a very respectable vote given the ward's social makeup.  In May's ordinary Bolton elections Labour won with 55% of the vote against 35% for the Conservatives.

The outgoing Labour councillor Ebrahim Adia had 20 years' service on the council, being first elected in 2002.  He had served as deputy leader of the borough.  Adia has resigned from the council as he has recently taken up a new job as deputy chair of the Lancashire and South Cumbria Integrated Care Board; he also has a senior role at the University of Central Lancashire in Preston.  Adia's successor will be up for re-election in May, when a new ward map for Bolton will be introduced resulting in minor changes to this ward.

Defending for Labour is Ismail Patel.  The Conservatives have reselected Ayyub Patel following his good result in May.  Also standing are the ward's regular Green candidate Alan Johnson, Rose Makar who is jointly nominated by Reform UK and the localist group Bolton for Change, and Charles Cooper for the Lib Dems.

<h2>Oak Tree</h2>

Mansfield council, Nottinghamshire; caused by the death of Mansfield Independent Forum councillor Vaughan Hopewell.

For our Midlands poll this week we have come to a ward on the eastern fringe of Mansfield.  The Oak Tree ward lies to the east of Oak Tree Lane and includes Oak Tree Leisure Centre and Oak Tree Primary School.  There are probably a fair few actual oak trees here, because the ward includes two large golf courses belonging to Mansfield Golf Club and Sherwood Forest Golf Club.  The main employer here is Tesco, who have a large Tesco Extra store off Oak Tree Lane.

The ward's housing is concentrated in its north-west corner, and it is a 1970s council estate.  A massive 70% of Oak Tree ward's households are socially rented, which is the second-highest figure for any ward in England (only Windmill Hill ward in Runcorn, since redrawn, was higher in the 2011 census).  Oak Tree also had the second-highest figure for any ward in England for long-term sickness/disability (14.9%, behind Everton ward in Liverpool), and made the top 80 in England and Wales for unemployment (9.6%).  It includes Mansfield's most deprived census district.  If you're looking for a peripheral council estate ward, you will not find a better example than this.

But if you're looking for an example of how peripheral council estates vote, you're probably out of luck because we're in Mansfield.  Mansfield council went over to the elected mayoral system in 2002, and since then it has been closely fought at local elections between Labour and an independent slate, the Mansfield Independents.  This  independent group held the mayoralty until 2019, with the borough's first mayor Tony Eggington twice coming from behind to beat Labour on transfers: on the second occasion in 2011, he had 12,860 votes in the runoff to Labour's 12,613, a majority of 67 votes.  Such come-from-behind victories will not be possible in future, as the Conservatives have legislated to change the electoral system for mayors to first-past-the-post without a referendum - a precedent which might well come back to bite them in future.

The 2019 Mansfield election resulted in Labour winning the Mansfield mayoralty for the first time; Andy Abrahams defeated the Mansfield Indepenents mayor Kate Allsop in the runoff by 7,930 votes to 7,928, a Labour majority of two votes.  Don't let anybody tell you your vote never changed anything.  However, Abrahams is having to work with a hung council because Labour lost their majority on Mansfield council in 2019, winning 15 seats against 13 for the Mansield Independents, 6 other independents and two Conservatives.  One of those Labour seats went to Abrahams, resulting in a by-election in Sandhurst ward which was gained by the Mansfield Independents.  One of the two Conservative councillors was subsequently elected as MP for Ashfield, and the Conservatives held a by-election in May 2021 in Oakham ward to replace him.

That poll was held alongside the Nottinghamshire county council elections in which the Mansfield Independent Forum were wiped out; the borough's nine Nottinghamshire county council seats went to 6 Conservatives, 2 Labour and an independent.  The best Conservative performance came in the two-seat Mansfield East division, in which the Mansfield Independents councillors Martin Wright and Vaughan Hopewell lost their seats.  This is the county division which covers Oak Tree ward, which Hopewell represented on Mansfield council.  The Conservative council total includes Ben Bradley, who successfully did the chicken run from his previous seat of Hucknall North to Mansfield North; Bradley has been the Conservative MP for Mansfield since June 2017, and following the 2021 elections he became leader of the majority Conservative group on Nottinghamshire county council.

As stated, Vaughan Hopewell was the Mansfield councillor for Oak Tree ward.  He had represented the seat since 2011, originally being elected for Labour before defecting to the Mansfield Independents.  In 2019 he was re-elected under his new colours with a 56-33 lead over Labour.  Hopewell passed away in June, having fallen ill while out with his family.

Given everything which has happened politically in the Nottinghamshire coalfield since then, even with the lack of recent campaigning this by-election could be an important straw in the wind for next year's Mansfield mayoral and council elections.  Defending for the Mansfield Independents is Gemma Canlin, who runs a property firm and social enterprise but whose localist credentials may be dented by giving an address in Ashfield district.  The Labour candidate is Paul Henshaw, who has been a county councillor for Mansfield West since 2017.  Also standing are Neil Smith for the Conservatives, Julie Tasker for the Freedom Alliance and Milo Tooley-Okonkwo for the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition.
