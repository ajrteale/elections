"All the right votes, but not necessarily in the right order"

</p><p>
There are three by-elections on 31st March 2022, with the Conservatives defending two and Labour one.  Two of our polls this week are in Yorkshire, so let's go to the wrong side of the Pennines:
</p><p>
<h2>Mayfield</h2>
</p><p>
Scarborough council, North Yorkshire; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor David Chance.
</p><p>
Whitby.  It's hard to find a town more picturesque: the houses cheek-by-jowl on the steep slopes leading down to the ships on the River Esk, with the dramatic ruins of Whitby Abbey overlooking everything.  This is the town of Captain Cook, of the Synod of Whitby, of Bram Stoker's Dracula, of goth culture, of superlative fish and chips and aggressive seagulls.
</p><p>

</p><p>
Put all those mental impressions back away, because Mayfield is the part of Whitby the tourists don't generally go to.  This is the town's south-western ward, lying away from the beach, the cliffs and the narrow and steep streets of the town centre around the Esk estuary.  Here instead is housing along the main road towards Middlesbrough, and the tiny village of Ruswarp in the Esk valley, which the last stop for trains before the terminus at Whitby.
</p><p>
In the 2011 census Mayfield ward was in the top 10 wards in England and Wales for those employed in mining and quarrying: the Boulby potash mine, a few miles to the west of Whitby, is a major local employer.  It was also in the top 20 wards for those in part-time employment, reflecting the mainly seasonal nature of Whitby's tourist economy.
</p><p>
<img alt="Scarborough, 2019" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/scarborough19s.svgz" />
</p><p>
Whitby is recognised by the ONS as the centre of its own Travel to Work Area, but it's too small to run a district council of its own.  At present the town's local government is administered from down the coast in Scarborough, producing a local government district which has had a bit of a reputation for instability in recent years.  Scarborough council returned a Conservative majority in 2015, but the 2019 elections here returned 16 Conservative councillors, 14 independents, 13 Labour, 2 Greens and a UKIP councillor.  The Tory group has since fallen apart and there are now only 9 Conservative councillors left plus this vacancy: the council website currently lists 21 independent councillors, in four different council groups.  A coalition of Labour with one of the independent groups is running the show.
</p><p>
The Scarborough Conservatives may have lost ground overall in 2019, but they did gain a seat that year in Mayfield ward which had split its two seats between the Tories and Labour in 2015.  The Labour win appears to have been a bit of a fluke, and the 2019 election in Mayfield gave us a return to normality with 47% for the Conservatives, 31% for Labour and 22% for UKIP.
</p><p>
David Chance had been one of the Conservative councillors for Mayfield ward since 2011.  He followed that up in 2013 by being elected as county councillor for Whitby/Mayfield cum Mulgrave division, which combines this ward with a number of villages in the North York Moors National Park to the west as far as Staithes.  Chance sits on the county council's executive, holding the "Stronger Communities" portfolio.  He has resigned from the district council to free up more time.
</p><p>
Clearly whatever it was that Chance needed more time for couldn't wait a year.  Local government reorganisation is in the works for North Yorkshire which will result in Scarborough district council being abolished in a year's time.  Effectively it's a takeover by the county council, which will operate on a unitary basis from April 2023 and result in Whitby's local government being administered from faraway Northallerton.  It must be a reasonable shout that Chance will seek re-election to North Yorkshire county council in May, but he won't be doing so from Whitby/Mayfield cum Mulgrave division which is disappearing in boundary changes.  For those elections Mayfield ward will combine with most of Whitby West Cliff ward to the north to form a new Whitby West division.
</p><p>
Before then we are looking for a new Scarborough councillor to take us up to abolition in April next year.  Defending for the Conservatives is John Nock, a former Scarborough councillor who lost his seat in the neighbouring Whitby West Cliff ward in 2019.  Nock is a Whitby town councillor for the town's Stakesby ward, which covers the majority of this area.  Labour have selected Gerald Dennett, who was this ward's Labour councillor from 2015 until losing his seat in 2019.  UKIP have not returned, so the ballot paper is completed by two more Whitby town councillors: Lee Derrick stands for the regionalist Yorkshire Party, while Linda Wild, who was a Conservative candidate in the 2019 Scarborough council elections, is contesting this by-election as an independent.

<h2>Wheatley Hills and Intake</h2>
</p><p>
Doncaster council, South Yorkshire; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Daniel Barwell.
</p><p>
<img alt="Doncaster, Wheatley Hills/Intake" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/doncaster-wheatley-hills-intake.webp" />
</p><p>
We stay in Yorkshire for our second by-election, but move from a small town to a big one.  Doncaster was a Roman town, growing up around a fort called <em>Danum</em> at a point where the River Don could be crossed.  This was an alternative route for Ermine Street, the main road from London to York: the main Ermine Street route struck due north from Lincoln and involved a ferry crossing of the Humber estuary.  Doncaster is still on the main communication routes from London to York: the East Coast Main Line passes through the town and the A1 motorway bypasses it.
</p><p>
One thing which brings many people to Doncaster, year in year out, is horse racing.  Races have been held on the Town Moor in Doncaster since the sixteenth century: its modern successor, Doncaster Racecourse, has been at the same location since 1776.  In that year Colonel Anthony St Leger organised a horse race which has been repeated here almost every year since: the St Leger Stakes is the longest and oldest of the UK's five classic flat races.  This race takes place in September, near the end of the flat season, and has passed into financial folklore as the point of the year when the markets start to come back into life after the summer lull: as the old saying goes, "sell in May, go away, come back on St Leger Day".
</p><p>
Doncaster Racecourse is also important when election time comes around.  Doncaster council usually hires the racecourse buildings for its election counts, most recently for the May 2021 local elections.  Last year the whole of Doncaster council together with the borough's elected mayor were up for re-election: the Labour mayor Ros Jones was re-elected with a 60-40 margin over the Conservatives in the runoff, and the Labour party also retained its majority on the council.  There are no council elections in Doncaster this May, but the racecourse buildings will be required again for the count of Doncaster's votes in the South Yorkshire mayoral election.
</p><p>
The racecourse lies at the southern end of Doncaster's Wheatley Hills and Intake ward, which is based on housing east of the town centre and runs north to the River Don.  Wheatley Hills lies next to the Don, with Intake to the south of it.  Both of these names reflect the area's agricultural past: Wheatley is derived from the Old English for a woodland clearing where wheat is grown, while Intake is a Yorkshire term for land which has been taken into cultivation.  The ward includes the town's general hospital, the Doncaster Royal Infirmary.
</p><p>
Wheatley Hills and Intake ward was created in 2015 from territory which was previously the eastern parts of Town Moor and Wheatley wards.  Town Moor was Lib Dem-voting until the advent of the Coalition, when it transferred its allegiance to Labour; Wheatley ward was generally Labour with the exception of a Lib Dem win in 2007, and developed a significant populist right vote in the early part of the last decade.  The English Democrats, who held the Doncaster mayoralty at the time, finished a strong second in Wheatley in both 2010 and 2011.
</p><p>
To some extent this was reflected in the first election to Wheatley Hills and Intake ward in 2015, in which UKIP were runners-up some distance behind Labour.  The ward has remained safely Labour since then: the 2021 election here gave 40% to the Labour slate, 26% to the Conservative slate and 18% to the Yorkshire Party candidate.
</p><p>
Daniel Barwell was first elected here in May 2021, topping the poll on the Labour slate.  In February 2022, nine months into his term of office, he was arrested by the Metropolitan Police on an extradition warrant.  Barwell is wanted in the US state of Ohio on suspicion of conspiracy to import psilocybin, the active ingredient in magic mushrooms, into the United States.  After being refused bail by Westminster magistrates, who remanded him in custody awaiting extradition proceedings, Barwell resigned from Doncaster council.  This column does from time to time cover councillors who have appeared before the courts (more on that theme next week, and the week after that), but in twelve years of Andrew's Previews I can't recall any previous case of a councillor being extradited to another country.
</p><p>
This week's Labour by-election defence has been entrusted to Yetunde Elebuibon, who describes herself on her Twitter as a "community activist, IT consultant, former NHS worker [and] promoter of digital literacy".  The Conservative candidate is Michael Angus, who is a parish councillor in Tickhill some miles to the south.  Standing for the Yorkshire Party is Andy Budden, an Army veteran who currently works in car sales; he was the Yorkshire Party candidate for Mayor of Doncaster last year.  Completing the ballot paper are Jennifer Rozenfelds for the Green Party (who fought this ward last year) and Dean Southall for the Liberal Democrats.

<h2>Melton Sysonby</h2>
</p><p>
Melton council, Leicestershire; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Tejpal Singh Bains.
</p><p>
Earlier in this week's column Andrew's Previews noted the local government reorganisation which will result in the abolition of Scarborough district, a unit with around 109,000 souls.  We finish this week with a council which has just half of that headcount but is still apparently deemed viable by the powers that be.  Melton council, with a population just creeping over 50,000, is England's smallest shire district by population.
</p><p>
Over half of the borough's residents live in the town of Melton Mowbray, which Andrew's Previews visited in November last year.  This is a surprisingly industrial town, with food and food processing being major local employers.  Appropriate for the town which gave us its namesake pork pie.
</p><p>
<img alt="Melton, Melton Sysonby" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/melton-melton-sysonby.webp" />
</p><p>
Sysonby ward is the north-western of Melton Mowbray's six wards, lying along the main road towards Nottingham.  This ward has existed on its current boundaries since 2003 and has been consistently Conservative, but not always safely so.  In 2011 Labour were just six votes short of winning a seat here, while in 2015 the final Conservative seat was won with a majority of 21 votes over an independent candidate.  In 2019 the Conservative slate of three was opposed only by a single Green and a single Labour candidate; shares of the vote were 45% for the Conservatives, 29% for the Greens and 26% for Labour.
</p><p>
<img alt="Melton, 2019" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/melton19s.svgz" />
</p><p>
The resigning councillor Tejpal Bains, who was in his early 30s, had represented Melton Sysonby ward since 2015.  He served as the borough's mayor in 2017-18, becoming not only Melton's first ethnic minority mayor but also (aged 27) its youngest mayor.  Away from the council Bains is a solicitor specialising in property and conveyancing, and his social media suggests that he has recently taken on a new role in his career.
</p><p>
The candidate list for this by-election has a rather unusual look, as it appears that all the contesting parties have tried to secure the top spot on the ballot by selecting candidates whose names begin with A.  The defending Conservative candidate Siggy Atherton, who is the coordinator of a local foodbank, must be rather surprised to find herself appearing last alphabetically.  The Greens have not returned but Labour are trying again with their candidate Pip Allnatt, who contested the Melton West county division (which covers most of this ward) in last year's Leicestershire county elections.  However, top of the three candidates on the ballot paper is Jim Adcock, who is Sysonby ward's first candidate this century for the Liberal Democrats.
