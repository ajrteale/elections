Seven by-elections on 3rd February 2022, and we start with the Parliamentary Special:

<h2>Southend West</h2>

House of Commons; caused by the death of Conservative MP Sir David Amess.

<blockquote>
...and that's why Southend should be a city!
</blockquote>

Sir David Amess MP had a habit of ending many of his speeches with that rousing call to arms, seemingly regardless of whether it was on-topic.  You can see why.  Southend-on-Sea is a major urban area in its own right, with the modern borough having a population of over 180,000.  However, until last year it was a town, and a town of relatively recent vintage.  The name itself is a bit of a giveaway: this is the <em>south end</em> of the village of Prittlewell.

There was very little in Southend until the 1790s, when a hotel was developed to take advantage of the miles of beaches on the north side of the Thames estuary.  But Southend's location away from the major roads held it back, and it wasn't until the coming of the railways that the place started to develop properly as a seaside resort.

The modern Southend borough was incorporated in 1892, and has since grown to take in two other towns on the coast.  To the east is Shoeburyness, which was a fishing port with a military presence thanks to its strategic location at the northern end of the Thames estuary.  To the west is a town whose history goes back to the Domesday survey, Leigh-on-Sea.  This was an important Thames-side port in the Tudor and Stuart periods, but by 1740 it was silting up and in decline.  The railways gave Leigh a shot in the arm, with Leigh-on-Sea railway station giving the town frequent links to Southend and London.  By 1918 the area near the coast was completely built-up with Edwardian housing, and Leigh-on-Sea urban district had been annexed by Southend borough in 1913.  Modern Leigh-on-Sea, which has merged with Southend into a single urban area, is an attractive commuter base.

The Eastwood area to the north of Leigh-on-Sea, which became part of Southend in 1933, was slower to develop and much of its housing is post-war.  Eastwood is adjacent to the southern end of the runway of Southend Airport.  This airfield was bought in 2008 by Stobart Group (now Esken Ltd), who started an aggressive expansion drive to attract regular passenger flights and low-cost airlines to "London Southend".  It worked for a while, with the airport handling just over two million passengers in 2019; but unfortunately COVID has put paid to all of that, and London Southend Airport no longer has any scheduled passenger flights.  Wizz Air plan to return in March with a service to Bucharest, and easyjet have announced some charter flights to Spain for this summer.

In 1885, when single-member constituencies became the norm for UK parliamentary elections, all this development lay in the future.  The redistribution of that year left Essex with just two parliamentary boroughs (Colchester and the newly-enfranchised West Ham), with the rest of the county being divided into eight constituencies.  Seven of these were named after towns, with the exception being a constituency which stretched along the northern bank of the Thames estuary from Rainham to Foulness.  Today this area roughly corresponds to the modern boroughs of Thurrock, Castle Point, Rochford and Southend-on-Sea, with parts of the London Borough of Havering thrown in as well.  This constituency - sparsely-populated at the time - was called South East Essex.

South East Essex was a Conservative seat in the period 1885 to 1918, with the exception of the 1906 Liberal landslide, but had rather a large turnover of MPs.  Its first MP was William Makins, who beat the Liberals' William Wills (head of the Wills tobacco family, and at this point the <em>de facto</em> head of the British tobacco industry) by 3,707 votes to 3,500.  Makins had represented the predecessor seat of South Essex since 1874, but he left this constituency in 1886 to seek election as MP for Walthamstow, successfully.

William Makins was succeeded as MP for South East Essex in 1886 by Carne Rasch, an Essex county alderman with a military background.  Rasch was re-elected in 1892 (narrowly) and 1895 (comfortably).  In 1900 he left this constituency to seek election as MP for Chelmsford, successfully.

The khaki election of 1900 returned a South East Essex MP with a distinguished military background.  Edward Tufnell was a veteran of the Second Anglo-Afghan War and the Gordon Relief Expedition up the Nile.  He defeated the Liberal candidate Rowland Whitehead by 57% to 43%.

Tufnell didn't seek re-election in 1906, and that general election returned the same 57-43 margin - but this time in favour of Rowland Whitehead.  A son of Sir James Whitehead who had served as Lord of Mayor of London, Rowland Whitehead was a barrister who quickly got to the bottom of the greasy pole: he served his entire time in Parliament as a PPS to Liberal cabinet ministers.  As a Liberal, he was the last non-Conservative MP for Southend-on-Sea.

South East Essex reverted to the Conservatives in January 1910 with the victory of John Kirkwood.  A Boer War veteran, Kirkwood was the owner of the Yeo Vale estate in north Devon and also owned land in Ireland.  He defeated Whitehead in January by 11,199 votes to 9,288, and was re-elected in December 1910 by 10,108 votes to 8,891.  These are high vote totals, and reflect that the constituency's electorate had grown by 155% since the seat was drawn up in 1885.

John Kirkwood resigned from the Commons in early 1912.  The Liberals decided not to contest the resulting South East Essex by-election, and the Conservative candidate was declared elected unopposed when nominations closed on 16 March.  He was Viscount Elveden or, to give him his proper name, Rupert Guinness.

Thus began a long history of association of Southend with the Guinness brewing family, who would go on to serve as MPs for the town for 85 unbroken years.  Rupert was the heir to the Guinness brewing empire and to the earldom of Iveagh.  He had served in the Boer War, and at this time he was a captain in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve and commanding officer of HMS <em>President</em>.  Rupert's political career had started in 1908 when he won a by-election in Haggerston, gaining the seat from the Liberals, but he had lost in the 1910 general elections.  He had an unusually strong knowledge of science for a politician, specialising in agricultural research - not surprising for somebody whose business depended on the successful cultivation of hops, barley and other grains.

Southend-on-Sea became a county borough in 1914 and was enfranchised in 1918 as a borough constituency, entitled to send one MP to Parliament.  Rupert Guinness sought re-election as MP for Southend, received the coalition government's coupon, and won the 1918 election easily against competition from an Independent Conservative and the Liberals.  Southend went on to continue to be a safe Conservative seat, but Rupert got an almighty shock here in the 1923 general election when he defeated the Liberal candidate Douglas Young by 15,566 votes to 15,453, a majority of just 113.  The following year a rematch with Young resulted in a majority of over 12,000 for Guinness.

Rupert Guinness succeeded to his father's titles (and business) and entered the Lords in 1927, becoming the second Earl of Iveagh.  For the resulting Southend by-election of 19 November 1927 the Conservatives selected his wife.  Gwendolen Guinness was from the upper class herself as a daughter of the 4th Earl of Onslow, who had served as Governor of New Zealand and in the Balfour cabinet.  The Countess of Iveagh, as she now was, defeated the Liberal candidate Dougal Meston with a majority of 9,309.  She was not seriously threatened in the seat thereafter, and polled 86% of the vote here against Labour in the 1931 general election.

Gwendolen Guinness stood down at the 1935 election, and passed the seat on to her son-in-law Henry Channon.  "Chips", as Channon was known from university onwards, was quite the contrast to the Anglo-Irish brewing family he had married into.  Born in Chicago in 1897 into a family which owned a fleet of Great Lakes vessels, Chips had moved to England in 1920 and never looked back across the pond.  He became a naturalised UK citizen in 1933, which enabled Channon to add a political career to a successful penchant for social climbing.

Unfortunately for his political career, Chips Channon ended up on the wrong side of most of the big issues of the late 1930s.  He was a strong supporter of Edward VIII, hosting the King, the Duke of Kent, Wallis Simpson and a number of European royals (including his Oxford contemporary Prince Paul of Yugoslavia) for a dinner at his house on Belgrave Square in November 1936.  As such, George VI held him in low esteem.  Chips was also in favour of appeasement with Nazi Germany and strongly supported Neville Chamberlain's leadership, and as such he had no chance of ministerial office after Churchill came to power.  His final political goal - elevation to the Lords - never came to pass either; given the number of homosexual affairs he had with high-profile figures, that may well have been for the best.  Chips' extensive diaries, which he left to the British Museum, were so sensitive that they are only now being published in full; the version released in 1967, which cemented his reputation as a political diarist, was extensively bowdlerised.

The 1950 redistribution divided the Southend constituency into two seats, West and East, with both new constituencies taking in areas from South East Essex which had been annexed by Southend county borough since 1918.  Southend East gained Shoeburyness, Southend West took in the Eastwood area.  This created the Southend West constituency we have today, as boundary changes since 1950 have been fairly minor.  After being given a scare by the Attlee landslide in the previous Southend seat, Chips Channon secured a strong majority in the new Southend West in 1950 and was not seriously challenged thereafter.

Sir Henry Channon died in October 1958 at the age of 61, having served as an MP for 23 years.  For the resulting first Southend West by-election, held on 29 January 1959, the Conservatives selected his son Paul Channon.  Paul was just 23 years old and was in the middle of an undergraduate degree at Christ Church, Oxford at the time of the by-election; he had previously done National Service in the Blues and Royals, which included time in Cyprus.  The Beaverbrook press were not impressed with what looked like a display of nepotism, and the <em>Daily Express</em> went into campaign mode against Channon, but his grandmother the Countess of Iveagh was delighted.  As she remarked, "I think you have done right by backing a colt when you know the stable he was trained in."

Paul Channon won the 1959 Southend West by-election easily, defeating the Liberal candidate Heather Harvey (a writer and former civil servant) by 8,179 votes.  He was the Baby of the House for the remainder of the 1955-59 Parliament and the whole of the 1959-64 Parliament.  Paul was never seriously challenged in the seat, going on to win eleven terms of office and serve as MP for Southend West for 38 yeas.  Among the candidates he saw off were the former Scotland rugby player Gurth Hoyer-Millar, who was the Liberal candidate here in 1964 and 1966; and the long-serving shadow leader of the Lords Angela Smith, who was the Labour candidate in 1987.

Channon very quickly started to climb the greasy pole, serving from 1961 to 1964 as parliamentary private secretary to Rab Butler - a job his father had done many years earlier.  He was a junior minister throughout the Heath administration and for the first years of the Thatcher administration, hosting talks at his home in 1972 between the Northern Ireland secretary Willie Whitelaw and the IRA.

In 1986 Paul Channon finally made Cabinet rank as trade and industry secretary, succeeding Leon Brittan in the wake of the Westland affair.  This coincided with a high-profile business scandal involving Guinness shares, which was an obvious conflict of interest for Channon.  He was reshuffled in 1987 to become transport secretary, in which post he had to lead the UK government's response to the King's Cross fire, the Clapham rail crash, the Lockerbie bombing and the Kegworth air crash.  Channon was dismissed from the frontbench in 1989.

Paul Channon retired to the Lords in 1997, taking the title of Lord Kelvedon after his residence at Kelvedon Hall.  For the 1997 general election the Southend West Conservatives broke the habit of 85 years and did not select a member of the Guinness family, or indeed anyone from the upper class.  Instead they chose David Amess.  Essex born and bred, Amess had had a number of jobs before entering politics, including underwriting and teaching in a primary school.  He started his political career in 1982 by being elected to Redbridge council in east London; in 1983 he was elected as MP for the Essex constituency of Basildon.  His re-election for that constituency in 1992 was one of the early results on that election night, and one of the first indications of the unexpected Conservative win that year.  The Basildon seat had been split up for the 1997 general election, and neither of the successor seats looked particularly winnable for Amess; Southend West proved to be a much safer berth for him.  His closest call in this seat came in the Blair landslide of 1997, when Amess had a majority of 2,615 over the Liberal Democrats' Nina Stimson.  In December 2019 David Amess polled 59% to Labour's 28%, and enjoyed a majority of 14,459 votes.  Nina Stimson was the Lib Dem candidate in that election as well.

Like Paul Channon before him, David Amess sat in the Commons for 38 years.  Unlike Paul Channon, most of that long parliamentary career was spent on the backbenches; Amess did ten years as parliamentary private secretary to Michael Portillo, but never made it to ministerial office.  Instead, most of his career was spent supporting his constituents first and other causes second, as the many tributes paid to Amess after his death demonstrated.  In 2000 he was successful in the ballot for private members bills; the result was the Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Act 2000, which required the government to implement a strategy to reduce fuel poverty.  He was knighted in 2015.  Campaigning from Amess resulted in a statue of Raoul Wallenberg being erected in London and, posthumously, city status for Southend-on-Sea.

Amess was one of six survivors in Parliament from the 1983 intake, and all six of the MPs ahead of him in the seniority rankings - Sir Peter Bottomley, Barry Sheerman, Harriet Harman, Sir Edward Leigh, Nick Brown and Jeremy Corbyn - were older then he was.  Had he lived and sought re-election in 2024, he might well have become Father of the House in due course.  He had the stories to match that long parliamentary career, many of which were published in his 2020 memoir <em>Ayes and Ears</em> (<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ayes-Ears-Survivors-Guide-Westminster/dp/1913025926">link</a>) which was shortlisted for the Parliamentary Book Awards.

This by-election arises from Amess' shocking death in October 2021.  He was fatally stabbed during a surgery at the Belfairs Methodist church in Leigh-on-Sea, in his constituency.  He was 69 years old.  A man has been charged with Amess' murder and with preparing terrorist acts, and a trial is scheduled to start next month.  I shall say no more than that.

These are exactly the circumstances in which, less than six years ago, we lost the Labour MP Jo Cox.  At the by-election to replace her (<em>Andrew's Previews 2016</em>, page 251) none of the established parties opposing Labour stood a candidate.  The precedent set in Batley and Spen in 2016 has been repeated here, and this will not be a party political by-election.

The withdrawal of all serious parties other than the defending Conservatives has cleared the way for Anna Firth, who defeated candidates including Paul Channon's daughter-in-law Katie Channon to secure the Conservative nomination for Southend West.  At the time of her selection Firth was a Sevenoaks councillor in Kent; she has stood for Parliament twice before, most recently losing the marginal seat of Canterbury in December 2019.  Outside politics she is a barrister.  Firth has recently moved to this constituency and resigned her seat on Sevenoaks council; Andrew's Previews will be back in a month's time to cover the resulting by-election in Brasted, Chevening and Sundridge ward.

This will not be a party political by-election, but that doesn't mean it won't be uncontested.  The days when MPs could be elected unopposed - as Rupert Guinness was in the 1912 South East Essex by-election - are long over.  As happened in Batley and Spen in 2016, Firth is opposed by a number of candidates from the right or far-right fringes of British politics.  There are eight of them on this ballot paper: Christopher Anderson has the nomination of the anti-lockdown Freedom Alliance; the former Brexit Party leader Catherine Blaiklock is standing for the English Democrats; Olga Childs is an independent candidate; Ben Downton is the candidate of the Heritage Party; former Britain First and EDL figure Jayda Fransen is on the ballot as an independent candidate; UKIP have selected their immigration spokesman Steve Laws; Graham Moore stands for the English Constitution Party; and Jason Pilley, who was an independent candidate here in June 2017 and has since contested a number of Southend-on-Sea council elections with very few votes to show for it, is the "Psychedelic Movement" candidate.

There are some previews which are not pleasant to write, and this is one of them.  Whatever your position on the political spectrum, I hope you can agree that the world would be a better place if David Amess were still alive.  May he rest in peace.

<h2>Berkhamsted West; and<br/>
Boxmoor</h2>

Dacorum council, Hertfordshire; caused respectively by the resignations of Liberal Democrat councillors Nicky Woolner and Liz Uttley.

As well as the parliamentary by-election in Southend West there are six local by-elections taking place today.  They fall neatly into three pairs, with the Conservatives, Labour and Lib Dems defending two each.  I'll start with the two Lib Dem defences, which both fall on the western edge of Hertfordshire.

Nestled in the Chiltern hills can be found the town of Berkhamsted, lying in the Bulbourne valley.  This forms a relatively direct route through the Chilterns which is traversed by the ancient road of Akeman Street, the Grand Union Canal and the West Coast Main Line.  There are frequent and fast trains here from Euston, which have turned modern Berkhamsted into something of a commuter town.  Wool trading, which was the town's major industry in mediaeval times, is long gone.

When the West Coast Main Line was first opened in July 1837 its first, temporary, northern terminus was Boxmoor railway station.  This station is now called Hemel Hempstead, after the town whose centre is located a mile away.  That inconvenient distance was due to opposition from local landowners, forcing the railway company to propose a route further away from the town centre.  Hemel Hempstead became a New Town in the twentieth century leading to major development: the modern Boxmoor ward covers the area north of the railway station and west of the modern town centre.  Again, we see a bit of an educated commuter demographic here: Boxmoor ward has the highest proportion of people with degrees of any ward in Hemel.

Hemel Hempstead is the main town in the curiously-named Dacorum district at the western end of Hertfordshire, which also takes in Berkhamsted and Tring.  Berkhamsted is part of the South West Hertfordshire parliamentary seat, which is so safely Conservative that the party could easily withstand a split in the right-wing vote at the 2019 election, caused by the former Tory MP and Cabinet minister David Gauke seeking re-election as an independent candidate.  Gauke finished second, polling 26% of the vote.

Hemel Hempstead itself was a Labour constituency at the height of the Blair government's powers, but there are now no Labour councillors in the town or indeed the district.  Instead, local opposition to the Tory-controlled Dacorum council comes from the Liberal Democrats, who surged in 2019 to win 19 seats - by far their best performance in the district this century.  The ruling Tory group fell to 31 seats, with the remaining seat going to an independent candidate.

Two of the wards which fell to the Lib Dems in 2019 were Berkhamsted West and Boxmoor, both of which had consistently returned Conservative candidates since the current ward boundaries were introduced in 2007.  Berkhamsted West had consistently had the Lib Dems in second place and was close in a May 2017 by-election; Boxmoor had no recent Lib Dem tradition at all and the party had finished in fourth place at the 2015 election.  Despite that the Lib Dems polled 42% of the vote in Boxmoor in 2019, against 32% for the Conservatives and 14% for Labour; the party apparently ran hard on a local controversy regarding the Hemel Hempstead Leisure Centre, which is within the ward.  Berkhamsted West gave 50% to the Lib Dem slate, 28% to the Conservatives and 15% to the Greens.

These good Lib Dem performances were repeated in last year's elections to Hertfordshire county council.  The Lib Dems gained Hemel Hempstead Town division (which includes nearly all of Boxmoor ward) and Berkhamsted division (which covers the eastern half of Berkhamsted West ward), and slashed the Conservative majority in Bridgewater division (a rural-based division which takes in the western half of Berkhamsted West).  Berkhamsted West ward lies on the border with Buckinghamshire, and the Chesham and Amersham constituency - Lib Dem-held since a parliamentary by-election last year - is just over the county line.

Can the Lib Dems keep up this good recent record?  We shall see.  Defending for the party in Boxmoor is Simy Dhyani, who gives an address outside the district in Rickmansworth; she works in this ward as a restaurant manager.  The Conservative candidate is Brandon Geary, who drives Metropolitan line trains on the London Underground.  Labour have selected Cameron Brady-Turner, who is a caseworker and researcher for a frontbench Labour MP.  Completing the ballot paper is Sherief Hassan for the Greens, who also fought this ward in 2019 and 2015.

In Berkhamsted West the defending Lib Dem candidate is Anne Foster.  The Tories' Gary Moore has had no less a figure than Priti Patel turn up to help with his campaign.  The Greens have selected Kevin Fielding, a retired science teacher and trustee of Berkhamsted Common.  Labour's Peter Scott completes the candidate list here.

<h2>Campden and Vale</h2>

Cotswold council, Gloucestershire; caused by the disqualification of Conservative councillor Mark Annett, who failed to attend any meetings of the council in six months.

We now turn to the two Conservative council defences this week.  From the Chiltern hills we travel west to the Cotswold hills to what is, like Berkhamsted, another ancient market town with a history of wool-trading.  This is Chipping Campden, the northernmost town in Gloucestershire, which is still full of old buildings - some dating from the 14th century - all built in that attractive yellow Cotswold limestone.

Chipping Campden lies at the top of the Cotswold escarpment, and to the north of the town the ground falls away steeply into the Vale of Evesham.  This is the Vale part of the Campden and Vale ward, covering the parishes of Willersey, Saintbury, Weston Subedge, Aston Subedge and Gloucestershire's northernmost village, Mickleton.

Here we have another recent Lib Dem hotspot.  In 2019 the Liberal Democrats took overall control of Cotswold council for the first time, defeating a Conservative administration which had ruled since 2003.  That administration had been a favourite target of <em>Private Eye</em>'s "Rotten Boroughs" column over the years, particularly with reference to a long-running scandal involving Cotswold Water Park near Cirencester.  The leader of the council for much of this period was Lynden Stowe, who represented Campden and Vale ward until 2019 and is still the local county councillor.  Stowe handed over the leadership in 2016 to his ward colleague Mark Annett, who stood down from the top job in 2018 on health grounds.

Annett was re-elected in 2019, but finished behind his running-mate Gina Blomefield who is further down the alphabetical ballot paper - this is often a sign that Annett didn't have much of a personal vote.  The Tory slate was safely returned in Campden and Vale ward nonetheless, polling 44% against 31% for UKIP and 26% for the Lib Dems.

Mark Annett was thrown off Cotswold council in December for not turning up to any meetings in six months.  One theme which runs through local press reports on this by-election is how <em>unfair</em> that is, to which the response of this column is, well, them's the rules.  Constituents do have a right to reasonably expect that their councillor is doing <em>something</em>.  Six-month rule disqualifications are not by any means unusual - this column writes about one or two every month on average - and when all's said and done it's the councillor's responsibility to make sure that they're attending enough meetings to keep their position.  Some councils are more proactive at warning councillors about their attendance than others, but if you fall foul of the rule you only have yourself to blame.  Annett isn't even the most high-profile person to fall foul of the six-month non-attendance rule this decade: Christian Wakeford, the recently-defected Labour MP for Bury South, was kicked out of Pendle council in March 2020 for exactly the same reason.

Anyway, this by-election is the result of Annett's disqualification.  Defending for the Conservatives is Tom Stowe, who runs the family printing firm Vale Press; he is the son of county councillor and former Cotswold council leader Lynden Stowe.  The UKIP candidate who was runner-up here in 2019 stood for Gloucestershire county council last year on the Reform UK ticket, got nowhere and has apparently decided not to return for this by-election.  That leaves Stowe's opposition coming from Danny Loveridge of the Lib Dems in a straight fight which looks rather unpredictable, given that the Lib Dems didn't contest the local county division last year.  According to the latest edition of "Rotten Boroughs" Tom Stowe has previously threatened to sue Loveridge if he repeats any <em>Private Eye</em> stories in his newsletter.  Should any such legal papers be served in future they won't have far to travel: Stowe and Loveridge are next-door neighbours in Mickleton.

<h4>Spital</h4>

Tamworth council, Staffordshire; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Paul Brindley.

Our other Conservative defence comes at the northern end of Tamworth.  Spital ward is the northern end of the town, lying to the north-west of Tamworth railway station and based on the Perry Crofts area.  Demographically this ward is much of a muchness, rather like most of Tamworth's ten wards.

Tamworth council has been solidly in Conservative hands this century with very stable voting patterns.  The ward boundaries here haven't changed since 2002 with annual elections since then: every contest in Spital ward from 2002 has seen a Conservative win with 44-55% of the vote, with Labour in second on 25-39% (with the exception of 2016 which was a straight fight).  Last year's election was at the extreme end of those ranges, with a 55-25 Conservative lead; that poor Labour performance also carried through to the Staffordshire county elections, where they finished third in the local Perrycrofts division behind the Conservatives and an independent candidate.

Outgoing councillor Paul Brindley had been first elected in 2019, and has spent much of his time on the council working with the town's COVID Self-Isolation Support Group.  He was appointed BEM in last year in recognition of that work.  Brindley stood down from the council in December, believing he could have more an impact away from the council.

Defending for the Conservatives is Chris Cooke, a name which triggers unhappy memories of the last time this column covered Tamworth in detail (<em>Andrew's Previews 2018</em>, page 190); it turns out Tamworth has had two councillors in recent years with that name, and I mixed them.  The candidate here is (and I have checked this) Chris Cooke junior, who followed in his father's footsteps by representing Tamworth's Glascote ward from 2016 to 2021; he was elected in 2016 as a UKIP candidate, and lost re-election last year as an independent.  For this by-election he has the Conservative nomination.  Labour have reselected Dave Foster, another former Tamworth councillor, who stood here in 2021.  Also returning from 2021 is independent candidate Huw Luxton, who completes the ballot paper.

<h2>Evington</h2>

Leicester council; caused by the death of Labour councillor Ratilal Govind.

We now turn to the two Labour defences this week, both of which are in city wards.  By far the more multicultural of these is Evington ward, which lies on the eastern side of Leicester and takes in the city's general hospital and the City of Leicester College, which is a sixth-form college and secondary school.  Former pupils here include Tony Blair's former supremo Alistair Campbell and the former England footballers Gary Lineker and Emile Heskey.

The Evington ward takes in a couple of council estates, but Evington itself still has the air of a village which has been swallowed up by the growth of Leicester.  We can see this in the area's election results: as late as 2003 Evington was a fairly safe Conservative ward, by 2011 it was safe Labour.  The 2011 census revealed Evington to be a majority-Asian ward, with all the major subcontinental religions well represented: Evington was in the top 50 wards in England and Wales for Sikhism (12.3%) and Hinduism (20.1%).  Boundary changes for the 2015 election saw Evington take in the eastern half of the former Coleman ward, with an increase from two councillors to three.  Coleman ward was safe Labour, and the Conservatives are now a long way from winning here: in the May 2019 Leicester city elections Labour had a 54-22 lead in the current Evington ward.

Mind, the local Labour party has troubles of its own.  We are in the Leicester East constituency, which was represented from 1987 to 2019 by Labour MP Keith Vaz.  (Apologies to any readers who may have been playing the Keith Vaz game.)  Vaz has been a controversy magnet for years, and what finally did for his parliamentary service was a six-month suspension handed down by the Standard Commissioner following a sex-and-drugs scandal.  Normally a suspension of this length would result in a recall petition, but by the time the punishment was handed down the 2019 general election was imminent; Vaz did not seek re-election.

The Leicester East Labour Party then selected as their parliamentary candidate Claudia Webbe, a decision which was made in haste and which the party is now repenting at leisure.  Leicester born and bred, Webbe was at the time of her selection a member of the party's National Executive Committee and sat on Islington council in London.  She duly won the seat but with a drastically-reduced majority of 6,019 votes, and she has since been thrown out of the Labour party after being found guilty of harassment in October 2021.  Westminster magistrates sentenced her to ten weeks' imprisonment, suspended for two years, and 200 hours of unpaid work.  Normally a conviction of this nature would result in a recall petition, but Webbe is appealing against the conviction so any petition will have to wait until the appeal is decided.  The Conservatives gained a seat from Labour in a Leicester city council by-election in July last year, in the neighbouring ward of Humberstone and Hamilton; their national poll ratings have fallen a bit since then, but this doesn't exactly tell a story of a happy local Labour party.

The Evington by-election follows the death of Labour councillor Ratilal Govind in December, following a period of illness.  Govind had first been elected in 2015.  Defending this seat for Labour is Shahid Ullah Khan, as we can see from the following tweet:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today in Evington Village was the launch of the campaign to elect Shahid Ullah Khan as the new Labour Councillor for Evington. Thank you everyone being there. <a href="https://t.co/F4UGzUuT3e">pic.twitter.com/F4UGzUuT3e</a></p>&mdash; Leicester East Labour (@EastClp) <a href="https://twitter.com/EastClp/status/1479805924655128576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 8, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Clearly the Labour campaign has some work to do to win over the guy flicking V-signs through one of the windows at the back.  Put him down as a "possible".  The Tory candidate is Jenny Joannou, who is opposing a possible housing development on open space off Sedgebrook Road in the ward.  Completing the ballot paper are Ursula Bilson for the Greens, Zuffar Haq for the Liberal Democrats and David George for the far-right For Britain Movement.

<h2>Ancoats and Beswick</h4>

Manchester council; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Marcia Hutchinson.

We finish for the week in the big city of Manchester, with a ward of two halves.  Ancoats is a rather trendy place these days, lying immediately to the north-east of Manchester city centre in a district of old terraces and mills, many of which are being turned into apartments for city living.  That doesn't mean there aren't new buildings here: consider the Daily Express Building on Great Ancoats Street, which looks like a modern steel-and-glass skyscraper but was built in 1939.  It is the youngest listed building in Greater Manchester.

Ancoats may be a hipster's paradise these days but back in the day it was of course a cotton mill district.  Beswick, on the far side of the River Medlock, was very different in character.  This area was dominated by Bradford Colliery, which had been in operation since the 17th century, and by associated heavy industry.  Even after centuries of extraction there is still a lot of high-quality coal down there, but the colliery closed in 1968 because the area around it was completely built up: the risk of causing subsidence to nearby property was too great for mining to continue.  The colliery site was regenerated at the turn of the century and is now occupied by the Etihad Stadium, built for the 2002 Commonwealth Games and now the home of Manchester City FC.

It may be a surprise to learn that Beswick and Bradford were once dominated by the blues not just in football but in politics as well.  From 1885 to 1918 this area (along with Ardwick and the university area on Oxford Road) was part of the Manchester East constituency, which was represented by Arthur Balfour from 1885 to 1906: that period included his three years (1902-05) as a Conservative Prime Minister.  Another party leader associated with the area was J R Clynes, who led the Labour party to their first second-place finish at the 1922 general election: Ancoats was part of Clynes' constituency for many years.

Politically, Manchester is now dominated by Labour: the latest composition of the city council has 92 Labour councillors, one each for the Lib Dems and Greens, and two vacant seats of which this is one.  The city centre has seen major population growth in recent years, and its ward boundaries were redrawn in 2018 to match.  That boundary review created Ancoats and Beswick ward, from territory which had previously been the western part of Ancoats and Clayton ward and Bradford ward.

In its three elections to date this area, as with almost all Manchester wards, has been safe Labour.  The 2021 elections gave Labour 58% of the vote here, the Lib Dems polling 22% to take second place from the Greens.  The councillor elected that year was Marcia Hutchinson, a former solicitor and Windrush Community Historian (according to her Twitter) who was appointed MBE in 2010 for services to cultural diversity.  Hutchinson appears to have become quickly disillusioned with local politics and didn't take long to fall out with the Labour whips; she resigned midway through her first year on the council.

Defending for Labour is Gareth Worthington, who works for CityCo ("the city centre management company") with a focus on the night-time economy.  This selection seems to have wound up rather a large number of people, with Hutchinson and her supporters crying foul over racism (Hutchinson is of black Caribbean descent, Worthington is white) while the Lib Dems have raised questions as to whether Worthington's employment makes him ineligible to stand for election as a Manchester councillor.  The Lib Dem candidate is Alan Good, a software developer, who returns after his second-place finish last year.  Completing an all-male ballot paper are Chris Perriam for the Greens and Alexander Bramham for the Conservatives.
