One by-election on Wednesday 23rd February 2022.  Never mind Big Jet TV, it's time for Big Poll TV:
</p><p>
<h2>Stanwell North</h2>
</p><p>
Spelthorne council, Surrey; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Jim McIlroy.
</p><p>
Yes, it's a Wednesday.  Yes, there's a by-election today. And why not?  By-elections in the UK tend to be held on Thursdays, but that's only a tradition: any working day will do, and sometimes it's more convenient for everyone involved to hold a by-election on a different day.  In this particular case, Spelthorne council has scheduled a full council meeting for 7pm on Thursday this week, with the budget for 2022-23 as the main item on the agenda.  Holding the Stanwell North by-election today will allow the winner of the by-election to make a start on their councillor career straight away, by attending tomorrow's meeting and voting on the council's budget.

</p><p>
Full attendance may be important here, because the outcome of the budget meeting is not a foregone conclusion.  The 2019 elections to Spelthorne council returned a Conservative majority with 23 seats out of a possible 39; but this has since fallen apart.  There are 17 councillors left in the Conservative group plus this vacancy, but they are outnumbered by a rather fractured opposition.  The latest composition has 7 Liberal Democrat councillors (following a by-election loss to the Conservatives last year), two Conservative splinter groups totalling six seats, and two seats each for independent councillors, the Green Party, Labour and a Labour splinter group.  The council leader is a Lib Dem who rules in coalition with one of the independent groups: that coalition only controls 9 out of 39 seats on the council, so some deals may need to be cut in order for their programme to get through.
</p><p>
This might seem atypical for a council in true-blue Surrey, but then (a) recent local government results for the Surrey Conservatives have been generally awful, and (b) Spelthorne isn't really Surrey at all.  This is one of the few parts of Middlesex which escaped incorporation into Greater London in 1965, at which point it was added to Surrey in default of any better ideas.  The Spelthorne district is entirely north of the Thames, and is based on the outer London suburbs of Sunbury, Ashford and Staines, together with smaller places like the film and TV studio centre of Shepperton and the village of Stanwell.
</p><p>
Stanwell has suffered rather badly from development to serve the needs of the big city it lies on the edge of.  About half of Stanwell North ward's acreage is taken up by the Staines Reservoirs and the King George VI Reservoir, which provide drinking water for the city.  The ward's demographics also look more London than Surrey: there is a significant Asian population in the ward, with Sikhs forming the second-largest religious group here.  There are high numbers of households in shared ownership, and in the 2011 census Stanwell North ward was in the top 60 in England and Wales for those with "Level 1" qualifications (fewer than 5 GCSE passes or equivalent).
</p><p>
But there's one census statistic that really marks this place out.  A massive 27% of Stanwell North's workforce are employed in the transport and storage sector, which is the second-highest figure for any ward in England and Wales and the highest in south-east England.  Only Felixstowe West came higher than this figure; and indeed, of the top 12 wards for transport and storage according to the 2011 census, six were in Felixstowe or the immediately surrounding area.  The other six also have something geographically in common: they border Heathrow Airport.

</p><p>
Stanwell North lies immediately to the south of the Heathrow airport perimeter, behind the cargo terminal, and the ward includes a number of large warehouses for air freight.  Heathrow's passenger traffic fell off a cliff in 2020 for reasons which need no explanation, but cargo had taken up some of the slack so Stanwell North might have been affected slightly less badly than other Heathrow-area wards by the events of the last two years.  The residents of the village of Stanwell Moor, which lies immediately off the western end of Heathrow's south runway, may on the other hand have been grateful for a reduction in aircraft noise...
</p><p>
The last Spelthorne council elections were in May 2019 before all of this blew up.  Stanwell North ward has been trending to the left over this century, and in 2019 Labour topped the poll here for the first time.  The Labour slate polled 45% of the vote and won two seats, the Conservatives polled 34% and won the other seat, and UKIP (the only other party to stand) finished on 20%.
</p><p>
The ward forms most of the Stanwell and Stanwell Moor division of Surrey county council, which from 2009 until 2021 was the only Labour seat in the council chamber (which has recently relocated from Kingston upon Thames to Reigate).  Since 2013 the county councillor here has been Robert Evans, who was a Labour member of the European Parliament for London from 1994 to 2009; Evans was also the Labour candidate who lost the Brent East parliamentary by-election in 2003.  However, at parliamentary level Spelthorne is a safe Conservative seat, which has been represented since 2010 by the business secretary and <em>University Challenge</em> champion Kwasi Kwarteng.
</p><p>
This by-election is for the final Conservative seat in Stanwell North, vacated by Jim McIlroy who had served since 2019.  In his short time in office McIlroy had briefly made it to deputy leader of the council, but he lost that position following the Lib Dem/independent takeover.
</p><p>
Defending for the Conservatives from a guaranteed place at the bottom of the alphabetical ballot paper is Michael Zenonos, who runs a logistics firm; he was a losing candidate in the last by-election to Spelthorne council, finishing second to the Greens in the neighbouring Staines ward last July.  Labour, who will have high hopes of gaining this seat, have reselected their unsuccessful candidate from 2019 Jon Button.  UKIP have not returned, so the ballot paper is completed by Paul Couchman for the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition.
