Three by-elections on 9th June 2022:
</p><p>
<h2>Southgate</h2>
</p><p>
Crawley council, West Sussex; caused by the disqualification of Labour councillor Mike Pickett, who failed to attend any meetings in six months.
</p><p>
After a week off for the Jubilee it's time for Andrew's Previews to start June with a bang.  We're off to a crucial by-election in a key marginal ward of a key marginal constituency in the South of England.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/crawley-southgate.webp" alt="Crawley, Southgate" />
</p><p>
One thing which southern England is not short of is New Towns.  These tend to be politically volatile places.  If we look at the list of eleven New Towns designated in the first wave of 1946-50, ten are currently in Conservative-held parliamentary seats (the exception being Peterlee).  However, in the Blair landslide 25 years ago ten of the eleven first wave New Towns were in Labour-held parliamentary seats (the exception being Bracknell).  It's clear that here we have a special class of volatile marginal seat.
</p><p>
One of the purest examples of this phenomenon is Crawley, where the parliamentary seat and the borough council have exactly the same boundaries.  Crawley has been a Conservative parliamentary seat since 2010, and had a large Conservative majority in December 2019.  However, the district council has been much more closely fought: the Conservatives have only controlled it from 2006 to 2014, and a Labour majority or minority administration has been running the town since then.  In last month's local elections Labour were widely reported as having gained overall control of Crawley.
</p><p>
Well, the situation is a bit more complicated than that.  Following the May elections the composition of Crawley council stood at 18 Labour councillors, 17 Conservatives and one vacancy.  This is in respect of Labour councillor Mike Pickett, who had served since winning a by-election in October 2014.  Pickett has been seriously ill for some time and that has prevented him from attending council meetings; he has now fallen foul of the six-month non-attendance rule.  This column wishes him well for the future.
</p><p>
Pickett's ward was Southgate, which lies immediately to the south of Crawley town centre, with Crawley's railway station on its northern boundary.  This is New Town development from the 1950s to the 1970s.  One relic of the original New Town plan is that Crawley's street signs are colour-coded to show which of the 14 New Town neighbourhoods they are part of: Southgate's colour is dark brown.  The New Town development revealed pre-Roman archaeological remains in the area, with much evidence of ironworking from the local High Weald stone: this includes two Iron Age furnaces found in what is now Goffs Park.
</p><p>
The 2011 census return shows that Southgate's economic base is strongly skewed towards the transport and storage sector (15% of the workforce) and the administrative sector (9.2%), with the number of residents employed in both those industries within the top 50 wards in England and Wales.  The high focus on transport is explained by the fact that Crawley borough's largest employer is Gatwick Airport.
</p><p>
This ward has survived successive boundary reviews to have unchanged boundaries since at least 1979 and possibly earlier.  Its electoral history over the last 43 years shows that Southgate is a key marginal which often flips back and forth between Conservative and Labour: the score in ordinary elections from 1979 onwards stands at 19 Labour wins and 15 Conservative.  Small majorities include a win for the Conservatives in 1984 by nine votes, a win for the Conservatives in 2003 by three votes, Labour winning the final seat at the all-up election in 2004 by three votes, and a Labour win in 2018 by fourteen votes.  At the all-up election in 2019 Labour won all three seats here, but the Conservatives gained a seat in 2021 to give split representation.  That was held at the same time as the 2021 West Sussex county election, at which the Conservatives gained the Southgate and Gossops Green county division which covers most of this ward.
</p><p>
Last month's ordinary election to Crawley council resulted in a Labour hold of Southgate ward by 47% to 39%, a majority of 167 votes.  That may well give some confidence to Labour, who must hold this by-election to preserve their council majority.  If Labour lose this seat then they will be relying on the casting vote of the mayor, Jilly Hart, to get their programme through until May 2023.
</p><p>
Defending for Labour is Bob Noyce, who was a candidate for the safe Conservative ward of Pound Hill North and Forge Wood in 2021.  The Conservatives have selected Jan Tarrant, who was a councillor here from 2015 to 2019 and was the losing candidate here in May.  Completing the ballot paper is Richard Kail for the Green Party.

<h2>Penshurst, Fordcombe and Chiddingstone</h2>
</p><p>
Sevenoaks council, Kent; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Sue Coleman.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/sevenoaks-penshurst-fordcombe-chiddingstone.webp" alt="Sevenoaks, Penshurst/Fordcombe/Chiddingstone" />
</p><p>
Our other two by-elections this week are Conservative defences in large rural wards.  To start with we travel east from Crawley for a return visit to Penshurst, Fordcombe and Chiddingstone.  Located about seven miles west of Tunbridge Wells and Tonbridge, this is a ward with a fair amount of history.
</p><p>
Consider, for example, Penshurst Place.  This is a fourteenth-century stately home which was the birthplace of the Elizabeth poet and soldier Sir Philip Sidney; it's still held by his descendants, the Viscounts de l'Isle.  Also consider the nineteenth-century stately home of Chiddingstone Castle, built for the Streatfeild family and now held in trust for the nation.  The rest of Chiddingstone village is almost entirely owned by the National Trust, who have preserved its many surviving chocolate-box Tudor buildings.
</p><p>
These are popular filming locations.  Chiddingstone is in particular demand for Tudor-set productions and much of the exterior shots for <em>Elizabeth R</em> were recorded here.  Penshurst Place has been the setting for scenes from <em>The Princess Bride</em>, <em>Merlin</em> and <em>The Other Boleyn Girl</em>.  This last one is particularly appropriate for a number of reasons: Anne Boleyn's childhood home at Hever Castle is just over the ward boundary, Henry VIII is known to have used Penshurst Place as a hunting lodge, and Geoffrey Streatfeild - one of the Chiddingstone Streatfeilds - had a part in the series.
</p><p>

</p><p>
This may look like a bucolic rural area in the middle of nowhere, but the ward is well within commuting range of London and consequently has a middle-class commuter demographic.  Politically it's a true blue area.  Sue Coleman, whose resignation in April prompted this by-election, was elected unopposed at the last Sevenoaks council elections in 2019.  She had served since winning a by-election in August 2017 (<em>Andrew's Previews 2017</em>, page 209) with a 59-34 margin over the Lib Dems - a swing to the Conservatives compared with the 2015 election.  The ward is also part of a safe Conservative division of Kent county council (Sevenoaks Rural South), and is part of the Tonbridge and Malling constituency represented by the chairman of the Commons Foreign Affairs committee, Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat.
</p><p>
Defending for the Conservatives is Ian Butcher, from the nearby town of Edenbridge.  In a straight fight he is opposed by a returning candidate from the 2017 by-election.  This is Richard Streatfeild, who is another of the Chiddingstone Streatfeilds (he's Geoffrey's older brother), and is a former Army officer with a military MBE and extensive experience of Helmand and the <em>Today</em> programme.  Last year Richard Streatfield was elected to Kent county council, gaining the Sevenoaks Town division from the Conservatives, and he again stands in this by-election for the Liberal Democrats.

<h2>Mattishall</h2>
</p><p>
Breckland council, Norfolk; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Ian Martin.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/breckland-mattishall.webp" alt="Breckland, Mattishall" />
</p><p>
For our final poll this week we have come to the centre of Norfolk.  Mattishall is a large village of over 2,000 electors, located 11-13 miles west of Norwich.  It gives its name to a ward which stretches south-west to the villages of Yaxham, Garvestone and Hardingham located south of Dereham.  These are deeply rural areas, with agriculture forming a major part of the local economy.
</p><p>
The village of Garvestone was the birthplace in 1561 of one of the more unjustly forgotten scientific figures of yesteryear.  Edward Wright was a cartographer and mathematician of the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries whose work <em>Certaine Errors in Navigation</em>, first published in 1599, was the first mathematical treatment of Mercator's map projection.  <em>Certaine Errors</em> was derived from navigational studies which Wright had made during the 1589 Azores Voyage, a successful bout of what amounted to piracy against Spanish ships for which Cambridge University granted Wright leave of absence.  Now there's an excuse for a sabbatical.  At the time of Wright's early death in 1615 he was in the middle of translating Napier's table of logarithms from Latin into English.  He has left his mark on England as the surveyor of the New River, a waterway from Hertfordshire to Islington which is still a major part of London's water supply.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/breckland19s.svgz" alt="Breckland, 2019" />
</p><p>
Until ward boundary changes in 2015 water was also important for elections in this corner of Norfolk.  Before then Mattishall was part of the Two Rivers ward, the rivers in question being the Tud and the Yare, while the villages from Yaxham to Hardingham were contained within the Upper Yare ward.  Those were safe Conservative units and so is the current Mattishall ward.  At the last Broadland elections in 2019 the Conservative slate won with 47%, outgoing Conservative councillor Pablo Dimoglou polled 28% in a failed attempt to be re-elected as an independent, and Labour finished on 25%.  The two Norfolk county council divisions which cover the ward are also safe Conservative.
</p><p>
Ian Martin was first elected for the ward in 2019, gaining Dimoglou's seat.  He has resigned on health grounds, with his health challenges including a broken shoulder, chronic fatigue syndrome and a recent diagnosis of early-stage motor neurone disease.  Again, this column wishes him well for the future.  Martin's resignation statement also expressed some disillusionment with party politics.
</p><p>
Defending for the Conservatives is Paul Plummer, a retired blacksmith from Garvestone.  The outgoing Conservative councillor Ian Martin has, however, endorsed independent candidate and Yaxham parish councillor Maggie Oeschle.  The Labour candidate is Kendra Cogman; she is a regional officer for the National Education Union who was co-opted to Dereham town council last year.  Those are your three candidates.
