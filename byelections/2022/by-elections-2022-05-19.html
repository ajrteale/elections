"All the right votes, but not necessarily in the right order"

</p><p>
There is one by-election taking place on 19th May 2022:
</p><p>
<h2>Ellel</h2>
</p><p>
Lancaster council; caused by the disqualification of Conservative councillor David Whitworth.
</p><p>
Just one local by-election taking place today, but - wow - what a location to cover.  If you want variety, Ellel ward has a bit of everything.
</p><p>

</p><p>
Let's start by climbing high.  On the northern boundary of Ellel ward lies Ward's Stone, at 561 metres the highest point in the Forest of Bowland.  To the south of Ward's Stone, at around half of this elevation, is the mountain pass of the Trough of Bowland which is the shortest, if not necessarily the most convenient, route from Lancaster to Clitheroe.  Although the Trough is less than ten miles from Lancaster, it once marked the boundary between Lancashire and Yorkshire: Bowland was transferred to Lancashire in the 1974 reorganisation.  The Lancashire side of the Trough is the sparsely-populated parish of Over Wyresdale, the whole of which is part of the Forest of Bowland Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.  And rightly so.
</p><p>
Next week marks the 38th anniversary of one of the greatest tragedies to hit this remote area.  On the evening of 23rd May 1984 the North West Water Authority put on a tour and presentation at the underground Abbeystead valve house, within Over Wyresdale parish, for 44 villagers of St Michael's on Wyre about ten miles downstream.  The Abbeystead scheme involved extracting water from the River Lune to the north and pumping it into the Wyre to improve the water supply for southern Lancashire, and the villagers were concerned that this was leading to flooding.  The water authority wanted to allay their concerns.  While the tour was going on the building exploded, due to a buildup of methane gas from coal seams below, and the concrete roof caved in on the people inside it.  Sixteen people died, including an 11-year-old boy and his mother.
</p><p>
The River Wyre runs south from here, but the ward runs west down to a much flatter landscape on the banks of the Lune estuary.  The Lune suffers a lot from silting, and at low tide there are extensive sands and mudflats at Cockerham.  The silt created problems for ships navigating up the estuary to Lancaster, and the city fathers decided to solve the problem by building a new port further downstream in the parish of Thurnham.  Thus was born Glasson Dock, which was built in the 1780s and connected to the nearby Lancaster Canal in the 1820s.  Some commercial traffic still uses Glasson Dock, but it never spawned a town of its own and the village of that name remains small.
</p><p>
The Lancaster Canal runs north-south between Glasson Dock and Bowland through the parish of Ellel.  Ellel itself is a very small place and the parish's main settlement is Galgate, a former textile village located on the A6 road running south towards Preston.  Galgate was the southern terminus of one of the UK's earliest motorways: the Lancaster bypass, now part of the M6, opened in 1960.
</p><p>
The 1960s also changed this area in another way. which we can see from Ellel ward's 2011 census return which is really not what you would expect for such a rural area.  The ward was slighly larger then, additionally taking in the parish of Scotforth Rural.  In 2011 Ellel was in the top 100 wards in England and Wales for full-time students (41%), those educated to A-level or equivalent but not (yet) further (31%), and the 18-29 age group (41%).  The reason for this is Lancaster University, which was also built here in the 1960s.  The main University campus forms a ward of its own on Lancaster council, but from the late 1990s it expanded to form a south-west campus which crossed the boundary into Ellel parish.   The south-west campus was removed from Ellel ward at a boundary change in 2015, but there are some Lancaster students and staff who choose to base themselves in Galgate which is only about half-an-hour's walk from the campus.  One of those Galgate students was Alan Milburn, a future Labour health secretary who read history at Lancaster in the late 1970s and who is now chancellor of Lancaster University.

</p><p>
The recent boundary changes may have reduced the university influence in Ellel ward - which was once significant enough for Labour to win a by-election here, back in July 1997 - but they haven't eliminated it.  We can see this from the 2019 Lancaster council result here, in which the Tory vote - which had been consistently over 50% this century - suddenly crashed.  The Conservatives still won both seats here but only with 42% of the vote, against 32% for Labour and 20% for the Green Party.
</p><p>
The Conservatives also lost ground in this area at the 2021 Lancashire county elections, contrary to what was happening elsewhere in the county.  Cockerham and Glasson Dock are part of the bizarrely-drawn Lancaster Central county division, which is a rare safe seat for the Green Party, while Ellel and Over Wyresdale parishes are in Lancaster Rural East which is safe Conservative but where the Tory vote dropped by over 10 points last year.  Lancaster Rural East's county councillor, Matthew Maxwell-Scott, subsequently failed in a bid to be elected to Lancaster council at a by-election in the neighbouring University and Scotforth Rural ward last November.
</p><p>
Lancaster council itself is normally hung and is currently very balanced.  Labour came close to winning overall control in 2015 but fell back at the 2019 election.  Following a number of later defections and by-election changes, Labour remain the largest group but with only 15 councillors plus a vacant seat, for which there will be a separate by-election in Morecambe in due course.  This vacancy means that the Conservatives, the Greens and the Morecambe Bay Independents are tied for runner-up status on 10 councillors each; there are also 4 councillors in the "Eco-Socialist Independent" group, most if not all of whom were elected on the Labour ticket; 5 other independents; and 4 Lib Dems.  The Greens and Eco-Socialist Independents are running the council as a minority administration.
</p><p>
The circumstances of the by-election are also rather difficult for the defending Conservatives.  The outgoing councillor is David Whitworth, who was in his first term on the council having been first elected in 2019; he lost his seat in March when he was disqualified for not turning up to any meetings of the council or its committees in six months.
</p><p>
Defending for the Conservatives is Janet Walton, a teacher who was the party's candidate for Lancaster Central in the county elections last year.  The Labour candidate is Ellel parish councillor Lisa Corkerry, who was runner-up here in 2019 and in Lancaster Rural East last year.  Standing for the Greens is Sally Maddocks, a Thurnham with Glasson parish councillor and former local government officer.  Robert Fildes completes the ballot paper for the Liberal Democrats.
