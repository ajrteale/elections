Five by-elections on 8th September 2022:

<h2>Foggy Furze</h2>

Hartlepool council, County Durham; caused by the resignation of independent councillor Stephen Picton.

So, the Boris Johnson era is over and we have a new Conservative leader who faces their first electoral test in today's five council by-elections.  There are four Conseravtive defences to come, but we'll start this week by travelling to the location of a contender for the most iconic electoral victory of the Johnson premiership.

Since May last year Hartlepool has had a Conservative MP, the first since Commander John "Yangtse Incident" Kerans in 1959-64.  That's a result of a convincing by-election win by Gill Mortimer, a rare by-election gain for the government from the opposition.

That wasn't the only poll going on here in May 2021.  In fact all of Hartlepool's elected representatives were up for election that year: the Tees Valley mayoralty (which saw the Conservatives' Ben Houchen re-elected), the Cleveland police and crime commissionership (another Conservative gain from Labour) and the whole of Hartlepool council, which was placed up for re-election on brand-new ward boundaries.

Hartlepool is a place which the Local Government Boundary Commission have been a frequent visitor to this century, but all ward maps for the town since 2004 have included a ward called Foggy Furze.  This intriguing name refers to "fog furrows", where "fog" is a Norse word for the coarse grass that grew here before Ralph Ward Jackson founded the town of West Hartlepool.  Foggy Furze ward lies south of the town centre, and in its current incarnation includes Stranton Cemetery.  Here can be found the war grave of Private Theophilus Jones, Durham Light Infantry, who was killed in the 1914 bombardment of Hartlepool by German warships; Jones was the first soldier killed on English soil by enemy action since the eighteenth century.

Like a lot of Hartlepool this is a very working-class area, and in this century Foggy Furze ward has usually voted Labour in council elections.  But not always.  In its first election in 2004 Foggy Furze split its representation between one Labour councillor and two Lib Dems.  One of the Lib Dems was re-elected in 2007, the other lost his seat to UKIP in 2008.  Labour gained those seats in 2011 and 2012 respectively, and continued to hold all three seats until in 2019.  In that year Hartlepool Labour split, their vote fell apart and Foggy Furze was won by the Veterans and People's Party, a minor player in the right-wing populist genepool.

For the 2021 elections Foggy Furze ward expanded west, mainly taking territory from the abolished Rift House ward.  The 2021 election resulted in a clearout here, as the two councillors elected as Labour stood down and the VPP councillor was defeated.  Top of the poll was a new face, independent candidate and community fundraiser Stephen Picton; the Conservatives' Kevin Tiplady finished close behind in second place, and then there was a big gap to independent candidate Darren Price who won the final seat with a majority of 81 votes over the lead Labour candidate.  Shares of the vote, for what they are worth given that the Conservatives only had one candidate, ware 30% each for the independents and Conservative, 20% for Labour and 14% for the Veterans and People's Party.  Darren Price had form in the previous Foggy Furze ward: he finished third in 2015 for the localist Putting Hartlepool First party, and was then a close second in 2016 (for UKIP) and 2018 (as an independent).

The 2021 Hartlepool council elections left the Conservatives as the largest party, with all 13 of their candidates elected.  This was nowhere near enough for a council majority, resulting a very balanced council with 13 Conservatives, 12 independents and/or localists and 11 Labour councillors, seven of whom scraped in third place for the final seat in their ward meaning that they would be up for re-election in May 2022.  The Conservatives had topped the poll in seven of Hartlepool's 12 wards in 2021, and a repeat of that this year would have given them six gains and a council majority.

Instead Hartlepool was the dog that didn't bark.  Labour were the clear winners of the 2022 Hartlepool elections, winning 7 of the 12 wards and finishing with no nett change.  The Conservatives did increase their seat count but fell well short of council control, while their independent coalition partners went backwards.  Immediately after the election the Tories then found themselves a man down after Gordon Cranney, re-elected as Conservative councillor for Seaton ward, pleaded guilty during the campaign to assaulting a woman; Cranney is now an independent councillor.  At the time of writing the Hartlepool council website lists 14 Conservatives and 12 Labour (or Labour and Co-operative) councillors.

Hartlepool Labour did lose one seat they were defending, in Fens and Greatham ward where their councillor Jennifer Elliott had been the subject of an Election Court case over false statements in her 2021 election leaflets.  The Court ruled that the false statements related to the political rather than the personal character of independent candidate Bob Buchan, who accordingly lost the court case but had the last laugh by defeating Elliott in the May 2022 election shortly afterwards.  That loss was offset for Labour by a gain here in Foggy Furze ward, where Labour took the seat previously held by independent councillor Darren Price.  Shares of the vote were 40% for Labour, 31% for Price and 25% for the Conservatives.

The ward's other independent councillor has now stood down after fifteen months in office.  Stephen Picton, who topped the poll here in 2021, has developed fibromyalgia and his health has now deteriorated to the point that he no longer feels he can continue as a councillor.  This column wishes him well for the future.

One independent candidate has come forward to replace Stephen Picton.  Connor Stallard contested the former Foggy Furze ward in 2019, finishing sixth out of seven candidates with 5% of the vote; he'll be hoping for better this time.  The Labour candidate is Carole Thompson, who stood in May in the Headland and Harbour ward covering Old Hartlepool; she is retired from an NHS career which included twe decades as an occupational therapist at Hartlepool General Hospital.  The Conservatives have selected Pamela Shurmer, who set up a campaign to install defibrillators in public places throughout Hartlepool after her son Danny died of a heart attack last year; as a result of that campaign Hartlepool reportedly has the country's highest number of defibrillators per head of population.  Completing the ballot paper is the Lib Dems' Barry McKinstray, who returns from May's election.

<h2>Warton</h2>

Lancaster council; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Adrian de la Mare.

lancaster-warton.png

For travellers from south to north along the West Coast routes - the M6 motorway or the railway main line, on the rare occasions that Avanti West Coast or Transpennine Express can be bothered to run trains - the scenery starts to change once you get past Lancaster.  The flat and rich countryside of the Fylde and Wyre suddenly gives way to significant hills, some of them craggy, as you pass into Cumbria.  However, the first of these hills is still in Lancashire.

This is Warton Crag, a prominent and steep limestone hill which overlooks Carnforth and Morecambe Bay.  Warton Crag packs a lot into its relatively low altitude of 413 feet.  The hill was quarried for its limestone for centuries, and is now noted for its variety of natural habitats: limestone grassland is rare in Lancashire, the old quarry is now a breeding-place for peregrine falcons, and the extensive saltmarshes below it on the western side of the crag support all sorts of other birdlife.  This includes the reed beds of Leighton Moss, which are maintained as a nature reserve by the RSPB.

Below the crag to the south-east is the ancient village of Warton, whose church - dedicated to St Oswald - goes back to time immemorial.  Warton was originally the main settlement in this corner of Lancashire, the nearby town of Carnforth being just a hamlet in the old Warton parish until it was chosen as the site for a railway junction in the nineteenth century.  The ancestors of George Washington, the first US president, lived in Warton in the fourteenth century, and local legend has it that Robert Washington - George's great-great-grandfather - helped to build the church's clocktower.  A US flag is hung inside the church, and flies from the tower every 4th July.

The Warton ward contains most of the current Warton parish (except the hamlet of Millhead, which is in a ward with Carnforth) together with the parish of Yealand Conyers to the north.  It has a fairly large retired population, with the beautiful countryside located not far at all from Carnforth and Lancaster beyond.  The current ward boundaries date from 2015 and both elections to date have returned Conservatives: in 2019 Adrian Duggan, as he then was, was returned with 47% of vote against 33% for the Green Party and 20% for Labour.  The Conservatives had a bigger lead in May 2021 across the Lancaster Rural North division of Lancashire county council, and also hold the local parliamentary seat of Morecambe and Lunesdale which has voted for the government at every election since its creation in 1983.

Lancaster council's politics are very difficult to follow, as this column has bemoaned on a regular basis over the last year.  The 2019 elections returned 21 Labour councillors, 14 Morecambe Bay Independents, 12 Conservatives, 10 Greens and 3 Lib Dems.  Since then the Morecambe Bay Independents have split and the Greens have joined forces with a number of defectors (particularly from Labour) in the newly rechristened "Green and Independent Group".  At the time of writing the council website lists 16 Labour councillors, 14 members of the Green and Independent group, 9 Conservatives, 6 Morecambe Bay Independents, and 4 councillors each in the Bay Independent Group, the Independent Group and the Lib Dems, with two vacant seats.  The leader of the council is Caroline Jackson of the Green and Independent Group, and her cabinet also includes Labour, MBI and Bay Independent councillors.  A gain for the Greens, who finished in a strong second place here in 2019, would be a boost for the council's ruling group.  A good showing for Labour will give a boost to their parliamentary ambitions in a key marginal seat.

There have been a lot of by-elections here.  Warton is the tenth by-election of the current term of Lancaster council, with an eleventh in the pipeline - and there's still a couple of months left to trigger more polls before the next Lancaster council is elected in May 2023.  The Conservatives have had to defend three previous by-elections in Lancaster over the last twelve months and lost the lot; a hold here might settle some nerves as the new Prime Minister finds his/her feet.

Also in 2023 we will get the final version of the next parliamentary boundaries, in which the Morecambe and Lunesdale seat will see major changes.  This is because the electorate of Cumbria is in an annoying range: too small to sustain that county's current six MPs, but too big for five.  Because of the geography of the North West region, the inevitable result of this will be a seat crossing the Lancashire-Cumbria boundary in the Warton area: the draft proposals from the Boundary Commission expand the Morecambe and Lunesdale seat into the Cumbrian countryside south of Kendal, with a name change to "Morecambe and South Lakeland".  This has the effect of splitting up the Westmorland and Lonsdale seat which has been held since 2005 by the former Lib Dem leader Tim Farron; about half of his current seat, including his electoral powerhouse of Kendal, ends up in a new Westmorland and Eden constituency which stretches north over Shap Fell to Penrith.  It seems most likely that Farron would attempt to seek re-election there, but should he instead decide to try his luck in Morecambe then the Lib Dems - who didn't stand in Warton ward in 2019 - had better take this by-election seriously.

So, while Warton might appear at first sight to be a safe Conservative ward - and it is - there's still a lot that can be read/spun into the result when it comes out.  Assuming that the spin is favourable for your side, of course.

Defending for the Conservatives is Iain Harbison, who last appeared in this column in December as the defending Conservative candidate in the Upper Lune Valley by-election (<em>Andrew's Previews 2021</em>, page 550); he had a very poor result there, convincingly losing a marginal seat to the Lib Dems.  Harbison is a registered nurse and a parish councillor in Yealand Redmayne, just to the north of this ward.  The Green candidate is Sue Tyldesley, a former senior officer for Sefton council who now sits on Yealand Conyers parish council; Tyldesley previously stood here in 2015.  Standing for Labour is Faith Kenrick, who also contested the Upper Lune Valley by-election last year.  Completing the ballot paper is Jane Parsons for the Lib Dems.

<h2>Felpham</h2>

West Sussex county council; and

<h2>Barnham</h2>

Arun council, West Sussex; both caused by the death of Conservative councillor John Charles.

<blockquote>
Away to sweet Felpham for heaven is there:
The Ladder of Angels descends through the air
On the turrett its spiral does softly descend
Through the village it winds, at my cot it does end.
</blockquote>

Not my words: this verse comes the pen  the eighteenth- and nineteenth-century poet William Blake, who lived from 1800 to 1803 in the Sussex village of Felpham.  His cottage in the village still stands although it was placed on Historic England's <em>Heritage at Risk</em> register last year.  It was here that Blake started work on his two-volume poem <em>Milton</em>, whose preface contains the poem we now as the hymn <em>Jerusalem</em>.

This corner of Sussex definitely fell into the category of "green and pleasant land" a couple of centuries ago, but Felpham's coastal location has led to a lot of housing being built here over the last two centuries.  The village is now effectively an eastern suburb of the town of Bognor Regis, and it might not be that inaccurate to describe its demographic as rather like that which took part in the Conservative leadership contest over the last two weeks.  Felpham's census return shows an old, white and Briitsh population with high levels of owner-occupation.

The developers haven't yet come in such a big way for Barnham, but there has been significant population growth here this century nonetheless.  A boundary review for the 2015 election dealt with this by lopping off the northern end of the previous Barnham ward, which means that the ward no longer contains the Fontwell Park racecourse.  We are left with a rural ward based on the villages of Aldingbourne, Westergate, Eastergate and Barnham itself.  Barnham is a railway junction, where trains taking the branch line to Bognor Regis leave Southern's West Coastway line.

As with the Redditch case last week, we have a county and district cuncillor who represented areas which border each other but do not overlap.  These polls arise following the death in July of councillor John Charles, who sat on both West Sussex county council and Arun district council, which covers the towns and villages on the coastal strip west of Worthing.  Charles had spent his working life with the Metropolitan Police, retiring after 30 years with the rank of detective inspector; a lifelong Conservative, he served on Horsham council from 1995 to 2003, had represented the Barnham ward of Arun council since 2011, and was in his first term on the county council after being elected for Felpham in 2021.

Felpham is a safe Conservative part of a strongly Conservative county, although the division did vote UKIP in 2013.  In 2021 John Charles won Felpham with 52% of the vote, against 20% for independent candidate Richard Parker and 10% for the Lib Dems.  The division's two Arun council wards have a full slate of four Conservative councillors.

Barnham ward is a bit more complicated.  Arun council was one of the few districts to stay Conservative throughout the party's 1990s collapse, but the Tories lost their majority on the council in 2019.  Despite polling fewer votes than the Conservatives, the Liberal Democrats came out on top with 22 seats against 21 Conservatives, 8 independents, 2 Greens and a Labour councillor.  A Lib Dem-led administration took over the council, but the Conservatives became the largest party again in May 2021 with two by-election gains from the Lib Dems, and the Tories have since taken back control with a minority administration.

Interestingly, one of the two Green gains in 2019 came in Barnham ward, which split its representation: the Conservatives topped the poll with 33% and held two seats, the single Green candidate polled 29% and won one seat, and the partial Lib Dem slate pollled 23%.  This column has covered a number of other cases and recent by-elections where the Green Party can poll particularly well in rural Sussex and neighbouring counties.  Remember what I said about there having been significant population growth in Barnham this century?

The ballot papers for both by-elections today give a strong impression of "progressive alliance" or "backroom deals", whatever you want to call it, with the Lib Dems not contesting either poll despite being the largest opposition party on both Arun council and West Sussex county council.  I'll start with the county by-election where the defending Conservative candidate is David Darling; he was an unsuccessful candidate for Arun council in 2019, fighting Orchard ward in Bognor.  Independent candidate Richard Parker is trying again after his second-place finish last year; another independent standing is Jaine Wild.  As stated, there is no Lib Dem candidate, so Labour's David Meagher - who was the Lib Dem candidate here back in 2013 - completes the county ballot paper.

For the district by-election the defending Conservative candidate is Graham Jones, who has retired from a career in the Army and the engineering industry where he worked on flight simulators.  In a newspaper interview with all the Barnham candidates (<a href="https://www.sussexexpress.co.uk/news/politics/here-are-the-candidates-for-the-barnham-by-election-3819345">link</a>) Jones describes himself as a former district and county councillor; I haven't been able to trace his district council career, but he was a UKIP member of West Sussex county council for Felpham from 2013 to 2017.  In the 2019 Arun elections Jones was an independent candidate for Middleton-on-Sea ward, where he lives.  The Greens have selected Barnham and Eastergate parish councillor Sue Wallsgrove, whose  previous career in local government was spent working on West Sussex county council's social services finance team.  Again there is no Lib Dem candidate, so the ballot paper is completed by Alan Butcher for Labour.
