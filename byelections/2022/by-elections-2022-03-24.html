There are four by-elections on 24th March 2022, but before considering those it's time to make a journey somewhere this column hasn't been for some time.  Welcome to the Square Mile...
</p><p>
<h2>City of London Corporation</h2>
</p><p>
As the COVID-19 pandemic fades into the background against a wall of immunity, it's now time to deal with the final electoral matters arising from it.  We kick off the 2022 local elections today with polling for the Common Council of the City of London Corporation.
</p><p>
<img alt="City of London" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/city-of-london-2022.webp" />
</p><p>
This Quaint British Tradition is a local government unit unlike any other in the UK.  The ancient City of London has had a huge amount of autonomy within England since time immemorial.  Nobody knows quite how long the City Corporation has been going, but one of the four surviving clauses of Magna Carta still provides that "the City of London shall have all the old Liberties and Customs which it hath been used to have".  Before that, a charter granted by Richard I in 1189 instituted the office of Lord Mayor of London, which is still going today.  Vincent Keaveny was installed in November 2021 as the 693rd Lord Mayor of London.
</p><p>
The City of London Corporation has been directly elected since the 14th century, and its unusually democratic nature (for the time) meant that it escaped the first major reorganisation of England's local government effected by the Municipal Corporations Act 1835.  It has similarly escaped every reorganisation since, confirming the City's status as a Quaint British Tradition.  The Corporation has all the powers of the modern-day London Boroughs which surround it, together with some more on top: it is responsible for the City of London Police, which remains independent of the Met.
</p><p>
These days the City of London is dominated by businesses and offices as the UK's most important financial centre.  The resident population here was well over 100,000 in centuries gone by, but is now down to around 10,000.  When business packs up for the day and the workers commute home, the streets of the City become very empty.
</p><p>
And it's businesses, rather than local residents, who hold the most clout in City elections.  Following reforms enacted by the Blair government and introduced in 2009, the Court of Common Council - the City's main representative body - has continued to have an electorate dominated by businesses.  It's not just residents who are eligible to vote here: sole traders working in the City have a vote, and companies and partnerships are eligible to nominate employees working in the City as voters.  The number of business voters dwarfs the local residents.
</p><p>
The 2009 reforms also introduced four-yearly elections for the Court of Common Council (which had previously been elected annually) and cut its membership to 100 Common Councilmen - a term which the City uses regardless of gender.  Four of the city's 25 ancient wards are designated as "residential" wards where most of the electors are local residents, and they elect 20 Common Councilmen between them.  The residential wards are Queenhithe (covering riverside apartments at the north end of the Millennium Bridge), Portsoken (a rather run-down area close to Aldgate on the City's eastern edge), and Aldersgate and Cripplegate (which together cover the modernist and rather exclusive Barbican estate).  The remaining 21 wards, returning 80 Common Councilmen, are dominated by business voters; indeed in some of those wards the number of resident voters is in single figures.
</p><p>
<img alt="City of London, 2017" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2017/city17s.svgz" />
</p><p>
City elections are traditionally fought on a non-partisan basis, and even figures who are prominent party politicians in other places will normally seek election to the Common Council as independent candidates.  The only major party which officially nominates candidates here is Labour, which won five seats at the last City elections in March 2017 and subsequently gained a seat at a by-election in Castle Baynard ward (<em>Andrew's Previews 2018</em>, page 348).  Those elections also saw a localist party stand here for the first time: "Temple and Farringdon Together" won all ten seats in Farringdon Without, the City's largest ward.  The other 84 seats are held by Common Councilmen who were returned as independents.
</p><p>
The pandemic restrictions of 2020-22 caused major problems for the City's franchise, because the work-from-home direction was incompatible with the qualifications for business voters.  As the Corporation was unable to compile a sensible register of voters, the City was forced to postpone the March 2021 Common Council elections by a year.  By-elections to the Common Council were also suspended, with the result that there are four vacant seats going into these elections.  Among those vacancies we should note the passing in June 2021 of Common Councilman Joyce Nash OBE, aged 92, who represented Aldersgate ward for 38 years.
</p><p>
The electoral process started yesterday with the holding of the Wardmotes, a general meeting of electors for each ward.  In six wards - Bishopsgate, Bridge and Bridge Without, Cheap, Cordwainer, Cornhill and Queenhithe - there will not be a contest due to insufficient candidates, so the wardmotes there have returned the 19 new Common Councilmen for those wards unopposed.
</p><p>
In the other 19 wards the wardmote functioned as a hustings for the poll, which will take place today from 8am to 8pm.  After this the count will take place in each ward, and the wardmote - after being adjourned yesterday - will resume for the declaration of the result.
</p><p>
The candidate list confirms that the non-party majority on the Court of Common Council will continue.  The Common Councilmen elected this week will serve a three-year term until March 2025, after which the City will go back to the previous four-year cycle.
</p><p>
These elections will not affect the Aldermen of the City, the 25 senior councillors (one for each ward) who are technically elected for life and from whom the Lord Mayors are chosen.  Aldermanic elections have been suspended during the pandemic, which means that a number of Aldermen have now gone past six years since their elections or the retirement age of 70, at which point they would normally be expected to retire or seek re-election.  There is also a vacancy after one Alderman died last year.  This suspension has now been lifted, so I expect that Andrew's Previews will cover a large number of Aldermanic elections in the near future.

<h2>Nethercourt</h2>
</p><p>
Thanet council, Kent; caused by the disqualification of Labour councillor Elizabeth Green.
</p><p>
As well as the City polls there are four local council by-elections taking place today, of which three are Labour and Liberal Democrat defences in the South East and the other is a Conservative defence in Northumberland.  We'll start with the Labour defence, by travelling to Kent.  Specifically, to Ramsgate.
</p><p>
<img alt="Thanet, Nethercourt" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/thanet-nethercourt.webp" />
</p><p>
The Nethercourt ward is the first part of Ramsgate that travellers see as they come into town from London.  Much of the ward consists of a 1960s estate, immediately under the eastern approach to the former Manston Airport, all of whose streets are named after bodies of water in the faraway Lake District.  There is older housing to the east of Nethercourt Hill and High Street St Lawrence.  The ward includes Southwood Stadium, which is home to the non-league football side Ramsgate FC.
</p><p>
This working-class ward has had unstable election results this century.  Nethercourt split its two seats between the Conservatives and Labour in 2003, then voted Conservative in 2007, Labour in 2011, UKIP in 2015 (the year Nigel Farage was trying to get elected as MP for the local South Thanet constituency) and Labour in 2019 on a rather low share of the vote: 39%, against 27% for the Conservatives and 19% for the Green Party.
</p><p>
<img alt="Thanet, 2019" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/thanet19s.svgz" />
</p><p>
This matches the instability of Thanet council as a whole.  The 2019 elections here left the council hung, and there have been two changes of administration in the three years since then.  The Conservatives, who deposed a Labour-led administration after gaining two by-elections in May 2021, currently run Thanet as a minority with 26 seats; there are 15 Labour councillors plus this vacancy, six councillors for the Thanet Independents (the main remnant of the majority UKIP group elected here in 2015), four independent and four Green Party councillors.  Nethercourt ward is part of the large Ramsgate division of Kent county council, which in 2021 (as in 2017) split its two seats between the Conservatives and Labour.
</p><p>
The Nethercourt by-election was caused by Labour councillor Liz Green failing to attend any meetings of the council in six months, which is an automatic disqualification.  She has cited concerns over COVID for not turning up to the council chamber.  Green had been involved in Thanet politics for many years, having sat on the council since 1999 with the exception of the 2015-19 term.  She was also one of the town's county councillors until 2013.
</p><p>
Defending this seat for Labour is local resident Anne-Marie Nixey, who is the chair of Ramsgate town council.  The Conservatives have selected John Davis, who is the founding chairman of a local pressure group, the Ramsgate Action Group.  The Greens have decided not to field a candidate this time, so the ballot paper is completed by Claire Tilbrook for the Thanet Independents.

<h2>Denne</h2>
</p><p>
Horsham council, West Sussex; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Frances Haugh.
</p><p>
<img alt="Horsham, Denne" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/horsham-denne.webp" />
</p><p>
There must be something in the water in Horsham.  Andrew's Previews has previously travelled to the town twice last autumn, for by-elections in Forest ward in October and in Roffey South ward in December.  And now we're back again.
</p><p>
For our third and final visit to Horsham of the current municipal year we have come to Denne ward.  This is Horsham's town centre, based around a series of shopping streets known as the Carfax.  South from the Carfax the Causeway runs to the parish church and the River Arun, while main roads radiate west to Guildford, east towards Brighton and north towards London.  As well as the usual services Horsham town centre has been the traditional administrative base for Sun Alliance Insurance, now part of the RSA Insurance
Group.  RSA's global headquarters are in the City of London (in the Walkie Talkie, which is part of Bridge and Bridge Without ward in today's City elections), but the company registered office of RSA Insurance Group is still in Horsham town centre.
</p><p>
<img alt="Horsham, 2019" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/horsham19s.svgz" />
</p><p>
Denne ward was expanded in boundary changes for the 2019 election, taking in the New Town area to the south-east of the town centre and going up from two councillors to three.  The previous ward had been marginal between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats befure turning safe Conservative in 2015, but the Lib Dems made a comeback here in 2019 to take all three seats in the revised Denne ward fairly comfortably.  Shares of the vote were 51% for the Lib Dems and 34% for the Conservatives.  The Liberal Democrats also hold the Horsham Riverside division which covers nearly all of this ward, and they made that division safe at the 2021 West Sussex county elections.
</p><p>
Defending for the Liberal Democrats is Clive Trott, who was a paper candidate for West Sussex county council last year (he contested Pound Hill division, in Crawley) but has a much better chance of winning this time.  The Conservatives have selected David Walbank, a former president of the Cambridge Union who made his career in the law: he is a QC with a formidable reputation as a technical lawyer.  Completing an all-male ballot paper are Kevin O'Sullivan for Labour (unusually for an O, he is top of the ballot) and Florian Yeates for the Green Party.

<h2>North Baddesley</h2>
</p><p>
Test Valley council, Hampshire; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Simon Cross.
</p><p>
<img alt="Test Valley, N Baddesley" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/test-vy-n-baddesley.webp" />
</p><p>
For our second Lib Dem defence of the week we travel west to Hampshire.  The village of North Baddesley can be found about six miles north of Southampton, midway between Eastleigh to the east and Romsey to the west.
</p><p>
North Baddesley is not a town, but strong population growth in the 20th century meant that by the 2001 census the parish had the population of a town with over 10,000 souls.  However, this is a little misleading: a large chunk of those people lived in the Valley Park development, a quasi-New Town on the edge of the Eastleigh/Chandler's Ford built-up area.  Valley Park declared independence and became a parish of its own in 2006, and accordingly the 2011 census recorded a fall in the population of North Baddesley parish to 6,823.  At the time the North Baddesley ward of Test Valley council had the same boundaries as the parish, but the ward expanded in 2019 to take in a corner of Valley Park.
</p><p>
This boundary change has had little effect on North Baddesley s political complexion.  The ward has voted Lib Dem at every election this century, and the 2019 Test Valley elections resulted in a 68-32 lead for the Lib Dem slate over the Conservatives.  The outgoing councillor Simon Cooper was first elected here in that 2019 election; he has stood down on health grounds.
</p><p>
<img alt="Test Valley, 2019" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/test-valley19s.svgz" />
</p><p>
The Liberal Democrats also hold the larger Baddesley division of Hampshire county council, increasing their majority in last year's county elections.  However, at Parliamentary level North Baddesley is part of the safe Conservative seat of Romsey and Southampton North: the local MP, Caroline Nokes, chairs the Women and Equalities Committee in the Commons.
</p><p>
Defending for the Liberal Democrats is Geoff Cooper, who is described by the party as a commercial manager for an international company with responsibilities across both UK and European markets.  He is the son of Mark Cooper, a long-serving district and county councillor who is the current Mayor of Test Valley.  The Conservatives have also chosen a candidate with family connections: George McMenemy, who self-deprecatingly describes himself on Twitter as "patriotic and eccentric" and "the world's worst cricketer", is a grandson of the legendary Southampton FC manager Lawrie McMenemy.  This by-election is a straight fight between the two.

<h2>Seghill with Seaton Delaval</h2>
</p><p>
Northumberland council; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Paul Scott.
</p><p>
<img alt="Northd, Seghill/Seaton Delaval" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/northd-seghill-seaton-delaval.webp" />
</p><p>
<blockquote>
Oh, Delaval is a terrible place,<br/>
They rub wet clay in the blackleg's face,<br/>
And around the heaps they run a foot race<br/>
To catch the blackleg miner.
</p><p>
So, divvint gaan near the Seghill mine,<br/>
Across the way they stretch a line<br/>
To catch the throat, to break the spine<br/>
Of the dirty blackleg miner.
</blockquote>
</p><p>
Like many good folk songs, <em>Blackleg Miner</em> has a story to tell.  It dates back to 1844, when a dispute between coal miners and mineowners resulted in a lockout of coal mines across Durham and Northumberland.  The lockout lasted for 20 weeks, but was eventually ended by the use of blacklegs - in other words, strikebreakers.
</p><p>
As you can see from the aggressive lyrics of <em>Blackleg Miner</em>, this didn't go down well in Seghill and Seaton Delaval, which are classic Northumberland pit villages just off the edge of the Tyneside built-up area.  Indeed, the villages get their post from over the metropolitan boundary in Whitley Bay, and part of the Seaton Villages parish which covers the area was administered from Whitley Bay until the 1970s.  However, the transport links to the Tyneside urban area aren't great.  The quasi-New Town of Cramlington lies just to the west, but these villages are located away from the main arterial roads; while the Blyth and Tyne railway, which passes through the ward, has carried only freight since the 1960s when the pits here closed.  Maybe that might change in future: Northumberland council have a plan to reopen this railway line to passengers, with a new station at Seaton Delaval to link the area to Newcastle, Bedlington and Ashington.
</p><p>
The name of Seaton Delaval goes back long before coalmining, though.  It refers to the Norman Delaval family, who came over here following the Norman conquest from the town of Laval in what was then the County of Maine.  Hubert de la Val is recorded as rebuilding Seaton's Saxon church in 1100.  The Delavals built a number of castles and buildings in the area culminating in Seaton Delaval Hall, an 18th-century stately home designed by John Vanbrugh.
</p><p>
A large part of Seaton Delaval Hall was destroyed in an 1822 fire and never fully rebuilt, and in the Second World War it was used as accommodation for prisoners of war,  So the place was in a bit of a state when it was inherited in 1956 by Edward Astley, the 22nd Lord Hastings, who was descended from the former Delaval family.  Hastings took an active part in the House of Lords, serving in the Conservative whips office and as a junior minister under Macmillan and Douglas-Home; he was also a major patron of the arts, and spent five decades on the restoration of Seaton Delaval Hall.  Edward died in 2007; his son Delaval Astley, the 23rd Lord Hastings, who previously voiced the villainous Cameron Fraser in <em>The Archers</em>, was unable to afford the death duties and consequently sold the hall to the National Trust.
</p><p>
Despite the late Lord Hastings' politics, until very recently this area has been a Labour stronghold.  Indeed Seaton Delaval was the political home of the former Labour MP Laura Pidcock, who grew up here; her father Bernard represented the former Seaton Delaval ward on Blyth Valley council until its abolition in 2009, and then he sat on Northumberland council for the neighbouring Holywell division until his death in 2019.  In 2013 long-serving Labour county councillor Margaret Richards was re-elected in Seghill with Seaton Delaval with a 73-16 lead over the Conservatives.
</p><p>
Four years later in May 2017, that Labour lead was cut to 49-42 as the Conservatives made huge gains in Northumberland and almost took overall control of the county council.  Seghill and Seaton Delaval is part of the Blyth Valley parliamentary seat, which was the first Conservative gain declared in the 2019 general election.  In May 2021 the Tories got over the line here, gaining Seghill and Seaton Delaval with a 54-46 lead over Labour; this was the gain the Conservatives needed to take overall control of Northumberland county council.
</p><p>
That Tory majority has since disappeared following the loss of a by-election to the Lib Dems in Hexham last December, and this could also be a tricky by-election for the party to defend if the change in the national polls since May 2021 is reflected here.  The Seghill with Seaton Delaval by-election follows the sudden death of the recently-elected Conservative councillor Paul Scott, who was just 46; Scott, who worked in the office of the local MP Ian Levy, was Northumberland council's deputy cabinet member for corporate services.
</p><p>
Defending for the Conservatives is Eve Chicken, who represents the ward on Seaton Valley parish council.  Labour have reselected Christine Savage, who was the losing candidate here ten months ago.  This by-election will not be a straight fight as two other candidates have come forward: they are Alisdair Gibbs-Barton for the Lib Dems and Clive Robson for the Green Party.
