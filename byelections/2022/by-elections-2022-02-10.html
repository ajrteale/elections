Before we start this week, I would like to correct a mistake which crept into the writeup for last week's Cotswold by-election.  The winning Conservative candidate Tom Stowe has not previously threatened legal action against the Lib Dem candidate Danny Loveridge.  The threat instead came from Tom's father Lynden Stowe.  Hopefully that's clear and I apologise to Tom Stowe for the error.

Three by-elections on 10th February 2022, all in the south of England and all in wards with some Liberal Democrat interest.  They will attempt to hold one seat this week, with the others being an independent and a Conservative defence.  Let's start with the Tory one:

<h2>Hailsham South</h2>

Wealden council, East Sussex; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Kevin Balsdon.

Our Conservative defence this week comes in the town of Hailsham.  Located around nine miles north of Eastbourne, Hailsham is an old town which was given a market charter in the thirteenth century by Henry III.  It's still a market centre for the local farmers, and the town's location on the edge of the Pevensey Levels means that there is a lot of prime agricultural land around here.  Recent decades have seen strong population growth and large amounts of housebuilding, and Hailsham is now one of the largest inland towns in East Sussex.  It is the home of Wealden district council, to which it returns six councillors.  The South ward of Hailsham lies along the main road towards Eastbourne, which much of its housing dating from the 1990s.

Mention of Hailsham might bring to mind for older readers of this column a mental image of Quintin Hogg, Lord Hailsham, who was one of the contenders for Prime Minister after Harold Macmillan's health failed in 1963, and served as Lord Chancellor for the first two terms of the Thatcher government.  Quintin's disclaimed title of Viscount Hailsham has now passed to his son Douglas Hogg, who was a hapless agriculture minister during the BSE crisis at the tailend of the Major government but is probably now better remembered for having his moat cleaned on parliamentary expenses.

Like Quintin and Douglas, Hailsham South is a Conservative place these days.  The present Hailsham South ward was created at a boundary review in 2019 from part of the previous Hailsham South and West ward.  That ward had returned an independent slate in 2003 and 2007, but was gained by the Conservatives in 2011.

The present Hailsham South ward re-elected outgoing Tory councillor Chriss Triandafyllou in 2019 with 47% of the vote, against 29% for the Lib Dems and 25% for Labour.  Triandafyllou subsequently died in March 2020, having suffered a heart attack while being treated in hospital for a broken leg.  Ironically, his campaigning had led to a number of public defibrillators being installed in Hailsham in 2016.

The pandemic meant that Triandafyllou's seat remained vacant for over a year before a by-election could finally be held in May 2021.  This was generally a good set of local elections for the Conservatives, but in Hailsham South the withdrawal of Labour led to a sharp swing to the Liberal Democrats.  New Tory councillor Kevin Balsdon won the by-election with a 45-36 lead in what is now clearly a marginal ward.  On the same day the Conservatives held the local county council division (Hailsham New Town) with a larger majority than that.

Kevin Balsdon has resigned from Wealden council after just a few months in office, forcing the second Hailsham South by-election in nine months.  Defending for the Conservatives this time is Hailsham town councillor Chris Bryant, who contested another Wealden council by-election in Hailsham North last May and lost the seat to the Liberal Democrats.  That party have reselected former town councillor Anne Blake-Coggins, who has previously fought the ward in 2019, the May 2021 Wealden council by-election and a December 2021 town council by-election.  Completing the ballot paper is Stephen Gander in a rare local election outing for the Social Democratic Party.

<h2>Eastleigh Central</h2>

Eastleigh council, Hampshire; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Jephthe Doguie.

We travel west along the south coast to Eastleigh.  Hailsham has no railway station these days, but Eastleigh was made by the railways.  In the nineteenth century it became home to the carriage works of the London and South Western Railways, and in 1909 the railway's locomotive works were transferred here from Nine Elms in London.  Eastleigh railway station is still a major junction on the London-Southampton line, with trains branching off here towards Fareham and Salisbury.

It says something for how new Eastleigh town is that history records who named it.  The railway station opened in 1838 with the name of Bishopstoke Junction, in a rural area near the village of Barton.  Barton parish merged in 1868 with the neighbouring parish of Eastley, and a local celebrity donated Â£500 towards the construction of a new parish church.  She was Charlotte Yonge, a novelist who was well-regarded in Victorian times but is rather forgotten now.  In exchange for her donation Yonge was asked to choose whether the new parish should take Barton or Eastley's name; she went for the latter, but with a new spelling.  Thus Eastleigh was born.

In its shortish life the town of Eastleigh has given us characters as diverse as the BBC radio presenter Scott Mills, the naked rambler Stephen Gough and Chrystabel Leighton-Porter, who was the model for the <em>Jane</em> comic strip during the Second World War.  Given the presence of the last two, perhaps it's appropriate that this area is also associated with Benny Hill, whose early job as a milkman in Eastleigh inspired the 1971 Christmas Number One.  Ladies and gentlemen, I bring you the modern pop classic which is <em>Ernie (The Fastest Milkman in the West)</em>.

The modern Eastleigh Central ward takes in the railway station, the town centre and part of the railway works, which are still going but are much less busier than they used to be.  In the 2011 census, on slightly different boundaries to those of today, it had the largest non-white population and the lowest owner-occupation rate in the Eastleigh district, which takes in a number of affluent suburbs on the eastern side of Southampton.

The Eastleigh parliamentary seat has been Conservative-held since 2015, when they gained it from the Lib Dems who had won a 1994 by-election.  One of its previous MPs was the Coalition cabinet member Chris Huhne, who can testify that lying to get yourself off a fixed penalty notice can have consequences.  Eastleigh council, which covers a slightly larger area than the constituency, has been run for many years by the Liberal Democrats: Keith House is now one of the longest-serving council leaders in the UK, having been in office since 1994.

Eastleigh Central ward is part of that majority, although it did return a Labour councillor as recently as 2002.  The May 2021 elections in this ward saw Labour make a comeback after a poor result in 2019: shares of the vote were 37% for the Lib Dems which was down sharply on two years previously, 29% for Labour and 25% for the Conservatives.  On the same day the Hampshire county council elections were held: this ward is split between the Eastleigh North and Eastleigh South divisions, which were both Lib Dem-Conservative marginals last year.

Why this sudden fall in Lib Dem support?  Well, outgoing councillor Jephthie Doguie - now there's a name to conjure with - was first elected for this ward in 2018, when the current ward boundaries were introduced.  At the time of his first election, he was the youngest member of Eastleigh council; at the time of his resignation, he was the only black member of that council, although unlike the row this column covered in Ancoats and Beswick last week there's no suggestion that race is a factor here.  Doguie was re-elected for a four-year term in 2019 meaning that the winner of this by-election will serve for 15 months.  His resignation was prompted by a move away from the area, but there is clearly more to it than just that.

Doguie had found himself on the wrong side of a planning row over an extension to the Southampton Airport runway, in which the Eastleigh area committee (which had voted to reject) was overruled by the full council.  That row led to the resignation from the party of Eastleigh Central ward councillor Tina Campbell, who has joined the council's independent group.  She is up for re-election in May.  Judging from his resignation statement, Doguie is clearly not happy with the Lib Dem leadership either; he has gone so far as to endorse the Labour candidate in this by-election.

So, this should be fun to watch.  Defending for the Lib Dems is Bhavin Dedhia, a local resident who is a dentist with a practice in Southampton.  Labour have reselected their regular candidate Josh Constable, a local resident who works in financial analytics for the NHS and was the runner-up here in the last three Eastleigh council elections.  Standing for the Conservatives is Simon Payne, who is an analyst for a major DIY retailer; he finished second in a by-election to the previous Eastleigh Central ward in May 2017 (<em>Andrew's Previews 2017</em>, page 117).  Completing the ballot paper are Clare Fawcett for Reform UK and the Greens' Jack Stapleton, who gives an address in the ward on Benny Hill Close.  <a href="https://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/5585965.benny-hills-no-joke/">No, I am not making that up.</a>  The local press have profiled all the candidates and you can find out more here (<a hre=f"">link</a>).

<h2>Alcombe</h2>

Somerset West and Taunton council; caused by the disqualification of independent councillor Paul Bolton, who failed to attend any meetings of the council in six months.

As has happened on a number of occasions in the last nine months, we finish an edition of Andrew's Previews with a trip to Somerset West and Taunton council.  That district was only created in 2019, but this is already the seventh by-election which has been held to it; and it looks like the council will have a very short life, with abolition on the cards in 2023.

Alcombe ward lies in the Somerset West part of the council.  This is the south-eastern of four wards covering the town of Minehead, and is essentially a village which the town's growth has swallowed up.  Minehead has a coastal location at the foot of the Exmoor uplands - its name is cognate with <em>mynydd</em>, the Welsh word for "mountains" - and parts of Alcombe ward lie within the Exmoor National Park.  The town proper is is a seaside resort with low-paid jobs and all that implies.

This area has very similar boundaries to the Alcombe ward of the predecessor West Somerset council.  The former Alcombe ward was the scene of the last by-election to that council in June 2018, and as this column described then (<em>Andrew's Previews 2018</em>, page 213) its local elections in recent years have been all over the place.  In 2011 it returned an independent and a Conservative councillor; in 2015 it split its seats between a different Conservative councillor and UKIP.  The UKIP councillor resigned in 2018 and the resulting by-election went to the Liberal Democrats.

At the time the 2018 column was written it looked like the 2019 elections for Somerset West and Taunton council were going to use the county council division boundaries.  This area is part of the Dunster county division, which was safely Conservative the last time it was contested in May 2017.  However, the Local Government Boundary Commission were able to get a new ward map drawn up which preserved Alcombe ward, albeit with a slight boundary change and a reduction from two councillors to one.  The ward's Lib Dem councillor Nicole Hawkins sought election to the new council in 2019, but narrowly lost to independent candidate Paul Bolton.  Shares of the vote were 36% for Bolton, 33% for the Lib Dems and 19% for the Conservatives.  Despite that setback, the Lib Dems rather unexpectedly won a small majority on the new council and have defended it in a number of resulting by-elections.

Paul Bolton is the Mayor of Minehead for 2021-22 and would appear to have been taking an active role in civic life, so this is not obviously a case where illness has been a factor in his not attending meetings of Somerset West and Taunton council.  He had attracted some controversy in his short time of office, with a local pressure group revealing in June 2021 that Bolton was in arrears with his council tax.  This can have consequences: councillors who are in council tax arrears aren't allowed to vote on the council's budget.

There is one independent candidate looking to succeed Bolton in this by-election.  Richard Lillis is a former Conservative member of West Somerset council; in 2019 he contested the neighbouring Old Cleeve and District ward as an independent, and he was back as an independent candidate in a by-election in June 2021.  On that occasion he polled 120 votes, and probably cost the Conservatives the chance of gaining the seat from the Lib Dems who held the by-election with a majority of just six votes.  The Lib Dems have reselected Nicole Hawkins who was the winner of the 2018 by-election here.  The official Conservative candidate is Craig Coleman.  Completing the ballot paper is Shanti Roos for Labour.
