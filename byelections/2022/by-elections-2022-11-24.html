One by-election on Wednesday 23rd November 2022:

<h2>Hucknall Central</h2>

Ashfield council, Nottinghamshire; caused by the death of Ashfield Independents councillor Jim Blagden.

One of your columnist's guilty pleasures is the music of Eric Coates, one of the greatest of English light music composers.  Coates entered this world in 1886 as the son of a GP in a town which was then called Hucknall Torkard, and had a rather middle-class upbringing in what was alraedy then a rather industrial town, before leaving Nottinghamshire to find fame and fortune by playing the viola.  It's a life story not that unlike that of another great Nottinghamshire man we discussed in this column twenty days ago, D H Lawrence.

But Coates is not the most famous person associated with Hucknall (the "Torkard" suffix seems to have fallen down the back of the settee at some point in the past).  Next to the town's market square, at the top of the High Street, is a mediaeval church dedicated to St Mary Magdalene.  This church is the final resting place of generations of the Byron family, including the poet Lord Byron and his daughter Ada Lovelace, who is often credited as the first computer programmer.

Among Lord Byron's many works was a long-standing interest in Armenian culture and history; he learnt the Armenian language from monks in Venice, and wrote or co-wrote a number of English-Armenian textbooks and dictionaries.  This connection hasn't been forgotten.  Following the Armenian earthquake of 1988, the British government provided funds to rebuild a school in Armenia's second-largest city, Gyumri; the school was reopened by Margaret Thatcher in June 1990, and renamed after Lord Byron.  The Lord Byron School have returned the favour by sending a carved stone cross, a <em>khatchkar</em>, to Hucknall's secondary school (now called the Holgate Academy).  Unfortunately, this <em>khatchkar</em> was damaged by vandals in 2000, and has been removed to St Mary Magdalene church; the Armenians have, however, sent a replacement to the school.

Byron also once have his name to the town's railway station on the Nottingham-Mansfield railway line, which was reopened in 1993.  Hucknall station has had its communications greatly improved in 2004 by the opening of the Nottingham tram network, of which this is the northern terminus; up to eight trams an hour now link Hucknall to Nottingham city centre.  Despite this, the 2011 census return for Hucknall Central ward doesn't show a commuter demographic; changes to the ward boundary in 2015 are unlikely to have changed that.  This is a working-class area.

However, even taking that into account it's important to understand that the politics of Hucknall is not simply red.  We are in the Ashfield local government, where politics has never been quite the same since the rise in the late 2000s of Jason Zadrozny.  In 2007 Zadrozny became the youngest council leader in the country, aged just 26, at the head of a Liberal Democrat-led administration of Ashfield council.  He was the Lib Dem candidate for the Ashfield parliamentary seat in 2010, and lost to Labour by just 192 votes.

Despite the general collapse of the Liberal Democrats in May 2015 and the fact that Labour had regained an overall majority on Ashfield council in 2011, the local Lib Dems were confident of gaining the Ashfield parliamentary seat right up to the point where Zadrozny was arrested, shortly before the close of nominations, on suspicion of historic child sex offences.  The Lib Dems dropped him.  Zadrozny was re-elected to Ashfield council, but that year's council elections resulted in a Labour majority on the council.

The case against Zadrozny eventually came to trial in November 2017, at which point the prosecution offered no evidence and he was acquitted of all charges.  With no sign of readmittance to the Lib Dems forthcomting, Zadrozny was reduced to forming his own party to try and get back.  This he did, with stunning success.  Even before the trial, the Ashfield Independents had gained Hucknall North ward in an October 2017 by-election after Ben Bradley, the outgoing Conservative councillor, was elected to Parliament as MP for Mansfield (<em>Andrew's Previews 2017</em>, page 291).  Following Zadrozny's acquittal, the ruling Labour group on Ashfield council split and a large number of councillors flocked to the Zadroznyite banner; in April 2018 he was reinstalled as council leader.  In December 2018 the Zadroznyites won a by-election in the Sutton Common and Harlow Wood ward with 82% of the vote (<em>Andrew's Previews 2018</em>, page 457).

It was obvious that the Ashfield Independents were going to win the 2019 district elections and win big.  Once all the votes were counted the party had secured 67% of the vote across the district, winning 30 seats out of a possible 35.  The seats that got away were in Hucknall South ward (which voted Labour) and Hucknall West (Conservative); most of the other wards were over 70% Zadroznyite, in some cases over 80%.  Jason Zadrozny stood for parliament again in December 2019, finishing second in the Ashfield constituency as it was gained by the Conservatives.

To date, elections here since 2019 show no sign of the Zadroznyite surge breaking down.  In the Nottinghamshire county council elections the Ashfield Independents won all ten county council seats in Ashfield district, including the Hucknall South division which covers this ward.  At a by-election earlier this month the Conservatives lost their only county council seat within the Ashfield constituency, in Eastwood.

Now Hucknall is a bit out on a limb within the Ashfield district, which is based on the towns of Sutton-in-Ashfield and Kirkby-in-Ashfield to the north.  It's not part of the Ashfield parliamentary seat, instead being included within the Sherwood constituency represented by Mark Spencer.  Spencer was a Cabinet minister throughout the Johnson premiership, serving as chief whip for most of that period; he was demoted by Liz Truss to a junior ministerial position in the agriculture department, and Rishi Sunak has kept him there.

It will be seen that Hucknall is possibly the weakest part of the district for the Zadroznyites.  Hucknall Central ward is entirely built-up, but the countryside around the town is slated for lots of new housing and that proposal has generated the usual level of disquiet.

There's also the Big Plot Twist to consider.  In a development worthy of any TV scriptwriter, Jason Zadrozny and five other Ashfield Independent councillors were arrested last week by Nottinghamshire Police.  They suspect Zadrozny of fraud, money-laundering and misconduct in public office, with some of the other councillors also under suspicion of perverting the course of justice and electoral offences.  All six councillors deny any wrongdoing, and the police investigation continues.

This might not help the Zadroznyites in the defence of a by-election today in their most marginal ward, Hucknall Central.  This follows the death of councillor Jim Blagden, who succumbed to cancer on 31st July at the age of 74.  Blagden had led the council's response to the COVID-19 pandemic during his three years on the council; before entering politics he had worked as a master bricklayer and school caretaker.  In 2019 he was elected on the Ashfield Independent slate with just 37% of the vote, ahead of Labour on 30% and the Conservatives on 19%.

Defending for the Ashfield Independents is Nick Parvin, who is a care worker studying for a master's degree.  Labour have reselected John Wilkinson who was runner-up here in 2019; he has previously served as a county councillor for Hucknall.  The Conservative candidate is Jan Lees, who is described as a well-known community champion.  Those are your three candidates.

Four by-elections on Thursday 24th November 2022.  However, before getting to them I need to address something which has been kindly pointed out to me by a correspondent.  I apologise for having to interrupt your weekly reading to do this, but it is important.

Last year your columnist gave an interview to Politico about the work I do here and with the Local Elections Archive Project.  The inevitable question inevitably came up: why do you write this stuff about such an obscure subject, local elections?

Well, one part of the attraction is that almost nobody else is writing about local politics on a regular basis.  Look at the teams of reporters and journalists who hang around Westminster analysing every word which is declaimed in Parliament or which leaks from the top of the ship of state.   Now compare and contrast with the teams of reporters and journalists who are doing the same thing for your local council.  Alright, "team" might be a little optimistic there.  But your council has a lot of control over your local services with tax-raising and enforcement powers to match.  What your local politicians do needs taking seriously.

Instead of hundreds of journalists all chasing the same story, this column gives you one person chasing hundreds of stories.  There's literally something different every week, and I think that after twelve years of writing this stuff I have proved the point that there is no such thing as an uninteresting by-election.

Now if somebody wants to go and write about the same polls from a different angle, that's entirely their prerogative.  Imitation, so they say, is the sincerest form of flattery.  But there's a fine line between imitation and plagiarism, and I regret to say that a correspondent has kindly informed me of something which crosses that line.

Until further notice Andrew's Previews is definitively published at medium.com/britainelects.  Do feel free to put that address in your bookmarks, email subscription, RSS reader, whatever method you prefer to keep up-to-date every Thursday.

Now let me take you to https://medium.com/@greenselectltd, run by a Medium account with the name "Green Elects".  What you will find here is a collection of bits which would appear to have been copied and pasted from the Previews, but only the bits therefrom which involve Green Party candidates.  And when I say "copied and pasted", this includes my typing errors.  There's basically zero original thought there, just a brazen attempt to pass off my own work as somebody else's.

Longtime readers will be aware that every year the Previews are collected up and republished in book form.  <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Andrews-Previews-2021-parliamentary-elections/dp/1999834550/"><em>Andrew's Previews 2021</em></a> is available right now for your reading pleasure and will make an excellent Christmas present for the discerning psephologist of your acquaintance.  These books are an important way of making money to support the Previews and for the Local Elections Archive Project, which is why they get plugged at the end of every week's piece.

In due course the Previews for this year are going to get collected up and republished in book form, in a similar way to what has happened in the previous six years.  I have four ISBN numbers left, and given the amount of money I paid for them I intend to use them.

Publishers are rightly aware of the dangers of plagiarism and copyright.  My book printers are aware that I write the Previews and I hold the copyright in them.  If were my work to appear under somebody else's name, that would make it more difficult to prove that I have the copyright in the Previews and thus jeapordise one of my sources of income.

My correspondent has already tried to tell "Green Elects" off on my behalf in private, and got nowhere.  So, "Green Elects", whoever you are, you can consider this a telling off in public.  If you want to write about local by-elections under your name, <b>do it in your own words, not mine</b>.

Here endeth the rant.

We now return to your normal weekly viewing by travelling to Warriungton...

<h2>Rixton and Woolston</h2>

Warrington council, Cheshire; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Joshua Dixon.

There's a bit of a north-western bias to the Previews at the moment.  We had three council by-elections in Lancashire last week, there are one-and-a-bit such this week, and next week we have parliamentary by-elections to come in the City of Chester and in Stretford and Urmston.

I say one-and-a-bit because of the presence of Rixton and Woolston.  This is one of the few wards which contains territory from both sides of the River Mersey, the traditional boundary between Lancashire and Cheshire.  However, the south side of the Mersey here is unpopulated, and the meandering old river has been superseded as a boundary by the Manchester Ship Canal, which forms the southern boundary of this ward.

There are only two ways south from here, both of which involve bridges high enough for ships to pass underneath.  One is to take the motorway over the Thelwall Viaducts, which are a landmark on the M6.  The original viaduct, which now carries the northbound carriageway, was when it opened in 1963 the longest motorway bridge in England.  The other crossing is the Warburton Toll Bridge, one of a handful of pre-motorway toll bridges remaining in the UK; the tolls here were set by the Rixton and Warburton Bridge Act 1863 at half-a-crown "for every Carriage drawn or propelled by Steam or any Means other than Animal Power".  Now decimalised at 12p per crossing or 25p for a return trip, the tolls have remained unchanged for well over a century - until now.  The Manchester Ship Canal Company, which now owns the bridge, is seeking to increase the toll charge to £1 per crossing, an inflation-busting increase even in these days of cost-of-living crisis.  A public inquiry into this proposal is currently under way.

The Warburton Toll Bridge is possibly the least-used crossing of the Ship Canal, carrying a minor road in a rural location some distance to the east of Warrington.  Its access road comes to an end at a set of traffic lights on the A57 road linking Warrington with the city of Salford to the east.  This junction is within the parish of Rixton-with-Glazebrook.  Despite the ward and parish name there's no real village of any size called Rixton, but Glazebrook is home to the ward's railhead on the Manchester to Warrington Central line.

Instead Woolston is the main component of this ward.  This is suburbia on the eastern edge of Warrington which is not really New Town development at all; the ward has a high owner-occupation rate.  Your columnist used to visit here fairly often, as the UK quiz circuit once had a regular venue at Woolston Rovers rugby league club.

Rixton and Woolston have together formed a ward of Warrington for many years.  It's generally a Labour-voting area, but the Conservatives performed very well here in the 2021 local elections to win a seat here for the first time since 2004.  Shares of the vote here last year were 40% for the Conservatives who won two seats, 37% for Labour who held one seat, and 13% for an independent candidate.  One of the Labour candidates who lost out was Faisal Rashid, who sat in Parliament from 2017 to 2019 as the Labour MP for Warrington South; Rixton and Woolston, however, is within the Labour-held but marginal parliamentary seat of Warrington North.

Labour have a majority on Warrington council, which has a page on its website with the unapologetic but concerning title of "Our debt position".  As of March 2022 the council was in debt to the tune of £1.7 billion, having used that money to make investments in assets and property.  The council has used the resulting rental income to fund its statutory services.  This might prove to be a more sustainable investment approach than that taken by Thurrock council, which has had the Commissioners sent in after its loans went sour; but in these days of higher interest dates and renewed austerity it remains to be seen whether Warrington can continue to service this level of debt in future.

In the meantime the Cosnervatives have the tricky task, judging from the downturn in their national polling position since 2021, of holding a by-election in Rixton and Woolston ward following the resigation of councillor Joshua Dixon.  A change in Dixon's work commitments meant he was unable to continue as a councillor, and when all's said and done a councillor allowance is no substitute for a full-time salary.

Defending for the Conservatives is Rob Tynan, a Woolston parish councillor who was their unsuccessful candidate here last year.  The Labour candidate is Trish Cockayne, who is described as an anti-poverty campaigner.  The independent candidate from last time has not returned, so Brian Meichen completes the candidate list for the Lib Dems.

<h2>Linacre</h2>

Sefton council, Merseyside; caused by the death of Labour councillor Gordon Friel.

The River Mersey links together two of our by-elections today.  It might be a fairly narrow channel at Woolston, but by the time we get to Bootle this has changed.  This is the point where the Mersey estuary reaches the wide-open spaces of the Irish Sea.  In these times of the FIFA World Cup, let's do what many football fans will be doing for the next few weeks and cross over to Linacre.

Linacre ward is the heart of Bootle; indeed Bootle town hall still bears the town's older name of "Bootle-cum-Linacre" on its Victorian stonework.  Bootle's economy was completely dependent on the docklands of Liverpool, which by the end of the nineteenth century extended all the way along the town's riverfront.  This gave Bootle enough economic clout to successfully fight off a number of attempts to incorporate it into the big city, even through it's difficult for any non-local to know where Liverpool ends and Bootle begins.

The centenary of Bootle's incorporation as a borough, in 1968, was marked by the opening of the New Strand shopping centre, next to Bootle New Strand station on the Merseyrail Northern Line.  Notorious as the location from which the toddler James Bulger was abducted in 1993, the New Strand has had a few redevelopments over the years.  It was bought by Sefton council in 2017.  The town hall is served by another Northern Line station, Bootle Oriel Road.

The docks are still important today.  Here can be found the Seaforth Dock, a modern container terminal at the end of the East Lancashire Road whose cranes dominate the landscape.  To the south of this is Gladstone Dock, from which regular ferries arrive and depart bound for Dublin.

All of this dockland and the surrounding area was heavily bombed in the Second World War, and after that the docks went into a decline resulting in high unemployment.  The 2011 census return for Linacre ward shows that this is a still a problem: Linacre made the top 100 wards in England and Wales for long-term sickness or disability (13.9%), unemployment (10.4%) and social renting (49.2% of households).

This column has made a number of trips to Liverpool over the last 18 months to cover local by-elections which have been rather lacklustre for Labour.  However, Bootle is part of the Sefton local government district which stretches up the coast as far Southport; this district has been swinging to Labour throughout the last decade, to the extent that the Southport parliamentary seat - once a Lib Dem stronghold - is now looking like a realistic Labour target.

In Bootle the Labour vote is not counted but weighed, and in May this year Labour polled 76% of the vote in Linacre ward against independent and Conservative opposition.  One of the opposition candidates who tried and failed to break through here was the former UKIP leader Paul Nuttall, who at the time was an MEP for north-west England.  Nuttall stood in this ward in 2010, coming third with 12%; on the same day he also saved his deposit as UKIP candidate for the local Bootle constituency.  Three years earlier Labour were opposed in Linacre ward only by the Communist Party, who lost 86-14; that's a rather better score than the average Communist Party candidate gets in Britain.

The winning Labour candidate here in 2010 and in May was veteran councillor Gordon Friel,
who passed away in July at the age of 69 just two months into his tenth term of office.  Friel had represented Linacre ward continuously since 1994.  He had got into politics as a union convenor at the Jacobs biscuit factory in Aintree; in recent years Friel's political activities had been focused on transport, as he sat on the transport committee for Merseytravel and the Liverpool city region.

Big shoes to fill for the defending Labour candidate Dan McKee, who contested Birkdale ward at the other end of Sefton district in May.  In a straight fight he is opposed only by independent candidate Ian Smith.
