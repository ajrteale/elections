<h2>Sir David Butler 1924-2022</h2>

<blockquote>
RICHARD DIMBLEBY: And you, David Butler, are a psephologist.  What does it mean?

DAVID BUTLER: It means a student of elections.  I'm afraid that it's an awful, silly academic joke which somebody else perpetrated and I put in print about eight years ago which now hangs like an albatross around my neck...
</blockquote>

This week the world of political science mourns one of its giants.  Sir David Butler, who passed away on Tuesday at the age of 98, is justifiably described as the father of psephology.  There's very little in the modern science of elections which doesn't trace back to Butler in some form: most notably the swingometer, which has entertained UK election night viewers for decades.  We may have moved on from a wooden arrow on a nail to a computer-generated graphic, but the principle of the swingometer is still largely unchanged from the 1950s even if politics isn't.

In his day job as an academic Butler's work includes the Nuffield series of election studies, which has brought us a book on every UK general election since 1945.  15 of those books - covering the period 1951 to 2005 - were written or co-written by Butler.  And Butler also taught the next generation, and the generation after that, of political students at Oxford.  Even in his 90s, he was discovering new ways of talking about elections by sharing his thoughts and facts on the 2017 general election through the medium of Twitter.

This column often marks the passing of political veterans, but none of them match the length of service of Sir David Butler.  We will miss him, but we can also reflect on a long life well lived, and be grateful for on the knowledge, experience and time he gave to others.  And his lasting legacy will be that the science he founded - psephology - lives on.

<em>Requiescat in pace.</em>

<h2>Matters arising</h2>

We have now reached the second week of November, and long-term readers of Andrew's Previews should know from those words what is coming next.  It is time for me to mount the pulpit and read out the following notice.

The six-month rule is now in effect ahead of the next ordinary English local elections, which will take place on Thursday 4th May 2023.  This is the largest year of the English local electoral cycle, with the majority of the shire district councillors up for election alongside a third of those councils which hold elections by thirds.  There will also be local elections for the 11 councils in Northern Ireland, but nothing is scheduled for London, Scotland or Wales.

If any new vacancies arise from now for council seats which have less than six months left of their term, then there will not be a by-election and those seats will be left vacant until next May.  This doesn't apply to seats with less than six months left which are already vacant, and you will see a number of these crop up in this column both below and over the next few weeks.  However, because 2023 is a big local election set this column will be rather quieter than usual over the coming winter and spring.

In England and Wales, councillors' terms normally start on the fourth day after their election, which is the Monday after polling.  We have now had the announcement that Monday 8th May 2023 will be a special bank holiday to mark the Coronation of Charles III.  Returning officers will breathe a sigh of relief that the previous Friday has not been chosen as a bank holiday, as that would have messed up a lot of count arrangements.

Before then we have a slightly unexpected by-election result to bring to you from Norfolk.  The late John Collop was until a couple of years ago the leader of the Labour group on King's Lynn and West Norfolk council; he was first elected to that council in 1999, although he missed the 2007-11 term.  Collop passed away in August at the age of 70, creating a vacancy in the <b>Gaywood Clock</b> ward of King's Lynn.  A by-election had been scheduled for 1st December to fill this seat, but when nominations closed Alex Ware of the Labour Party was the only candidate: accordingly Ware has been declared elected unopposed.  This column sends its congratulations to Councillor Ware.  Had the Gaywood Clock poll gone ahead it would have been combined with another by-election to Norfolk county council, which the Conservatives are defending; this column will be in King's Lynn on 1st December to cover that.

In the meantime we have nine by-elections on 10th November 2022, six of which are Conservative defences in England.  There is also a Lib Dem defence in London, an independent defence in Essex and a free-for-all in Devon.  The Conservative defences vary from safe to marginal, and let's start with the most vulnerable of them.  Remember to park your car in the car park...

<h2>Rosehill with Burrnley Wood</h2>

Burrnley council, Lancashire; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Phil Chamberlain.

Where better to start the week than in the county of the Red Rose?  Let's go to East Lancashire, where the accent is distinctively rhotic and the tipple of choice is Bénédictine with hot water.  Welcome to Burrnley.

In many ways Burrnley is the stereotype of the Lancashire mill town, although coalmining was a major industry here as well.  The town was put on the map as early as 1801 with the opening of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, and the resulting boom led to Burrnley Wood being developed.  Southeast of the town centre and on the far side of the canal, Burrnley Wood was an area of Coronation Streets, terraces to house millworkers off the main road towards Todmorden.

For electoral purposes Burrnley Wood is combined with Rosehill, a more upmarket area off the Manchester Road.  But Rosehill is outclassed in the housing stakes by Towneley Hall, which was home to the Towneley family from the thirteenth century onwards.  The male line of the Towneleys died out in 1878 leaving the Hall in the hands of Alice, the dowager Baroness O'Hagan.  She eventually sold the Hall and Park to Burrnley Corporation, who still run the hall today as a museum.

Overlooking all this from the moorland above the ward is the Singing Ringing Tree, a sculpture which was built in 2006 as part of the "Panopticon" series of sculptures dotted around the moors of East Lancashire to mark the area's recent renaissance.  The Singing Ringing Tree is a series of steel pipes into which holes have been cut, allowing the ever-present wind to play the sculpture like an instrument.  It's a discordant noise.

https://youtu.be/dRYlblqXUmk

Which rather reflects the discordance in the town below.  Burrnley has had race riots in the past, and is an extremely racially-divided town whose Asian population is essentially crammed into a single ward, leaving places like Rosehill and Burrnley Wood as 94% white.  There's still a lot of manufacturing in Burrnley but the sector doesn't employ anywhere near as many people as it used to; and the housing stock, particularly in Burrnley Wood, declined to the point that terraces were still being cleared here into the 21st century.  Anywhere else in the country these houses would have been snapped up, refurbished and put to use, but not in Burrnley.

Andrew's Previews previously visited this ward in April 2019.  My piece on Rosehill and Burrnley Wood three years ago (<em>Andrew's Previews 2019</em>, page 86) had a few points to say about the politics and significance of provincial towns, which I described as
<blockquote>
very much on the unfashionable side of the great divides of our time - Labour versus Tory, progressive versus conservative, urban versus rural, north versus south, young versus old, harmony versus discord, and of course Leave versus Remain ... but it's important to understand towns to know Britain as it is today and as it will be in the future.

Apart from anything else, the list of the key marginal constituencies which will decide the next general election (whenever that is) is dominated by English provincial towns.  Anybody whose first instinct is to denigrate provincial towns just because they voted to leave the EU those three long years ago needs to put those prejudices away and start thinking and acting in terms that are less insulting.
</blockquote>

What a difference three years makes.  These days there appears to be a catch-all shorthand for this kind of argument - the dreaded "R*d W*ll", of which Burrnley is a part.  The Burrnley parliamentary seat, which has the same boundaries as the borough, voted for all three main political parties in the 2010s, being won by the Liberal Democrats in 2010, by the Conservatives in 2019 and by Labour in between.

Whenever your columnist has to listen to other people talking about the "R*d W*ll", a little bit of me dies inside.  But it is fair to say that the Brexit debates breathed fresh life into the Burrnley Conservatives, not least because their rather small and moribund council group was essentially subjected to a reverse takeover by UKIP.  Burrnley has always had a propensity to vote for the radical right in local elections, as we can see from the fact that the BNP topped the poll across the borough in 2003.  In 2017, which was a poor year for UKIP, the only county council seat they won in the whole of England was Padiham and Burrnley West; Alan Hosker, the elected county councillor that year, now leads the Conservative group on Burrnley council.

The Burrnley Conservatives have held the parliamentary seat since 2019, but they are in opposition on the council.  Burrnley council is hung, with at present 18 Labour councillors, 8 Lib Dems, 6 Conservatives, 6 Greens, 5 councillors for the localist Burrnley and Padiham Independent Party, and an ex-Conservative independent.  Control of the council has been a bit chaotic since Labour lost their majority in 2019; an anti-Labour rainbow coalition fell apart in 2020, and at present there is a Labour-Lib Dem coalition running the show.

Rosehill and Burrnley Wood has generally been in the Liberal Democrat column since 2006, although it did vote Labour in 2012 and (by seven votes) in 2015.  The outgoing councillor here, Phil Chamberlain, is the only Conservative returned for the ward this century: he won here in 2021 on a very close three-way result, with just 32% of the vote against 31% for Labour and 28% for the defending Lib Dems.  That poor Lib Dem performance also fed through into the Lancashire county council elections, in which the Lib Dems lost Burrnley South West (which includes Rosehill) to Labour; Burrnley Wood is part of the Burrnley Rural county division, a safe Conservative unit currently represented by Cosima Towneley.  Yes, of the Burrnley Towneleys.

Judging from the May 2022 results here, the Conservatives are facing an uphill struggle to defend this seat.  Six months ago the Liberal Democrats' outgoing councillor Jeff Sumner was re-elected with a 56-24 lead over Labour here, with the Tories finishing a poor third.

Lib Dem councillor Sumner is not on the best of terms with outgoing Conservative councillor Chamberlain, and in September the council's standards committee recommended disciplinary action against both of them as the result of an altercation which had to be stopped by a member of the public stepping in.  Chamberlain resigned from the council in response to the committee's decision.

Defending this seat for the Conservatives is Maison McGowan-Doe, who contested Rosegrove with Lowerhouse ward in May.  The Lib Dem candidate is Russell Neal, who is a trustee of the Burrnley Wood Community Centre.  Labour's Bill Horrocks has stood in Coal Clough with Deerplay ward at the last four local elections.  Also standing is Anthony Davis of the Green Party.

<h2>Greasley</h2>

Broxtowe council, Nottinghamshire; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Eddie Cubley.

The East Midlands is the focus for three of our by-elections today, including the final part of our recent Erewash valley trilogy.  Last week we saw the Conservatives lose a Nottinghamshire county council by-election in Eastwood to an independent candidate; yes, Jason Zadrozny was involved, and yes, I did warn you that was coming.

That by-election resulted from the death of the Conservatives' Eddie Cubley who sat on both the county council and Broxtowe district council.  Today we fill his district council seat in Greasley ward, which surrounds the town of Eastwood on its eastern and southern sides and is rather different political territory to it.  The ward takes its name from Greasley parish, but there is no village of that name any more: the Earl of Rutland demolished it so he could have a better view, because if you were an aristocrat in those days you could do that sort of thing.

A more complete ruin within the ward is Beauvale Priory, a Carthusian monastery founded in 1343 and suppressed at the Dissolution in the 1530s.  The penultimate prior, Robert Lawrence, was hanged, drawn and quartered in 1535 for refusing to swear that Henry VIII was now head of the church, because if you were a king in those days you could do that sort of thing.  Lawrence is recognised by the Catholic church as one of the Forty Martyrs of England and Wales.

The modern population of Greasley ward lives in Giltbrook and Newthorpe, which are Eastwood suburbs.  Giltbrook has come to the attention of many people in the East Midlands in recent years as the home of the East Midlands branch of IKEA, located just off the Eastwood bypass.  Owner-occupation in the ward is high and there is a larger than usual retired population.

Six years ago I described Greasley ward in this column as a safe Conservative unit (<em>Andrew's Previews 2016</em>, page 41), and nothing has happened since to make me revise that opinion.  The late Eddie Cubley won that by-election with 49% of the vote against 22% for Labour and 17% for UKIP; the 2019 Broxtowe elections here were a straight fight between the Conservatives and Labour which the Conservatives won 64-36.  However, the Conservatives lost the local county division (Greasley and Brinsley) to an independent in 2021.

There's no independent candidate in this by-election, though.  Defending for the Conservatives is Linsey Ellis, who gives an address in Kimberley to the south-east of this ward.  The Labour candidate is Danny Hall.  This time there will not be a straight fight, because Reece Oliver has been nominated by the Lib Dems.

<h2>Bourne East; and<br/>
Grantham St Wulfram's</h2>

South Kesteven council, Lincolnshire; caused respectively by the death of Judith Smith and the resignation of Jacky Smith, both of whom were Conservative councillors.

We now travel east for two by-elections in Lincolnshire towns, starting with Grantham.  This is a town with a lot of history, notably in the form of the King's School.  A grammar school which is still going today, the King's School educated the great scientist Isaac Newton during the late 1650s; a signature attributed to Newton is carved into the school wall.  This school also has a current MP among its former pupils: Ben Everitt, the Conservative MP for Milton Keynes North.

Isaac Newton was from a village in the area, but another very consequential scientist - and Conservative politician - comes from the town-centre Grantham St Wulfram's ward.  On 13th October 1925, Grantham alderman Alfred Roberts and his wife Beatrice had a baby girl called Margaret, who was born in the family shop on the corner of North Parade and Broad Street.  Under her married surname of Thatcher, Margaret went on to serve as Prime Minister for over a decade and transform the UK.

Grantham has recently taken delivery of a statue of Margaret Thatcher, which was erected in the town in May after Westminster council refused permission for it to stand in Parliament Square.  Westminster had worried that a Thatcher statue would be a focus for civil disobedience and vandalism, and their fears would appear to have been well-founded given that the Grantham statue has been subjected to repeated attacks.  We're not talking vandalism on the scale of the Gävle Goat here, but the council have had to put the Bronze Lady under CCTV surveillance.

Some distance to the south-east of Grantham lies Bourne, which can be found on the western edge of the Lincolnshire fens.  Bourne East ward accordingly covers a large amount of fenland, including the intriguingly-named village of Twenty on the road towards Boston.  Boundary changes for the 2015 election cut Bourne East ward from three councillors to two, as the result of the creation of a new Bourne Austerby ward covering the south of the town.

The local authority for both Bourne and Grantham is South Kesteven council, which is based in Grantham.  Appropriately enough for the birthplace of Thatcher it's Conservative-controlled, and the party's majority hasn't been much affected by a number of by-elections in this term.  The Conservatives have previously had five South Kesteven seats to defend in by-elections, holding four and losing one to an independent.

There are two more South Kesteven by-elections today and another coming up next month, so eight of the 56 councillors elected in 2019 haven't made it to the end of their term.  That's a rather high proportion, but it's hard to distinguish by-election numbers from random noise so not much should be read into this.

On previous form an independent challenge here might well be more likely in Bourne East, where independent candidate Philip Knowles topped the poll at the last district elections in 2019 and gained his seat from the Conservatives; shares of the vote, with some caveats given the strong independent showing, were 46% for Knowles and 38% for the Conservatives.  Grantham St Wulfram's was strongly Conservative in 2019, the Tory slate enjoying a 60-23 majority over the Green Party.

Both of these by-elections are to replace long-serving Conservative councillors.  Judy Smith, who died in September at the age of 79, was first elected to South Kesteven council in 2003; she was Mayor of Bourne in 2005-06.  Jacky Smith, who is
also of that older generation, is retiring after eleven years' service for St Wulfram's ward.  They were not related.

Both of these by-elections have attracted large fields.  Defending Bourne East for the Conservatives is Julia Reid, who was the losing Conservative candidate here in 2019.  Reid is a Bourne town councillor as is independent candidate Brenda Johnson, who is listed on her town council register of interests from 2020 as "employed by as a Housing Assistant for South Kesteven District Council"; if she's still doing that job it might be construed as a disqualification, but if Johnson does turn out to be disqualified there won't be time to organise another by-election before the next South Kesteven council elections in May.  Also standing in Bourne East are Alex Molyneux for Labour, Rhys Baker for the Greens and John Ireland - a former councillor in Chichester, Fareham and Portsmouth - for the Lib Dems.

In Grantham St Wulfram's the defending Conservative candidate is Mary Whittington, who contested Loveden Heath ward in 2019; she is hoping to join her husband Mark on the council.  The Green Party's Ian Simmons returns after his runner-up finish in 2019.  Also standing are Archie Hine for Labour and independent candidate Tim Harrison.

<h2>Cannock West</h2>

Cannock Chase council, Staffordshire; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Doug Smith.

We now leave the West Midlands by way of Cannock.  Cannock West is pretty much what it says on the tin, consisting of housing west of Cannock town centre; also here is a smaller built-up area to the north of the town centre around Cannock Chase Hospital.

It would be stretching it a bit to describe Cannock West as Cannock's middle-class enclave, but the census return for the area certainly has better education levels and higher levels of owner-occupation than the other Cannock wards.  However, when local election time comes around this is by far the safest Conservative ward in Cannock Chase, and the party were rarely troubled here even when Labour were running the council.  In 2014 Cannock West was the only Cannock Chase ward to vote Conservative; by contrast, the Tories took overall control of the council in 2021, and in 2022 Cannock West gave the Conservatives a 60-28 lead over Labour.

(Clive) Doug Smith has stepped down after six years in office, having been first elected in 2016.  To replace him the Conservatives have selected Bill Kenny, who narrowly lost in the neighbouring ward of Cannock South in May.  Labour have reselected their candidate from May Steven Thornley.  Eloise Cropp, of the Green Party, is the only other candidate to stand.

<h2>Braintree South; and<br/>
Coggeshall</h2>

Braintree council, Essex; caused respectively by the resignations of Conservative-turned-independent councillor Dean Wallace and independent councillor Richard Unsworth.

We now come into the south of England through Essex.  The town of Braintree goes back a long way: it grew up at the place where two Roman roads crossed each other, and became a town in 1190 with the award of a market charter by Richard I.  This has been a textile centre for centuries, first with the wool trade (which was helped by Flemish migrants) and then with silk manufacturing.  Here this was dominated by the Courtaulds textile firm, which was a major employer in Braintree in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.

This long history of textiles also supported the small town of Coggeshall, located on Stane Street a few miles to the east of Braintree.  Unlike Braintree this was a minor religious centre, with Coggeshall Abbey being founded in 1140 by King Stephen and Queen Matilda of Boulogne (that's Stephen's wife, not the Empress Matilda).  The Abbey's gatehouse chapel still stands and is the oldest surviving brick building in England to be built after the Romans left.  Coggeshall's woollen trade provided the money for an extremely oversized church in the town, dedicated to St Peter ad Vincula; the present-day church dates from the 15th century.  The present-day Coggeshall ward also covers the parishes of Bradwell and Stisted, which cover the countryside between Coggeshall and Braintree.

The Braintree South ward covers the part of the town lying to the south of the railway line, a single-track branch line which travels south to meet the main line at Witham.  Braintree station and Braintree Freeport station (named after a shopping development outside the ward boundary which it serves) are on the boundary of South ward.

The Braintree parliamentary constituency is a safe base for the Foreign Secretary James Cleverly, who has only been in the Commons since 2015 but cut his political teeth as a member of the London Assembly for seven years before that.  Braintree council also has a large Conservative majority: the 2019 elections here returned 34 Conservatives against 6 Greens, 4 Halstead Residents, 3 independent councillors and 2 Labour.  Braintree South ward is included in the Conservative majority: in 2019 the Conservative slate won here with 49% against 30% for Labour and 21% for the Green Party.  The local Essex county division of Braintree Town has voted Labour in this century but returned a large Conservative majority in 2021.

Coggeshall town is within the equally-safe Conservative seat of Witham, which is represented by the former Home Secretary Priti Patel.  However, the ward returned two independent councillors in 2019, representing two gains from the Conservatives; it wasn't close, with the independent slate having a 61-28 lead.  This may have been connected to a controversial proposal for a waste incinerator in the area.  Most of Coggeshall ward is part of the Braintree Eastern county council division, which was gained by the Green Party last year.

Nick Unsworth, one of the independent councillors for Coggeshall, has resigned from Braintree council as he is moving away from the town.  This is a common enough reason for a local government resignation, but what's unusual here is that Unsworth isn't moving far away at all: his new home is in the village of Colne Engaine, a few miles to the north and still within Braintree district.  The Braintree South by-election is to replace Dean Wallace, who was elected on the Conservative slate but had left the party and gone independent some time before his resignation from the council.

So the Conservatives will be looking to recover a defection loss in Braintree South with their new candidate Stephen Canning, who is a chartered PR consultant.  He has a political history.  Canning was first elected to Braintree council in 2011 when he was just 18, then representing Bocking Blackwater ward; in 2015 he was elected to Essex county council by gaining a by-election in Bocking from UKIP.  Canning was then suspended from the Conservative party in 2018 over an alleged assault, and was not reselected for the 2019 Braintree or 2021 Essex county elections, but now appears to be back in the Tory fold.  The Labour candidate is Martin Green, while the Green Party candidate Simon Attwood completes the Braintree South candidate list.

There are also three candidates in Coggeshall.  One independent candidate has come forward to replace Nick Unsworth: he is Coggeshall resident Dennis Abram, who appears to be fighting his first election campaign.  The Conservative candidate is Chris Siddall, who is the Essex county councillor for Halstead division (which does not cover this ward).  Labour's Robert Powers completes a second all-male ballot paper.

<h2>Green Lane and St James</h2>

Kingston upon Thames council, London; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Tim Cobbett.

Our Liberal Democrat defence of the week comes in outer south-west London with a ward whose name won't mean much to non-locals.  This is the western end of New Malden, a London suburb on the South Western main line.  Green Lane and St James ward lies to the north of the A3 Malden Way dual carriageway and to the west of the Hogsmill River.  The area next to the river is generally open space, used as playing fields by the London School of Economics, but most of the rest has been built on with houses.

Green Lane and St James ward is brand-new, created by boundary changes in May 2022 from the western end of the former Beverley and St James wards.  Both of these have a significant population of Asian origin; in the 2011 census St James just scraped into the top 100 wards in England and Wales for Hinduism, while New Malden more generally is home to the UK's largest Korean community.

This column discussed the history of Beverley ward in some detail in June when covering the new ward of New Malden Village, which borders Green Lane and St James ward to the east; an independent candidate there in the 2022 London local elections passed away, and the poll had to be postponed.  Both the former Beverley ward and the former St James ward were closely fought between the Conservatives and Lib Dems in the period 2002-18.  I described both former wards in this column during the Coalition years.  Derek Osbourne, the former Lib Dem leader of Kingston council, was unmasked as a paedophile in 2013 and the Conservatives gained the resulting by-election in Beverley ward; Howard Jones, a former Conservative group leader on the council, passed away shortly after the 2014 election and the Conservatives held the resulting by-election a week before Christmas.  Beverley and St James between them returned a full slate of Conservatives in 2014 when the Tories gained control of the council, and a full slate of Lib Dems in 2018 when the Lib Dems did likewise.

The local MP is Sir Ed Davey, who became leader of the Liberal Democrats in 2020 after Jo Swinson lost her seat in the 2019 general election.  Davey saw his Lib Dems perform very well in the 2022 local elections, in which the party won 44 seats out of a possible 48.  The ones that got away were three Conservatives and one councillor of the Kingston Independent Residents Group, who was elected here in Green Lane and St James ward.  Shares of the vote here in May were 39% for the Lib Dems who won the other seat, 37% for the Residents and 13% for the Conservatives.

The Lib Dem candidate elected here in May was Tim Cobbett, who at the time was deputy leader of the council.  Cobbett handed in his resignation in September, indicating that he had taken up a new job and was relocating away from the area.

This leaves the Lib Dems with a tricky by-election to defend in their leader's constituency.  Unfortunately, their selection of Mahmood Rafiq appears to have prompted some dirty politics.  Rafiq is an Ahmadiyya Muslim and head of external affairs for the Ahmadiyya Muslim Association.  The Kingston Independent Residents Group have claimed responsibility for a leaflet making divisive and Islamophobic attacks on Rafiq, an action which has been condemned by all the other parties standing in this by-election; responsibility for this leaflet will fall on the Residents' candidate Yvonne Tracey, a former deputy manager of New Malden's post office who was the Residents' losing candidate here in May.  Another returning candidate from May is Suniya Qureshi for the Conservatives.  Nick Draper completes the ballot paper for Labour.

<h2>Newton Poppleford and Harpford</h2>

East Devon council; caused by the death of Independent East Devon Alliance councillor Val Ranger.

We finish for the week with a ward covering the gorgeous countryside of eastern Devon.  Indeed Newton Poppleford and Harpford ward is entirely within the East Devon Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, one step down from a National Park in terms of protection of the landscape.  Newton Poppleford lies on the main road from Exeter to Sidmouth at the point where the road crosses the Otter valley; Newton Poppleford is on the west bank, with the smaller village of Harpford on the east bank.

We are within the East Devon district and parliamentary seat, where the Conservatives have been strongly challenged in recent years by independent candidates.  Claire Wright, an independent who until last year sat on Devon county council, finished in second place here at the 2015, 2017 and 2019 general elections, on the latter occasion with over 40% of the vote.

The Conservatives lost their majority on East Devon council at the 2019 election, and an coalition led by the Independent East Devon Alliance is now running the show.  The independents are not a united bloc, with the 2019 election returning 19 independents, 11 councillors from the Independent East Devon Alliance, 8 Lib Dems and 2 Greens; the 20 Conservatives elected in 2019 are in opposition.  The Conservatives have since gained two independent seats in by-elections, while last year Labour won a seat on the council for the first time this century by gaining a by-election in Honiton from the Lib Dems.

That's because the Independent East Devon Alliance total includes Newton Poppleford and Harpford ward, which their councillor Val Ranger gained from the Conservatives in 2015; she was re-elected in 2019 with a massive 86% of the vote in a straight fight with the Conservatives.  Compare and contrast with 2011, when nobody opposed the Conservative candidate here.  Newton Poppleford and Harpford is part of the Otter Valley county division which Claire Wright represented until she retired last year; she passed the seat on to another independent candidate who was elected with a large majority, if not quite as large as Ranger's.

Alongside her East Devon council duties Val Ranger was a teacher at Exeter College until 2020, when she had to leave her job after being diagnosed with stomach cancer.  She passed away in August, having been appointed as vice-chair of the council a few months previously.

There is no defending candidate from the Independent East Devon Alliance, so we have a free-for-all with an awful lot of votes up for grabs here.  The percentage vote share changes reported by Britain Elects will be wild.  Given that recent independent pedigree here you'd have to think that the independent candidate in this by-election would have a good chance: that's Chris Burhop, who is the chair of Newton Poppleford and Harpford parish council.  The Conservatives have selected Paul Carter, who previously sat on East Devon council in 2015-19 for Ottery St Mary Rural ward; he lost re-election in 2019 in the redrawn Ottery St Mary ward.  For the first time since 2003 we have a three-way contest here, with Caleb Early being nominated for Labour.
