"All the right votes, but not necessarily in the right order"

</p><p>
Two by-elections on 4th August 2022:
</p><p>
<h2>Dallow</h2>
</p><p>
Luton council, Bedfordshire; caused by the disqualification of Labour councillor Hannah Adrees.
</p><p>
The two wards up for election in the first week of August 2022 could not be more different in character.  We'll start in Luton.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/luton-dallow.png" alt="Luton, Dallow" />
</p><p>
Dallow ward runs west from the edge of Luton town centre as far as the M1 motorway, covering housing along the namesake Dallow Road and other areas to the south of the Dunstable Road.  Much of the ward is occupied by a large industrial estate overlooked by the open space of Dallow Downs, with the ward's housing concentrated on its edges.  The eastern end of Dallow ward, Bury Park, is strongly built up with Edwardian terraces, which hide a secret: tucked behind some of those houses is Kenilworth Road Stadium, the home of Luton Town FC.
</p><p>

</p><p>
You may notice from the map of the ward an unfamiliar dashed blue line running from east to west, next to Hatters Way.  This is the Luton-Dunstable guided busway, opened in 2013 on the route of the former railway connecting the two towns.  High-speed buses between Luton and Dunstable make two stops within this ward, at Clifton Road (behind the football ground) and Chaul End Lane.
</p><p>
Since the 1970s Bury Park has been a strongly Muslim area, mostly of Pakistani heritage.  Further waves of immigration mean that nearly all of the ward's census districts record high levels of foreign languages being spoken: Urdu, Bengali, Sylheti and Polish speakers are strongly represented.  We can see the effect of this in other parts of Dallow ward's 2011 census return.  Dallow had the highest under-16 population of any ward in the Eastern region (29.3%), and was in the top 30 in England and Wales.  It was in the top 20 wards in England and Wales for Islam (62%), in the top 25 for Asian ethnicity (67%) and those looking after home or family (11.5%), in the top 40 for those who have never worked or were long-term unemployed (19.5%) and in the top 90 for those born outside the EU (38.6%).
</p><p>
The effect of the Muslim vote is so strong here that in the 2003 local elections Dallow ward returned three candidates all called Mohammed: Ashraf and Farooq for Labour, Bashir as an independent candidate.  Bashir Mohammed lost his seat in 2007 and Labour have had a monopoly of councillors here since.  At the last Luton elections in 2019 the Labour slate polled 66% of the vote, with the runner-up spot on 20% going to outgoing Labour councillor Mohammed Ashraf who had sought re-election as an independent.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/luton19.png" alt="Luton, 2019" />
</p><p>
The only polls here since were for the December 2019 general election and the 2021 Bedfordshire Police and Crime Commissioner election.  Mohammed Ashraf also stood in the first of those elections, contesting the local constituency of Luton South in December 2019: he came sixth out of seven candidates and lost his deposit.  Labour had little trouble holding Luton South in 2019 despite their outgoing MP Gavin Shuker defecting to Change UK (or whatever they were called that week) and eventually seeking re-election as an independent; Shuker, who was endorsed by the local Lib Dems, finished a poor third but saved his deposit.
</p><p>
Top of the Labour slate for Dallow ward in 2019 was new candidate Hannah Adrees, who at the time was a paralegal in her early 20s.  Adrees' uncle had suffered a heart attack in 2011 which left him with brain damage, and his family received regular payments from Luton council to fund his social care.  By December 2017, when Hannah Adrees took over the running of the relevant bank account, this amounted to around £14,000 a year.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, not all of this sum was actually used for the intended purpose of social care.  Luton council launched a prosecution against its own councillor, and in June 2022 Luton Crown Court heard that over a two-year period Adrees had diverted £7,500 of the adult social care money for her own use: about half of it was used to fund her legal studies.  Adrees pleaded guilty to fraud by abuse of position, and recorder Howard Cohen sentenced her to eight months imprisonment, suspended for 18 months, with a requirement to undertake 200 hours of unpaid work.
</p><p>
If Adrees had been an MP, this would have resulted in a recall petition.  However, a suspended sentence of 8 months meant that she was instead disqualified from Luton council, because we hold our councillors to higher standards than we do our MPs.  It's hard to see Adrees' legal career continuing, either.
</p><p>
Defending this by-election for Labour is Alia Khan, who is a student reading history at the School of Oriental and African Studies; she also has a post at the Association of Commonwealth Universities.  The independent from last time has not returned, but there is a new independent to replace him: Marc Scheimann is a perennial candidate in Luton elections, mostly with the Green Party although he has stood as an independent in the last few years.  The Conservatives have selected Malik Azad Nikyalvi, who completes the ballot paper along with Basharat Hussain for the Lib Dems.

<h2>North Isles</h2>
</p><p>
Shetland Islands council, Scotland; caused by insufficient candidates in the May 2022 ordinary election.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/shetland-n-isles.png" alt="Shetland, N Isles" />
</p><p>
And now for something completely different, as we travel to the UK's northernmost ward.  In 2020 this column brought to you the North Isles ward of Orkney (<em>Andrew's Previews 2020</em>, page 96); nearly two years on, it's time to visit that ward's Shetland namesake.
</p><p>
The largest of the Shetland North Isles by area is Yell, located across Yell Sound from Mainland, whose economy is based on agriculture, fishing and peat cutting: around two-thirds of Yell is covered with peat.  Yell is linked to Mainland in the south by regular ferries, while further ferries run east to Fetlar and Unst.
</p><p>
Unst is the UK's northernmost inhabited island, and because of this it is home to a lot of seabirds and a number of strategic interests.  In the past these included chromite mining and a radar station, RAF Saxa Vord, which closed in 2006 with the loss of more than 100 jobs - a big blow to the island's economy.  Despite the decline of air travel here - Baltasound Airport has been mothballed since 1996 and is only available for emergency flights - Unst is in the sights of planners for outer space, with its high latitude (60¾° North) and location away from the main transatlantic aircraft routes being seen as a perfect location for launching satellites into polar orbits.  Plans ware submitted to Shetland council last year for three launchpads on Unst.
</p><p>
There are two British islands north of Unst, but the "full stop at the end of Scotland", Out Stack - at 60° 51½‘ North the UK's northernmost point - has never been inhabited.  People did once live on Muckle Flugga, but they were evacuated in 1995 when that island's lighthouse was automated.  The Muckle Flugga lighthouse was built by the Stevenson family, and Robert Louis Stevenson came here; the map in Stevenson's <em>Treasure Island</em> is said to be based on Unst.  Judge for yourself.
</p><p>
</p><p>

<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/unst.png" alt="Treasure Island" />
</p><p>
X marks the spot of two other islands within the North Isles ward, although these are located east of Mainland and their ferry links go there.  The tiny Out Skerries archipelago, which was briefly home in recent years to Scotland's smallest cinema, was once on the front line of the Second World War as a landing point for Norwegian refugees.  Mary Anderson, of the Skerries island of Grunay, was the only Shetlander to be killed in a German air-raid during that war; Grunay was evacuated shortly afterwards.  Closer to Mainland is Whalsay, which claims the title of the UK's most northerly 18-hole golf course.
</p><p>
For some time Whalsay was home to Christopher Grieve, better known as the writer Hugh MacDiarmid, who combined his poetry and other writing with serious left-wing politics.  MacDiarmid did hold elected office - he was a member of Angus county council in the 1920s - but his three parliamentary campaigns all ended in lost deposits.  He fought Glasgow Kelvingrove for the SNP in 1945 and as an independent in 1950, before polling just 127 votes as the Communist candidate against the Prime Minister Sir Alec Douglas-Home in Kinross and West Perthshire in 1964.
</p><p>
Despite that poor showing MacDiarmid then launched a case in the Election Court.  In brief, he argued that Douglas-Home should have included the cost of BBC and ITA television broadcasts, in which Douglas-Home had appeared as leader of the Conservative party, on his election expenses.  Election TV broadcasts were fairly novel in those days - the Rochdale by-election of February 1958 was the first election to see extensive TV coverage - and the legal position of those broadcasts had not previously been tested in the courts.  In the event the Election Court (<i>Grieve v Douglas-Home</i> 1965 SC 315) rejected MacDiarmid's argument and upheld Douglas-Home's election, finding that the broadcasts were part of the national campaign rather than Douglas-Home's local campaign.  The distinction between national and local spending in general elections persists to this day.
</p><p>
Partly because of their remoteness, the North Isles have turned in recent years to renewable energy in a big way.  Every island has its own set of wind turbines, Yell has a tidal power station, and Unst is experimenting with using wind energy to run a hydrogen power plant.  Most of this power is community-owned.  Back in the day this ward's major export was fish, with Burravoe on Yell and Uyeasound on Unst having Hanseatic League warehouses; at the turn of the 20th century Baltasound, on Unst, vied with Lerwick for the title of Scotland's largest herring catch.
</p><p>
But in the modern day it's North Sea oil and gas that has made Shetland rich, and those fossil fuels make landfall on Mainland at the Sullom Voe oil terminal.  The Shetland Islands council has extensive powers (derived from the Zetland County Council Act 1974) to direct the local fossil fuel industry, which the council used to force all the various oil and gas firms to share Sullom Voe.  The Act of 1974 also gave the council harbour rights over Yell Sound, which is why the boundaries for North Isles ward take in a large amount of sea there and nowhere else.
</p><p>
All of these islands have small populations.  Whalsay is the only island here with over 1,000 people as of the 2011 census, with Yell just under 1,000, Unst around 650 and Fetlar and the Skerries in double figures.  For this by-election the Shetland Islands council has organised six polling stations, two each on Yell and Unst and one each on Whalsay and Fetlar; the few people who live on the Skerries presumably have postal votes.
</p><p>
The Shetland Islands council as a whole is the fourth-smallest principal council in the UK by population - only the Orkney Islands, the City of London and the Isles of Scilly come in lower.  Like the three councils below it, its local politics are generally non-partisan.  The North Isles ward was created in 2007, and all elections here to date have been contested entirely by independent candidates.  Following the May 2022 elections here the Shetland Islands council consists of 19 independent councillors with one seat each for the Greens, Labour and the SNP, plus one vacancy.
</p><p>
That vacancy will be filled in today's North Isles by-election, which arises because not enough candidates stood in May.  When nominations closed for the 2022 local elections only two candidates had stood, outgoing councillors Ryan Thomson and Duncan Anderson who were both first elected in 2017 (Anderson was elected in that year under his previous name of Duncan Simpson).  This left North Isles one short of its full complement of three councillors, so a by-election has been arranged to fill the final seat.
</p><p>
Five candidates have stood this time round.  First alphabetically is Gary Cleaver, from Unst, who was previously a councillor for this ward from 2012 to 2017.  Stewart Douglas contested Shetland South ward in May, polling just 2.5% there.  Sonia Robertson runs R Robertson and Son, a bus firm from Yell.  Another Yell-based candidate is Robert Thomson, a seaman who currently runs a yacht charter business; despite that his manifesto calls for tunnels to link Yell and Unst to Mainland.  Last of the five candidates is Marie Williamson, who was runner-up in May in Lerwick North and Bressay ward.  As usual here, all five candidates are independents.  The usual Scottish disclaimers apply: it's Votes at 16 and the Alternative Vote is in use, so mark your ballot paper in order of preference.
