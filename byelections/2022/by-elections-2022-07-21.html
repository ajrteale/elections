"All the right votes, but not necessarily in the right order"

</p><p>
One by-election on Wednesday 20th July 2022:
</p><p>
<h2>Nethermayne</h2>
</p><p>
Basildon council, Essex; caused by the death of independent councillor Pauline Kettle.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/basildon-nethermayne.png" alt="Basildon, Nethermayne" />
</p><p>
By-elections don't have to be held on a Thursday.  Any working day will do, and sometimes it's more convenient for everyone involved for a poll to be held on a different day of the week than is traditional.  In this case Basildon has a full council meeting scheduled for Thursday evening of this week, so the winner of Wednesday's by-election will be able to make an immediate start to their new post.
</p><p>
So it is that we make a Wednesday trip to Nethermayne.  Nethermayne is the main road running south from Basildon town centre towards the A13 dual carriageway and the village of Fobbing beyond it.  The road gives its name to an electoral ward of southern Basildon  which takes in the Lee Chapel South and Kingswood areas, together with part of Vange on the far side of a hill from the rest of the ward.  The main employer here is the Basildon University Hospital, the main general hospital for the New Town.  Nethermayne ward's northern boundary is the London, Tilbury and Southend railway line, with Basildon railway station providing frequent connections to the City of London and to the newer city of Southend-on-Sea.
</p><p>
Much of this ward's housing stock is New Town development from the late 1960s, although the Kingswood area has seen some redevelopment in recent years, and the ward's census return tends towards the working-class end.  We can see the ward's New Town origins in that a quarter of the ward's housing is still socially rented.
</p><p>
Nethermayne ward has some very unusual voting patterns for that sort of demograpic profile.  In the 2010s this was a Liberal Democrat hotspot, and the party still had enough strength here after the Coaliition was formed to win a July 2010 by-election and hold a seat in 2012.  However, both of those votes were on low vote shares - 33.5% and 35.8% respectively, indicative of the fact that politics here was becoming fragmented.  You can't keep winning on freak vote splits like that forever.
</p><p>
The 2011, 2012 and 2014 local elections here were contested by someone who is notable enough for Wikipedia.  Terry Marsh was a professional boxer, who rose to become IBF world champion at light welterweight in 1987; he retired from boxing later that year as an undefeated champion.  Marsh had an eventful post-boxing career: he was acquitted of attempting to murder the boxing promoter Frank Warren at a 1990 trial, and then went into politics as the Lib Dem candidate for Basildon in the 1997 general election.
</p><p>
In 2009 Marsh changed his name by deed poll to "None of the Above X" as a protest against the fact that UK ballot papers do not have a "none of the above" option, and he has contested a number of elections in Basildon since under that name.   It would appear that there isn't much appeal for this sort of thing in Basildon: None of the Above X finished last in Nethermayne ward in 2011, 2012 and 2014, failing to break 100 votes on each occasion.  Marsh wasn't a candidate here in the 2017 Essex county council election, but nonetheless hit the headlines after taking his ballot paper out of the polling station (which is an electoral offence), and then physically attacking the presiding officer who tried to stop him; Marsh was prosecuted for assault, and fined.
</p><p>
Instead it fell to somebody else to stamp their authority on Nethermayne's politics.  Kerry Smith started contesting this ward in the July 2010 by-election as a UK Independence Party candidate.  He was elected as the ward's Essex county councillor in 2013, won Nethermayne in 2014, and still holds both positions.  Smith had saved his deposit as the UKIP candidate for the local constituency of South Basildon and East Thurrock in 2010 and the party had readopted him for the 2015 general election, but he was forced to give that up in December 2014 after a recording of him making offensive remarks about the party's LGBT group and the people of Chigwell fell into the hands of the <em>Mail on Sunday</em>.
</p><p>
That was the end of Kerry Smith in UKIP, but his political career is still going strong nearly eight years later.  He is now an independent Basildon and Essex county councillor, has served as deputy leader of Basildon council, and saved his deposit as an independent candidate for South Basildon and East Thurrock in the December 2019 general election.  UKIP built on Smith's success to gain the other two seats in Nethermayne ward in 2015 and 2016 (from Labour and the Lib Dems respectively, on very low vote shares).
</p><p>
But the days of fragmented results in Nethermayne ward appear now to be over.  Kerry Smith was re-elected in 2018 as an independent candidate with a massive majority, and the 2019 and 2021 elections here also retured independent councillors easily (gaining their seats from UKIP).  In May this year Smith was re-elected for a third term with a 70-14 lead over Labour in Nethermayne ward.
</p><p>
This by-election is to replace independent councillor Pauline Kettle, who passed away at the end of May aged in her late 60s.  Kettle had gained her seat from UKIP in 2019, so the winner of this by-election will need to seek re-election in ten months' time.
</p><p>
One independent councillor has come forward to replace Kettle: Mo Larkin is a former Labour and Conservative member of Basildon council, who represented Lee Chapel North ward for Labour from 2002 to 2004 and Pitsea South East for the Tories from 2007 to 2015.  She was the first Mayor of Basildon, serving as the town's first citizen from 2010 (when Basildon received its borough charter) until stepping down from the council in 2015.  Labour have reseelcted their candidate here from May, Dylan Wright.  Also standing are Mark Cottrell for the Conservatives (who control Basildon council and represent the local constituency), the Lib Dems' Stephen Nice who will be hoping to disprove the theory that nice guys finish last, and Michael Kinnane for Reform UK.

<!--    WEDNESDAY PREVIEW ENDS HERE
        THURSDAY PREVIEW STARTS HERE   --->
</p><p>
There are three by-elections on Thursday 21st July 2022, all resulting from the deaths of councillors.  Later we shall come to the week's Labour defence in Morecambe, but before then we have two Conservative defences to discuss in the West Midlands region...
</p><p>
<h2>Penkridge North East and Acton Trussell</h2>
</p><p>
South Staffordshire council; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Isabel Ford.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/s-staffs-penkridge-ne-acton-trussell.png" alt="S Staffs, Penkridge NE/Acton Trussell" />
</p><p>
We'll start with a ward in the Staffordshire countryside, where many pass through but few stop.  Penkridge can be found a few miles to the south of Stafford, next to the Stafford-Wolverhampton railway line and the M6 motorway.
</p><p>
This is an older town than it looks.  The Roman Road of Watling Street lies a few miles to the south of Penkridge, and the Romans were here with a fort at <em>Pennocrucium</em> and a villa at Acton Trussell.  Penkridge has a large collegiate church, dedicated to St Michael and All Angels, which testifies that it was an important mediaeval centre despite that fact that large tracts of the surrounding countryside were under Forest Law: the town lies on the western edge of the high ground of Cannock Chase, which remains relatively undeveloped today.
</p><p>
Some of this area can be found in the Penkridge North East and Acton Trussell ward, which takes in four parishes located roughly between Penkridge and Stafford.  Acton Trussell itself is perhaps best known as the birthplace of Patrick Fyffe, who was doing drag acts long before the modern era of RuPaul as the Bracket in Hinge and Bracket.
</p><p>
The main service centre for this area is Stafford, and Penkridge is part of the Stafford parliamentary seat which has voted for the government on every occasion since it was recreated in 1983.  However, the town's local government is administered from faraway Wombourne as part of the South Staffordshire district, which covers a number of small towns within the general orbit of Wolverhampton and the Black Country.  South Staffordshire council has a large and long-standing Conservative majority.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/s-staffs19.png" alt="S Staffs, 2019" />
</p><p>
We can see this in previous election results for Penkridge North East and Acton Trussell ward, or more precisely in the lack of them.  This ward had until today seen only one contested election this century, in May 2011 when the Conservative slate polled 54% against 24% for an independent and 21% for Labour.  The other four South Staffordshire elections here since 2003 all returned the Conservative slate unopposed.  Until her recent death Isabel Ford had represented the ward throughout that period, and she beat the alphabet to top the poll here in 2011.
</p><p>
There was a contest here in the 2021 Staffordshire county elections, in which the Conservatives won the Penkridge county division with a 68-19 lead over Labour.  Two of this ward's parishes are in the Brewood county division, which is even more strongly Conservative.
</p><p>
For this ward's first contested election in eleven years the defending Conservative candidate is Penkridge parish councillor Andy Adams.  The Labour candidate Norman Alan Smallwood is also a Penkridge parish councillor.  Completing the ballot paper is Sam Harper-Wallis for the Liberal Democrats.

<h2>Hartshill</h2>
</p><p>
North Warwickshire council; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Barry Lees.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/n-warks-hartshill.png" alt="N Warks, Hartshill" />
</p><p>
We travel east along Watling Street for our other West Midlands by-election, which takes place in Hartshill.  This is a village on high ground overlooking the Anker valley to the east, through which the Coventry Canal and the West Coast Main Line pass.  Watling Street, which here forms the Warwickshire/Leicestershire border, is the ward's northern boundary.
</p><p>
Hartshill was the birthplace of Michael Drayton, an Elizabeth and Jacobean poet whose works are rather forgotten now but who is remembered here in the name of the local primary school.  Quarrying is an important local industry, and the ward's census return tends towards the working-class end.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/n-warks19.png" alt="N Warks, 2019" />
</p><p>
This has kept Labour competitive here, and Hartshill local elections in this century have often been closely fought with small majorities.  However, the Conservatives have pulled away over the last decade in line with local trends for the big town next door.  Although Hartshill lies within the North Warwickshire district, it is on the edge of Nuneaton's built-up area and is included within the Nuneaton parliamentary seat.  Recent elections in Nuneaton have seen big swings to the Conservatives at all levels of government; the last North Warwickshire elections were in 2019 which was a bit before this process really started to gain momentum, but the Tories still won Hartshill with a 49-35 lead over Labour and gained the ward's second seat from Labour.  That second seat went to retired HGV driving instructor Barry Lees, who passed away in April 2022.
</p><p>
Defending for the Conservatives is local resident Marli Parker.  In a straight fight, she is challenged by Labour's Elinor Parsons who stood here in 2019.

<h2>Harbour</h2>
</p><p>
Lancaster council; caused by the death of Labour councillor Janice Hanson.
</p><p>
Andrew's Previews is now starting to wind down for the summer lull.  Late July and August are not popular times for by-elections, as the schools break up and voters head off on their holidays.  After 28 polls in the last three weeks, there are only nine by-elections coming up in the four weeks after today.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/lancaster-harbour.png" alt="Lancaster, Harbour" />
</p><p>
Back in the day many people will have gone on their summer holidays to Morecambe, overlooking the Lancashire coast when the tide is in and the limitless mudflats and sandbanks of Morecambe Bay when it is out.  The Harbour ward - do not be fooled, there is no harbour here - covers the west end of the resort to the south of Morecambe's railway terminus, a series of tightly-packed Victorian terraces near the seafront with interwar housing behind it.  Like many seaside resorts, this area is at the wrong end of the deprivation indices.
</p><p>
Despite that Morecambe is having a bit of a renaissance at the moment, with the successful renovation of the Midland Hotel, a general tidy-up of the town centre and rather a lot of sculpture - the so-called Flock of Words, which has to be seen to believed.  But there is still a lot to do yet.  The Victorian Winter Gardens remains in dire need of restoration, and the Eden Project North - slated for a seafront site next to the Midland Hotel and the Winter Gardens - is waiting on a bid for "levelling-up" funding with work scheduled to start this winter if the bid is successful.
</p><p>
If the Eden Project North works out, then perhaps somebody might be persuaded to do something about the former site of the Frontierland amusement park, which was located within Harbour ward until it closed down in 1999.  Some of Frontierland has been redeveloped for supermarkets and other shopping venues, but there is still a lot of wasteland behind the promenade which has been looking for a new role for decades now.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/lancaster19.png" alt="Lancaster, 2019" />
</p><p>
Morecambe is part of the Lancaster city council area, which also takes in the town of Carnforth and a large rural area at the northern end of modern-day Lancashire.  This is one of those councils which are hung most of the time.  Labour came close to winning a majority here in the 2015 elections, but went backwards in 2019 when the result in terms of seats was 21 Labour, 14 Morecambe Bay Independents (who are effectively a Morecambe localist party), 12 Conservatives, 10 Greens and 3 Lib Dems.  Lancaster is also one of those councils which generates a large number of by-elections: this is the ninth Lancaster council by-election of the current term and the 18th since May 2015, with another one in the pipeline.  There have also been quite a lot of defections recently, so the council website currently lists 15 Labour councillors plus this vacancy, 11 Greens, 9 Conservatives plus another vacancy, 6 Morecambe Bay Independents, 5 councillors in the Independent Group, 4 councillors in the Bay Independent Group (a Morecambe Bay Independents splinter), 4 councillors in the Eco-Socialist Independents and 4 Lib Dems.  A Green-led coalition is running this rather fragmented show.
</p><p>
Despite all this volatility on the council, Harbour ward is safe for Labour.  The ward has had a full slate of Labour councillors since 2011, and the last elections in May 2019 gave 44% to the Labour slate, 31% to the Morecambe Bay Independents and 12% to the Conservatives.  The Morecambe Bay Independents won a seat here in 2007 but have fallen back since.  The ward is part of the Morecambe Central division of Lancashire county council which turned in a very close result last year: the Liberal Democrats came from nowhere to finish just three votes behind Labour, who held the seat by 1,175 votes to 1,172.
</p><p>
The Lib Dems have since won a Morecambe by-election at the other end of the town in Bare ward (<em>Andrew's Previews 2021</em>, page 550), so it will be interesting to see if they can repeat that here.  Bare and Harbour wards have very different demographics, but they do share failed amusement parks: Bare includes the site of the notorious Morecambe Crinkley Bottom, which lasted for just 13 weeks in 1994.  A subsequent failed legal action by Lancaster council cost its taxpayers £2.6 million, with the council found to have acted unlawfully and Noel Edmonds awarded damages of £950,000.  It can pay to go for No Deal sometimes.
</p><p>
Janice Hanson had been a Labour councillor for this ward since 1995, with a break from 1999 to 2003.  She was deputy leader of Lancaster council until 2021 and leader of Morecambe town council until 2019.  Hanson also served on Lancashire county council from 2005 to 2017, chairing the county council in her final year.  Sadly, she passed away in May after suffering a stroke.
</p><p>
Defending the by-election for Labour is the ward's county councillor Margaret Pattison; she was previously a Lancaster councillor for the neighbouring ward of Heysham North, but lost her seat in 2019.  The Morecambe Bay Independents, perhaps reflecting the disarray that has seen more than half of their elected councillors leave the group, have not found a candidate.  The Conservatives have selected Colin Hewitt, who fought Skerton West ward in the 2019 Lancaster elections.  Jake Perkins, of the Lib Dems, completes the ballot paper.
</p><p>
Finally, it would be remiss of me not to leave Morecambe without giving thanks to one of the people responsible for the name of this column.  The remit of Andrew's Previews is to cover all the right votes, but not necessarily in the right order - a misquote of the great and much-missed Eric Morecambe.  In a week when the UK temperature record was broken, let's finish this week on the Morecambe seafront by paying tribute to the man who brought us sunshine.
