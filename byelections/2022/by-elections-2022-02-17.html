There are nine by-elections in England on 17th February 2022, and there is something for everyone to enjoy this week with four seats previously held by independents, two by the Conservatives, and one each by Labour, the Lib Dems and the Green Party.  With no fewer than three free-for-alls for open seats, we can expect a lot of seat changes this week - but what might lie behind those changes?  Read on...

<h2>Stainburn and Clifton</h2>

Allerdale council, Cumbria; caused by the disqualification of independent councillor Janet King, who failed to attend any council meetings in six months.

After last week's three Lib Dem successes in the south of England, this week we're going to start by concentrating on the north and the midlands of England.  Our northern by-election today comes in Cumbria, in a ward which covers four villages immediately to the east of Workington.  Indeed Stainburn, a village next to the River Derwent on the old road from Workington to Cockermouth, was incorporated into Workington in the 1930s and is still part of the town.

The road continues east to the villages of Great Clifton and Little Clifton, where there is a road junction: traffic travelling west to the industrial West Cumbrian coast can either go straight on to Workington or turn left for Whitehaven.  The road to Whitehaven passes through the village of Winscales.

In between these villages can be found the Winscales Moor onshore windfarm, which is capable of supplying energy to power 4,000 homes.  The windfarm promoters donated several thousand pounds towards the renovations of the Great and Little Clifton village halls, both of which are polling stations for today's by-elections.  A third polling station here reflects that energy of a different kind underpins the economy of West Cumbria: the recently-opened Northern Hub of the National College for Nuclear can be found in Winscales, educating the next generation of workers for Sellafield and beyond.  Quite a contrast with our final polling station, serving the voters of Stainburn: this is the Helena Thompson Museum, a large Georgian house which was donated by the late Helena Thompson to the people of Workington and now functions as a museum, venue and community hub.

This ward was created in 2019 from the former Stainburn ward, the former Clifton ward and part of the former Harrington ward.  Since 2011 Stainburn and Clifton had been Labour-voting, while Harrington had split its two seats beteen an independent councillor (Hilary Harrington, in an unusual case of nominative determinism) and Labour.  However, the first election for this ward in 2019 returned two independent councillors, Janet King topping the poll on 42% of the vote.  Labour finished runner-up with 30%, and the Conservatives were third with 17%.

Janet King and her husband David had previously been Labour figures, but they had fallen out with the party shortly beforehand and set up their own independent slate.  This led to some rather unsavoury scenes after the election, when Janet was appointed as mayor of Workington and David as deputy mayor: their political opponents attempted to discredit the Kings by dragging up David's criminal past as a conman who had served two prison sentences in the 2000s for fraud.  David passed away in 2020, and Janet has now moved to Australia to live with her son.

Unfortunately, Allerdale council is not much longer for this world.  Local government reorganisation is in the works, and next year the council is expected to be abolished with its area forming part of a new Cumberland council.  As a result, local services for this area will be administered from faraway Carlisle.  The first Cumberland council elections are due to be held in May using the current Cumbria county council division boundaries, which split this ward into three parts.  Little Clifton is included in the safe Tory county division of Cockermouth South; Winscales is in the Harrington division, which is independent-held; while Great Clifton and Stainburn are part of the St John's and Great Clifton division, which was also independent-held until veteran councillor Joe Holliday died in November 2020.  The resulting by-election in May 2021 was gained by the Conservatives with a majority of just 18 votes over Labour.

And it's in that context that this by-election will be held.  There is no defending independent candidate so we have a free-for-all between Labour and the Conservatives, who both field candidates who were affected by a major administrative cockup arising from four by-elections held in May last year to Workington town council.  On that occasion Labour's Jimmy Grisdale failed to be elected in St John's parish ward (which is not part of this area), while the Conservatives' Jacqueline Kirkbride won the seat in Stainburn parish ward vacated by David King's death.  Because of COVID restrictions Kirkbride and the three other town council by-election winners in May failed to sign their declarations of acceptance of office between their results being declared on 7 May 2021 and the following town council meeting on 11 May, and it was subsequently ruled that their seats were vacant.  All four by-elections were rerun on 16th December, with Kirkbride and the others three previous winners all being re-elected.  Jimmy Grisdale for Labour and Jacqueline Kirkbride for the Conservatives now face off in a straight fight for election to the district council.

<h2>Park</h2>

North East Lincolnshire council; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Debbie Woodward.

We now cross over to the eastern side of England to the town of Grimsby.  This place gets a bad press, but even towns like Grimsby have to have a nice area to live.  And Park ward is it.  This ward covers the Wellow area south of the town centre, with Grimsby Town station lying on the northern boundary; the ward extends south to take in the Diana, Princess of Wales Hospital and the Grimsby Institute, a large further education college.  At the centre of the ward is People's Park, a small but perfectly-formed park dating from 1883.

Now, let's put away those tired old clichês about the Red Wall please.  Park ward has had some seriously volatile voting patterns in recent years, with all three main parties and UKIP having had significant levels of support here for most of the 2010s.  However, this is consistently one of the weakest Labour wards in Grimsby.  Since the current North East Lincolnshire ward boundaries were introduced in 2003 Park ward has only voted Labour once, in 2012, and on that occasion their winning score was just 29% on a freak vote split.  Apart from that, the Lib Dems finished first in every election here up to 2018, when Park ward started to vote Conservative.

The Tories have now consolidated their position in Park ward, gaining the last Lib Dem seat in May very convincingly.  Shares of the vote on that occasion were 53% for the Conservatives, 25% for Labour and just 16% for the Lib Dems who were defending the seat.  53% is the highest winning score in this ward since 2004, when the Lib Dems polled 75% in a straight fight with Labour.

Debbie Woodward passed away in December, having suffered from bowel cancer for some years.  She kept working for her constituents all the way to the end, turning up for an online meeting on ward funding just a week before her death.  Woodward had gained her seat from the Lib Dems in 2019, so the winner of this by-election will serve until May next year.

Defending for the Conservatives is Marian Boyd.  Labour have reselected Kevin Shutt who was runner-up here last year.  The Lib Dem candidate Ryan Aisthorpe, who runs a design consultancy, will be hoping to join his wife Nicola on the council.  Completing the ballot paper is Dave Mitchell for the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition.  The Local Democracy Reporting Service have interviewed all the candidates, and you can find out more here (<a href="https://thelincolnite.co.uk/2022/02/grimsby-council-by-election-meet-the-candidates/">link</a>).

<h2>Collingham</h2>

Nottinghamshire county council; and

<h2>Collingham</h2>

Newark and Sherwood council, Nottinghamshire; both caused by the death of independent councillor Maureen Dobson in December last year.

From Grimsby we sail up the Humber estuary and turn left to float up the River Trent.  Initially this is Lincolnshire on both banks, but then the Trent passes into Nottinghamshire.  The Collingham ward covers all the villages in Nottinghamshire which lie on the east bank of the Trent north of Newark: this area is rather cut off from the rest of the county, as downstream of Newark there are only five road and two rail bridges over the river.  Two of those road bridges (the A57 at Dunham on Trent, and the Humber Bridge) are subject to tolls.  The village of Collingham itself lies on the railway line from Newark to Lincoln and on the road between Newark and Gainsborough.

The county division is rather larger than the Newark and Sherwood district ward of the same name, taking in additionally the village of Coddington to the east of Newark and a fair chunk of Newark town.  This is most of Bridge ward, the north-east corner of the town along the road towards Lincoln.  Newark Northgate railway station, a stop for intercity trains on the East Coast main line, is on the county division boundary.

The local politics of this area has been dominated by independent councillor Maureen Dobson for decades.  She was first elected to Newark and Sherwood council in a by-election all the back in July 1978, and had continuous service since 1999.  Originally Dobson was a Conservative figure, but she had been elected as an independent since 2011.  She was also an independent on Nottinghamshire county council, to which she was first elected in 2013.

The last Newark and Sherwood elections were in 2019, and Dobson topped the poll in Collingham ward that year with a massive personal vote: 1,835 ballot papers were issued in that year, of which 1,419 (77%) cast a vote for Maureen Dobson.  Collingham elects two members of Newark and Sherwood council, but the Conservative candidate who won the other seat (Linda Dales) polled only just over half Dobson's total.

Dobson and Dales faced off again in last year's county elections, but on this occasion only one of them could win.  Forced to make a choice, the electors chose Dobson by a 50-40 margin.  Despite that the Conservatives gained overall control of Nottinghamshire county council last year, and they currently hold 36 out of 67 seats.

Of the parts of the county division not in Collingham ward, Coddington is part of the safe-Conservative ward of Balderton North and Coddington; while Bridge ward re-elected two independent councillors in 2019.  Both independent councillors resigned in 2021, so Andrew's Previews was in Newark last July: the resulting double by-election was gained by the Conservatives.  The whole area is part of the Newark parliamentary seat held by Robert Jenrick, who managed the rare feat of performing so badly as a Cabinet minister that he was sacked from the Johnson cabinet last year.

Two of the candidates from last year's Bridge ward double by-election return for another go here, this time at county level.  The defending independent candidate for the Collingham county division is Debbie Darby, a voluntary worker and charity fundraiser who finished fourth in Bridge last July.  Top of the poll on that occasion was Jack Kellas of the Conservatives, a recent former member of the Youth Parliament who now has the chance to double up at district and county level.  Jennifer Kaye completes the ballot paper as the division's first Labour candidate since 2013.

The district by-election is a free-for-all with no defending independent candidate.  The Conservatives have selected Emma Davis, who is a trustee of the Collingham and District Preschool.  The Lib Dem candidate is Phil Barron, a psychiatrist, and Labour again stand here for the first time in some years with their candidate Matthew Spoors.

<h2>Wigston Meadowcourt</h2>

Oadby and Wigston council, Leicestershire; caused by the death of Liberal Democrat councillor Robert Eaton.

We stay in the East Midlands for our Liberal Democrat defence this week.  Like the Evington by-election in Leicester a couple of weeks back, we are on the edge of the Leicester built-up area here although the locals would probably prefer me not to say that.  Wigston may now be indistinguishable from the urban sprawl, but it has never been incorporated into Leicester.  Instead it forms one-half of the Oadby and Wigston local government district, which consists of those two Leicester suburbs and nothing else.

The Meadowcourt ward covers the Wigston Magna and Wigston Harcourt areas at the southern end of the urban area, most of which consists of postwar housing developments.  It's a rather upmarket area.  In the 2011 census 18.5% of its workforce were employed in "intermediate" occupations, which was the third-highest figure for any ward in the East Midlands.

Oadby and Wigston council has been controlled by the Liberal Democrats for many years with large majorities.  Wigston Meadowcourt is one of the stronger Conservative wards in the district and was the only ward in either Oadby or Wigston to return a full slate of Tory councillors in 2007.  However, the last Conservative seat here disappeared in 2019, when the Lib Dems won here by a 52-34 margin.  Robert Eaton, who passed away between Christmas and New Year, had served as a councillor here since 2011.

The Lib Dems do have work to do to hold this one.  Almost all of this ward is covered by the East Wigston division of Leicestershire county council, which the Tories came just 98 votes short of winning last year.  The task of defence falls to Lib Dem candidate Mick Phillips, who is semi-retired after a career as a police officer and senior manager at Wilkos.  The Conservatives have reselected Liz Darling, who was runner-up here in the 2019 Oadby and Wigston council elections and the 2021 county council elections.  Completing the ballot paper is Joshua Pearman for the Green Party.

<h2>Oundle</h2>

North Northamptonshire council; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Annabel de Capell Brooke.

It's time for Andrew's Previews to return to Northamptonshire for the first time in a very long time.  This is the first Northamptonshire council by-election of this Parliament, and the first time this column has written about the county in any detail since 24th October 2019.

The reason for that is the grotesque spectacle of a Tory council - <em>a Tory council</em> - running out of money.  That was the fate of Northamptonshire county council, which issued not one but two Section 114 notices in 2018 banning all non-essential expenditure.  The cause?  Gross financial mismanagement, which left an effective bailout followed by reorganisation of the county's local government as the only realistic way forward.

Northamptonshire county council was finally dissolved in April 2021.  The district councils under it, in a case of what appears to be collateral damage, were abolished then as well.  The 2019 Northamptonshire district council elections were cancelled, and the pandemic then forced the cancellation of the intended 2020 elections to the successor councils of West Northamptonshire and North Northamptonshire.

At the tiller of the good ship <em>Northamptonshire</em> while it was hitting the iceberg was Heather Smith, the Conservative leader of the county council.  Following a scathing report into what had happened on her watch, she recognised that her position was untenable and resigned as leader.  Shortly afterwards she resigned from the county council, prompting its last by-election in Oundle in February 2019 (<em>Andrew's Previews 2019</em>, page 38).

Which bring us to Oundle, a town on the main road between Northampton and Peterborough and rather closer to Peterborough, which is the main service for the area.  Oundle is known for its public school, which was founded in 1556; this is the third-largest boarding school in England (after Millfield and, inevitably, Eton), and that has an effect on the town's census return.  The former Oundle ward of the former East Northamptonshire council was in the top 30 wards in England and Wales for the 16-17 age bracket; of course, with the exception of some of the sixth form those pupils will be too young to vote.

The local authority here is now North Northamptonshire council, which took over the former districts of Corby, Kettering, East Northamptonshire and Wellingborough and is based in Kettering.  For the 2021 elections North Northamptonshire reused the former Northamptonshire county council divisions as its wards, with each ward returning three councillors.  The resulting Oundle ward covers a large chunk of countryside west of Peterborough which runs to the edges of Stamford and Corby: nineteen parishes in all.  Most of this was the royal hunting territory of Rockingham Forest, and within the boundary is the site of Fotheringhay castle, where Richard III was born and Mary, Queen of Scots was beheaded.

The present boundaries of the Oundle ward date from 2013 when it was drawn up for the former Northamptonshire county council.  Annabel de Capell Brooke had been elected to the county council in the 2019 by-election following the resignation of Heather Smith, weathering a sharp swing to the Lib Dems.  She had also won a by-election to East Northamptonshire council two years earlier (<em>Andrew's Previews 2017</em>, page 111).  de Capell Brooke topped the poll in the first elections to North Northamptonshire council in May last year, in which the Conservative slate polled 43% against 25% for the Lib Dems and 14% for Labour.

Annabel de Capell Brooke now lives in Norfolk, and resigned after attracting controversy for poor attendance at meetings.  She had also been awarded a special responsibility allowance of £333 per month as chair of the council's employment committee - which, at the time of her resignation from the council in December, had yet to meet.  Given the history of financial mismanagement at the former Northamptonshire county council, this is not a promising start to the county's brave new local government world.

Defending for the Conservatives is Ollie Curtis, who lives and is a town councillor in Raunds around twelve miles south of Oundle: he is the head of technical sales at a global telecoms and IT company.  The Lib Dems have reselected Charlie Best who was runner-up here last year.  Also back from last year is the Labour candidate Harry James, who lives in the village of Kings Cliffe in Rockingham Forest.  Kate Jones completes the ballot paper for the Green Party.  The BBC have interviewed all the candidates, and you can find out more here (<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-60306083">link</a>).

<h2>Thurston</h2>

Mid Suffolk council; caused by the resignation of Green Party councillor Wendy Turner.

We now cross over to East Anglia.  Thurston is a large village roughly in the centre of Suffolk, a few miles to the east of Bury St Edmunds.  This was an important place in mediaeval times as the centre of Thedwastre Hundred, one of the ancient hundreds of Suffolk; "Theodward's Tree", which no longer exists today, stood in Thurston.

Modern local administration in Thedwastre is based in the Cavendish Hall, which is home to the parish council and is a polling station for today's by-election.  It was gifted to the people of Thurston in 1913 by Julia Cavendish, an American who had married a British businessman called Tyrell Cavendish.  The Cavendishes had bought the hall just before embarking to America as first-class passengers on the maiden voyage of the RMS <em>Titanic</em>.  Julia was rescued from one of the ship's lifeboats, but Tyrell didn't survive the disaster.

Thurston and four other parishes around it form part of Mid Suffolk council, whose largest town is Stowmarket although the council offices are based closer to Ipswich in Needham Market.  Mid Suffolk council is currently hung, with the Conservatives and an independent councillor forming an administration which controls half of the 34 seats.  A Conservative gain here will give that party half of the seats and the administration a majority, so this by-election is crucial.  The main opposition comes from the Green Party, which won 12 seats at the 2019 Mid Suffolk elections and performed particularly well in the village-based wards around Stowmarket.  Recent by-elections have shown some evidence that the Greens can perform well in rural wards in the south of England; this trend appears to be rather more advanced in Suffolk.

In Thurston ward the Greens topped the poll in 2019 with 39% of the vote, winning one seat.  The Conservatives polled 34% and won the other seat, with the Lib Dems scoring 11%.  The ward is split between the two Thedwastre divisions of Suffolk county council, which both turned in close results last year: Thurston itself is in Thedwastre South, which the Lib Dems narrowly held, while the villages in the ward along the A1088 Stowarket-Thetford road are in Thedwastre North which the Greens narrowly gained.  So don't just look at the nice countryside and assume that this by-election will be just another easy rural Tory win.

Wendy Turner resigned from the council in December, having relocated to Sheffield to be closer to her family.  Defending for the Green Party is Austin Davies.  The Conservatives have selected Philippa Wilding, who is a senior clinical manager in the NHS.  The Lib Dem candidate is Timothy Glenton, who works in finance.  Completing the ballot paper is Terence Wilson for Labour.

<h2>Southmead</h2>

Bristol city council; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Helen Godwin Teige.

One thing you're not going to see much of in this column over the next month or two is any discussion of by-elections in Labour-held wards.  The Southmead by-election today is the third and last Labour defence of February 2022, and the only Labour by-election after today with a confirmed date is, at the time of writing, the parliamentary by-election in Birmingham Erdington in two weeks' time.  There are a number of vacant council Labour seats at the moment, but it seems that many of them may be being saved up for combination with the main local elections in May.

So, savour this one while you can.  Despite the compass point in the name Southmead can be found at the northern end of the Bristol city council area, although this is by no means the northern end of the built-up area.  However, there is at least a golf course separating Southmead from the town of Filton to the north-east.  This area was developed by Bristol Corporation in the 1930s and 1950s to house people who had been cleared out of slums in the city centre, and there is still a lot of council housing here and a bad reputation for antisocial behaviour.  Southmead makes the top 40 wards in England and Wales for those employed in health and social work; this is due to the presence of the large Southmead Hospital, which lies outside the boundary in the neighbouring Horfield ward.

This is a safe Labour area.  The party has lost Southmead ward only once this century, to the Lib Dems in 2009 in what appears to be something of a freak result.  In the 2021 elections here the winning Labour slate polled 43% against 28% for the Conservatives and 19% for the Green Party.

Bristol stopped using thirds elections in 2016, so there will be no ordinary council elections here in May: however, there will be a referendum on whether to keep the elected mayoralty currently held by Labour's Marvin Rees.  On the council Labour and the Greens are currently tied for first place on 24 seats each; a gain for the Greens would see them become the largest party.

Outgoing councillor Helen Godwin had joined Rees' cabinet in 2018, with the education and children portfolio.  She stepped down from the cabinet in August last year after getting a new job with PricewaterhouseCoopers, the management consultants, and she resigned from the council altogether in December to concentrate on her employment.

Until May last year Godwin served on Marvin Rees' cabinet alongside Kye Dudd, who was the cabinet member for transport and planning.  Unfortunately Dudd's re-election campaign misfired, and he lost his seat in Central ward last year.  He is seeking to bounce back as the defending Labour candidate for this by-election.  The Conservatives, who hold the local parliamentary seat of Bristol North West, have selected Roddy Jaques who works an NHS statistician.  The Green candidate is Edward Burnham, who is an engineer.  Also standing are Gill Brooks for the Liberal Democrats and Tom Baldwin for the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition.

<h2>Tavistock North</h2>

West Devon council; caused by the resignation of independent councillor Steve Hipsey.

As usual, the last entry of the week is in the West Country.  We have come to the town of Tavistock, around fifteen miles north of Plymouth.  This town has a long history with a surprising amount of industry involved, and it's that industry which put Tavistock on the UNESCO World Heritage list - for the mining landscape of Cornwall and West Devon.  There's not gold, but there is metal in them there hills, and Tavistock was successively a centre for the stannaries and then, from the early nineteenth century, copper mining.

The nearby Devon Great Consols mine was the most productive copper mine in the world for much of the nineteenth century, and its owner (the Duke of Bedford) made so much money from it that he was able to essentially rebuild Tavistock's town centre.  Unfortunately, with all that money came a big liability for death duties, and the Bedfords were forced to sell up in 1911.  One result of that is that Tavistock town council is a very rich parish council indeed.  The modern Tavistock parish and this ward takes in areas which are part of the Dartmoor National Park, and that gives a clue to the modern economic mainstay of this area: tourism.

Tavistock is home to the small West Devon district council, and it's a remote enough place that the candidate can matter more than the party.  North ward has returned Conservative, Lib Dem and independent councillors this century.  Readers of Andrew's Previews with extremely long memories may remember a by-election covered here in March 2012, in which a 20-year-old Conservative councillor resigned over inappropriate Facebook comments and the Tories lost the resulting by-election to an independent, Jeff Moody.  Another Tory seat then fell vacant almost immediately, but the Conservatives held the resulting by-election in June 2012.

The 2019 West Devon elections returned a full slate of three independent councillors as the Tories lost two seats in Tavistock North.  Top of the poll was Jeffrey Boyd-Moody, to give him his full name, who polled 48% of the vote; the Lib Dems finished second on 19%, Labour were third on 18% and the Conservatives fell to last place.  Despite that they do still have a majority on West Devon council, but only a small one: 16 seats out of 31.  A gain here might give them some breathing space.  The Tories have since put in much better performances in the 2021 Devon county elections, in which Tavistock is a safe Conservative division, and in the 2019 general election where this part of the Torridge and West Devon constituency represented by Geoffrey Cox.  You'd think he might have a few bob to put towards this campaign.

There is no defending independent candidate, so we have our third and final free-for-all of the week!  The Lib Dems have re-selected Tavistock town councillor Peter Squire, who was a rather distant runner-up here in 2019.  Labour have changed candidate to Doug Smith, who has spent his career in land management for the Ministry of Defence; in last year's Devon county elections he fought Hatherleigh and Chagford division, a long way to the north.  The Conservatives have selected David Turnbull, who is an estate agent.  Completing the ballot paper is Susan Bamford for the Green Party.
