Ten polls on 7th July 2022:

<h2>Hollingwood and Inkersall</h2>

Chesterfield council, Derbyshire; caused by the resignation of independent councillor Mick Bagshaw.

After last week's Super Thursday, have another one: there are ten polls taking place today.  Unlike last week's selection which had a definite Northern bias, this week it's the turn of London and the South East: there are five polls inside the M25 and only one by-election taking place north of the Watford Gap today.  So let's start with that one.

So it is that we travel up the M1 motorway to Derbyshire.  Hollingwood and Inkersall ward lies to the east of Chesterfield proper, and is a rather curiously-drawn ward winding around the south of the town of Staveley.  The whole ward is within Staveley parish, and it consists of three separate urban centres.

Closest to Chesterfield is Hollingwood, which lies on the main road from Chesterfield to Worksop.  This was a very industrial place back in the day, as Hollingwood overlooks the site of the massive Staveley chemical works.  The chemicals factories have all gone now, but some of the site survived into the 2010s and gave the 2011 census return for this ward a very working-class profile.  There had been a plan for redevelopment of the chemicals site as a depot for the eastern leg of High Speed 2, but this would appear to have fallen by the wayside.  Levelling-up in action, there.

Inkersall Green lies to the south of Hollingwood and is effectively a southern extension of Staveley.  To the east is a large collection of rather new buildings on the site of the former Markham Colliery, a huge coal-mining complex which survived until 1993.  Markham claimed a large number of lives in its century of operation, with major underground explosions in 1937 and 1938 followed by a 1973 disaster in which a winding engine's brakes failed, killing 18 miners.  It was the last deep coal mine in Derbyshire.  The regeneration effort has given us a new business park next to the village of Duckmanton, with a new junction on the M1 motorway (junction 29A) opening in 2008 to serve it.

This area doesn't have the politics normally associated with coalfield areas, because it's included within the borough of Chesterfield which has long had Lib Dem strength at local level.  The Liberal Democrats held the Chesterfield parliamentary seat from 2001 to 2010 and controlled Chesterfield council from 2003 to 2011.  Hollingwood and Inkersall ward was part of the Lib Dem majority during this period.

The ward's three Lib Dem councillors from 2003 to 2011 were Mick Bagshaw, Paul Mann and Ruth Perry.  After losing their seats to Labour in 2011 they didn't give up; but they did leave the party, contesting the 2015 and 2019 elections as an independent slate.  In 2019 Bagshaw, Mann and Perry won their seats back, gaining Hollingwood and Inkersall ward from Labour by the convincing margin of 53-33.  This was the only ward of Chesterfield not to return Labour or Lib Dem councillors in 2019: the council elections that year returned 28 Labour councillors, 17 Lib Dems and these three independents.

All three independent councillors went on to stand in the 2021 Derbyshire county council elections.  Ruth Perry contested the safe-Labour Brimington division, which includes Hollingwood, and finished in a poor fifth and last place with 2.9%.  Mick Bagshaw and Paul Mann stood against each other in the Staveley division, which covers Inkersall and Duckmanton, and they split the independent vote allowing Labour to come through the middle and hold the seat: vote shares in Staveley last year were 31% for Labour, 29% for Mann, 21% for Bagshaw and 19% for the Conservatives.  The Tory party performed very well in north-eastern Derbyshire in 2021 gaining all sorts of unlikely-looking divisions around Staveley, but they are so weak in Chesterfield borough that they haven't even managed to find a candidate for this by-election.

Bagshaw tendered his resignation from the council at the start of June.  One independent candidate has come forward to replace him: he is Dean Rhodes, who represents Inkersall Green ward on Staveley town council.  The Labour candidate is Debbie Wheeldon.  Completing the ballot paper is Louis Hollingworth, who is the first local election canididate here for the Green Party.

<h2>Charlwood</h2>

Councillor resigns from Charlwood years into term, replacement wanted (7, 7).

We now come to the only seat the Conservatives are defending this week, which is rather odd given that there are five polls today in the South East region or the Home Counties.  The village of Charlwood lies on the southern boundary of Surrey, and thereby hangs a tale.

Charlwood lies immediately outside the northern boundary of Gatwick Airport, which is one of the busiest airports in Europe and drives the area's economy.  In particular, Gatwick is the major employer for the New Town of Crawley, a few miles to the south of Charlwood.  However, before the 1970s the airport lay within Charlwood parish and was therefore part of the county of Surrey, while Crawley was over the county line within Sussex.

The 1974 reorganisation of England's local governemnt intended to sort this out by  transferring Charlwood and the nearby town of Horley into the county of West Sussex, where they would form part of the district based on Crawley.  This went down so badly in Charlwood and Horley that the government was forced into a last-minute U-turn, resulting in the Charlwood and Horley Act 1974 which is still on the statute book today.  The effect of the Act was that Gatwick Airport itself would be transferred to West Sussex but
Charlwood and Horley would remain in Surrey; Horley became part of the Reigate and Banstead district, while the rump of Charlwood parish was tacked onto the new district of Mole Valley which is administered from Dorking.

The new county boundary was carefully drawn around the airport perimeter, but Charlwood ward does include the Gatwick Aviation Museum near the village itself and a number of large airport hotels in the village of Hookwood, behind Gatwick's north terminal.  Also here is Farmfield Hospital, a secure unit treating male patients detained under the Mental Health Act.  Farmfield has a long history as an asylum, having been originally opened in 1900 by the London County Council under the Inebriates Act 1898, as a reformatory for habitual drunkards.

Charlwood ward has had unchanged boundaries since 1976, returning an independent councillor until 1995 (without Conservative opposition) and Conservatives since 1999.  From 2011 onwards the ward's councillor was Charles Yarwood, who has resigned after eleven years in office.  Yarwood was last re-elected in May 2019 in an unusually close result for the ward: he polled 46% against 28% for the Green Party and 14% for UKIP.

We have now gone through almost a whole electoral cycle of terrible local election results for the Surrey Conservatives, which started in 2019 when the Tories lost 120 council seats in the county.  Mole Valley has historically been one of the weaker Conservative districts in Surrey because there has always been a large bloc of independent councillors here, and the Liberal Democrats have been active since the 1990s; hung councils have been the norm in this district.  However, in 2019 Charlwood was one of only two wards which the Conservatives won across the whole district; they lost ten seats in Mole Valley that year, nine of them going to the Liberal Democrats who have had majority control of the council since.  (They had only previously had majority control for one year, 1994-95.)  Following further Conservative losses in the May 2022 Mole Valley elections there are now 24 Liberal Democrat councillors, 9 Conservatives plus this vacancy, and 7 independent councillors for the town of Ashtead.  Suddenly that 18-point majority in Charlwood from May 2019 looks a bit shaky.

Defending for the Conservatives is Corinna Osborne-Patterson, who is looking to make a quick return to the council after losing her seat in May in the neighbouring ward of Capel, Leigh and Newdigate.  The Green candidate is local resident Lisa Scott, who fought the local county council division (Dorking Rural) last year.  UKIP have not returned, so completing the ballot paper are Mike Ward for the Lib Dems and the ward's first Labour candidate since 2000, Laurence Nasskau.

<h2>De Beauvoir</h2>

Hackney council, London; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Tom Dewey.

We now finally enter Greater London for two early by-elections to the new London borough councils, which were only elected two months ago.  The curious name of De Beauvoir ward comes from the de Beauvoir family, who were the landowners here in the 1820s when a developer, William Rhodes, decided to make some money by building spacious new houses for the upper classes a few miles north of the City.  He was spurred on by the opening of the Regent's Canal, which had made the area accessible for development.

Unfortunately the whole project got mired in legal trouble over Rhodes' lease which occupied the courts for years, and by the time this was sorted out the upper classes were no longer interested in moving to Hackney.  So De Beavoir Town ended up as scaled-down housing for the middle classes, with some industry around the canal.  Not all of the Victorian Jacobethan-style terraces survive: parts of De Beauvoir Town have been redeveloped for council housing, with the De Beauvoir Estate in the south-west corner of the ward including five large tower blocks.  Opposition from residents saved the rest of the area from the wrecking ball, and much of the rest of the ward is now a conservation area.

There has been a De Beauvoir ward continuously since Hackney borough was created in the 1960s, and in the 2011 census the ward made a number of England and Wales Top 100 lists: 22nd for those employed in the professional, scientific and technical sector (20.3%), 27th for households in shared ownership (5.2%), 90th for mixed-race population (6.8%).  Parts of the ward had unusually large Turkish and Nigerian populations.  At the time De Beauvoir extended over the Regent's Canal into Shoreditch: this area was removed by boundary changes in 2014 which also cut the number of councillors from three to two.

De Beauvoir Town may have been built as housing for the middle classes but there is certainly a radical political history here.  In 1907 the Brotherhood Church, a building on Southgate Road (the western boundary of this ward) which no longer exists today, was the venue for the Fifth Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party which was attended by Lenin, Stalin, Trotsky and a host of other Russian Communist figures, all trying to work out their strategy for a Communist revolution in Russia.  The modern politics of De Beauvoir is also left-wing, and this is a safe Labour ward.  In May the Labour slate polled 57% of the vote here, with the Greens' 22% best of the rest.  The Conservatives had no candidate here in May but were on the ballot in the 2021 GLA elections, with Sadiq Khan defeating Shaun Bailey here 57-15 and the London Members ballot going 49% Labour, 19% Green and 13% Conservative.  There's not much live for Communism in De Beauvoir now: the Communist list polled just ten votes here last year in the London Members vote.

The voters here are being called out again so soon after May's London borough elections because newly-elected Labour councillor Tom Dewey resigned less than two weeks into his term of office.  Dewey had previously been an important figure in Hackney Labour, as the election agent for the local MP Dame Meg Hillier.

Defending this by-election for Labour is Joe Walker, who is the co-founder of a charity for street children called Street Action; he contested Springfield ward, a heavily Jewish area of Hackney, in 2018 but failed to dislodge the Conservatives there.  The Green candidate is Tyrone Scott, who fought the neighbouring Dalston ward in May and is also seeking the deputy leadership of the Green Party of England and Wales in a separate election at the moment; Dalston elected one Green councillor two months ago, but it wasn't Scott.  Also standing are Thrusie Maurseth-Cahill for the Lib Dems, Kelly Reid for the Independent Network, Kristal Bayliss for the Women's Equality Party and Oliver Hall for the Conservatives.
