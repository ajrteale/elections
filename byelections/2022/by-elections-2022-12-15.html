<h2>Stretford and Urmston</h2>

It all started with the Traffords.  In the late 19th century, Trafford Park was a ``beautifully timbered deer park'' owned and controlled by the de Trafford family.  The Traffords go back to the invasion of Cnut in 1016, at which one of the Vikings---a warrior called Rafe or Ranulph---distinguished himself in fighting on the banks of the Irwell and was subsequently granted the land in that area by Cnut.  The Traffords emerged intact from the subsequent Saxon restoration and the Norman Conquest and were still owning land in the area well into the nineteenth century.  The present head of the family, Sir John de Trafford, 7th Baronet, is a businessman and banker and former chairman of National Savings and Investments.

What changed this was the Manchester Ship Canal, which made the River Irwell---the northern boundary of Trafford Park---navigable.  Sir Humphrey de Trafford, 2nd Baronet, was an implacable opponent of the canal.  Even though the Ship Canal company constructed a nine-foot high wall to block the view of the canal from the Trafford Park estate, and built two wharves for the exclusive use of the de Trafford family, it wasn't enough.  The canal opened for business in 1894; two years later Sir Humphrey de Trafford, 3rd Baronet, put the park up for sale.  After Trafford Park failed to reach its reserve price at auction, Sir Humphrey negotiated a sale to Ernest Hooley for Â£360,000.  Hooley is best remembered these days as a fraudster, and this was his most profitable deal: he quickly got the Ship Canal directors on board as a major investor, and the result was the development of Trafford Park as the UK's largest industrial estate.

Just seven years after Trafford Park was sold, around 12,000 people were working there.  Half of them were employed at the British Westinghouse factory which made turbines and electric generators.  There was also food manufacturing: the Cooperative Wholesale Society quickly erected a flour mill next to the Ship Canal, and the Kellogg's cornflake factory was opened in 1938 by Florence Millward, winner of a competition to find Britain's typical housewife.  In 1909 some land on the eastern edge of Trafford Park was developed for a new football stadium for Manchester United football club, who played their first match at Old Trafford in February 1910: a 4--3 loss to Liverpool.  All of this industry was serviced by a large private railway network, and abandoned railway tracks still litter Trafford Park today.

The business rates generated by Trafford Park didn't accrue to Manchester Corporation, which represents a missed opportunity for the city.  The Corporation had failed to buy Trafford Park when it was put on the market in 1896, and also failed in an attempt to annex the local authority (then Stretford Urban District) in 1902.  Instead it was Stretford, an old market town on the Roman road towards Chester, which benefited from all this industry.  The major municipal result of this was the Stretford Mall, a large shopping centre built in the 1960s in Stretford town centre and now lying half-empty.  Its main replacement, the Trafford Centre next to the M\,60 motorway, is also showing scars from the slow death of Britain's high street retail sector.

The motorway marks the transition between Stretford and Urmston, which has a rather different history: Urmston is a late-Victorian middle-class railway suburb along the line from Manchester towards Warrington and Liverpool.  Further out again, on the far side of the River Mersey, is the chemicals town of Partington which was created from almost nothing in 1894 as a port on the Ship Canal for Lancashire coal exports, and was greatly expanded after the Second World War by Manchester overspill.  With Partington's rail link having closed long ago, this is an isolated and deprived town.

Stretford was given a constituency of its own in 1885, but the Stretford constituency of those days had very different boundaries to the current seat: it wrapped around the south of Manchester as Manchester existed in 1885, and as such took in areas such as Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Levenshulme, Rusholme, Withington and Reddish.  By 1918 everything in the seat except Stretford itself had been annexed by Manchester or (in the case of Reddish and Heaton Norris) by Stockport.  As such this was a suburban constituency whose electorate saw huge growth during this period: from 11,140 at the 1885 election to 27,629 in December 1910.

The first MP for Stretford was the Liberal William Agnew, who had previously represented the South-East Lancashire constituency since 1880.  Agnew was one of the Sons in Thomas Agnew and Sons, the London fine art dealership which during this period became the go-to firm for sales of Old Masters.  He defeated John Maclure of the Conservatives by 4,866 votes to 4,676, a majority of 190.

Maclure got his revenge the following year, defeating Agnew by 739 votes.  One of the prime movers of Conservatism in the Manchester area at the time, Maclure was a businessman in the insurance industry and had also been involved in the relief efforts during the 1860s Lancashire cotton famine.  In 1892 he increased his majority over Agnew to 1,345, and nobody bothered to oppose his re-election in 1895.  He was made a baronet in 1898.

Sir John Maclure died in 1901, aged 65, and is commemorated by a stained-glass window in Manchester Cathedral; helpfully in this regard, his brother was the Dean of Manchester.  The resulting Stretford by-election of February 1901 was held for the Conservatives by another prominent Anglican, Charles Cripps.  The father of the Labour politician Sir Stafford Cripps, Charles was a barrister who had previously served in the 1895 parliament as Conservative MP for Stroud; he had lost his seat in 1900, so this was a quick return to the green benches for him.  During his tenure as MP for Stretford Cripps was appointed as attorney-general to the Prince of Wales, the future George V (he had served the future Edward VII in the same capacity) and became Vicar-General of Canterbury, concentrating on church affairs.  He later served as MP for Wycombe from 1910 and was promoted to the House of Lords in 1914 as Lord Parmoor, serving on the Lords' judicial committee despite having never been a judge.  Parmoor ended up in the Labour Party, and was Leader of the Lords in both Macdonald governments.

All this lay in the future in 1906, when the Liberal landslide swept Charles Cripps away as MP for Stretford.  The new Liberal MP for the seat was Harry Nuttall, an import and export merchant who was president of the Manchester Chamber of Commerce in 1905, and who had strong support from the 5,000 Manchester freeholders who were eligible to vote in the Stretford county constituency.  Nuttall had got nowhere against John Maclure in 1900, but he pulled off a swing of nearly 18\% to unseat Cripps with a majority of 2,824.  He was re-elected in both 1910 elections, although his majority fell to 876 in December 1910.  Arthur Samuel, the defeated Conservative candidate here in both 1910 polls who later had a prominent government career between the wars, polled 10,467 votes in December which would have won nearly any other constituency.

During this period Urmston formed part of the Eccles parliamentary constituency, to which it was connected by the Barton swing bridges over the Ship Canal (the present motorway bridge was many years in the future).  The 1918 redistribution cut back the Eccles seat to cover just Eccles, Swinton and Pendlebury, while something needed to be done about the Stretford seat as most of its voters had ended up in Manchester or Stockport constituencies.  The solution was to marry together these two unwanted areas into a new Stretford constituency which straddled the Ship Canal: on the south side were Stretford, Urmston, Davyhulme and Flixton, on the north side were Barton Moss, Irlam and Astley.  Irlam was another inland port and industrial centre created by the Ship Canal, opposite Partington and in a similar vein; Astley was a pit village on the edge of Chat Moss, while Barton Moss had a small population.

Henry Nuttall elected to retire in 1918, and the new Stretford constituency was a very different political fight.  In the left corner was the Labour candidate Joseph Hallsworth, who at the time was secretary of the Amalgamated Union of Co-operative Employees and who would later become the first secretary-general of its successor USDAW.  In the right corner was the overwhelming winner Thomas Robinson, a businessman in the dyeing trade who had served on Stretford urban district council since its formation in 1894.

Thomas Robinson's party affiliation is complicated.  Officially he was a right-wing independent candidate, but he had the Coalition coupon in 1918 and in practice he was often endorsed by the Liberals and took their whip in Parliament.  In 1924 he successfully sought re-election as a Constitutionalist candidate; this was a label normally used by Unionists, but the relevant \emph{Times Guide} described his re-election as ``no change'' from 1923, when the Liberals had endorsed him.  His last re-election in 1929 was as a \emph{bona fide} independent candidate, with a comfortable majority over Labour.

Robinson retired from the Commons in 1931, although he kept going in local politics and went on to serve twice as Mayor of Stretford.  The 1931 election in Stretford was a straight fight between the Conservatives and Labour, with the Tories' Gustav Renwick winning very easily.  Renwick was an industrialist with a number of business interests and a sideline in hare-coursing and greyhound breeding.  Many years later, he was the winning owner at the 1953 Waterloo Cup.

Gustav Renwick served one term in the Commons before handing the Stretford seat on in 1935 to the Tories' Anthony Crossley.  A grandson of Sir William Crossley, the former Liberal MP for Altrincham and a founder of the engineering firm Crossley Brothers, Anthony was in his early 30s and had made his mark as a writer and publisher.  He had also competed at the Wimbledon tennis championships in 1931 and 1932, on the latter occasion after being elected as one of the two MPs for Oldham.  Stretford was a much safer Conservative seat than Oldham, and Crossley could have expected a long Parliamentary career.

It wasn't to be.  On 15 August 1939 Anthony Crossley was one of four passengers on a British Airways flight from Hendon Aerodrome to Copenhagen which caught fire in mid-air and ditched into the water off the coast of Denmark.  The co-pilot was the only survivor; the pilot and all four passengers died.

The resulting Stretford by-election in December 1939 took place during the wartime political truce, but the Conservatives were challenged by a Communist candidate and an Independent Labour Party candidate (Bob Edwards, who later had a long parliamentary career as a Labour MP in the West Midlands).  Neither of them got anywhere near the Conservative candidate Ralph Etherton, who had had two previous failed election campaigns in the previous four years (as a Conservative in Liverpool Everton in 1935 and as a Municipal Reform candidate in the 1937 London County Council election).  Etherton promptly joined the RAF and worked his way up to the rank of Flight Lietenant: the war also brought him love, as he married Charles de Gaulle's driver Johanne Cloherty in 1944.

The 1945 general election broke the mould in Stretford with the first Labour victory in the seat.  Herschel Austin, who pulled off a 19-point swing to ride the Attlee landslide to a 6,294-vote majority, was a furniture-maker by trade who had been headhunted into politics as a result of the war; he ended the Second World War as a staff officer in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, with the rank of Sub-Lieutenant.  In parliament he proved to be a strong left-winger, regularly clashing with Ernest Bevin over the matter of Israel (Austin was from a Jewish immigrant family, and his opinion was that Bevin was an anti-Semite).

In 1950 the intervention of the Liberals led to Herschel Austin losing his seat back to the Conservatives.  The new Tory MP for Stretford was Samuel Storey, who resumed a long parliamentary career interrupted by the Attlee landslide: Storey had been an MP for Sunderland from 1931 to 1945, and went on to serve as MP for Stretford from 1950 to 1966.  He saw off two future MPs during this time: Labour's Charles Mapp (Oldham West, 1959--70) lost here in 1951, while local doctor Michael Winstanley (Cheadle 1966--70, Hazel Grove Feb--Oct 1974) stood here for the Liberals in 1964 and polled 23\% of the vote.  It's fair to say that that was the last hurrah for Liberalism in Stretford.

Sir Samuel Storey lost his seat for the final time in 1966 to Labour's Ernest Davies.  Aged 39 at the time, Davies had made his career in physics: he lectured in the subject at Manchester and had done research in superconductivity for much of the previous decade.  In 1961 he had been elected as a Stretford borough councillor.

Ernest Davies quickly became a Parliamentary Private Secretary, but his seat was too marginal for a long government career to be feasible, and he lost his seat back to the Conservatives in 1970.  He later served on Southwark council in London from 1974 to 1982.

The new Conservative MP for Stretford was Winston Churchill.  The grandson of the former prime minister of that name, Churchill had very much followed in his grandfather's footsteps by becoming a war correspondent.  His coverage of the Six-Day War was particularly memorable, but Churchill also reported on Yemen, Borneo, Vietnam, the Prague Spring, the 1968 Democratic Convention, Biafra, China and the fall of Salazar in Portugal.  He had had a near-miss at getting elected to Parliament in the 1967 Manchester Gorton by-election, but Stretford was an easier proposition.  Helped by the withdrawal of the Liberals, Churchill put together a 7\% swing to win with a majority of 4,015.

Churchill was re-elected three more times as MP for Stretford, but his seat was never particularly safe: his majority fell to 1,237 in October 1974.  His career in government was undistinguished, although he did serve as a frontbench defence spokesman for a time opposing the Wilson and Callaghan administrations.

The 1983 redistribution broke up the Stretford constituency.  The Stretford name was retained by a new seat consisting of Stretford itself and two wards from the former Manchester Moss Side seat, namely Whalley Range and Moss Side; the Urmston half of the seat joined with the western half of Sale and some rural areas to the west of Altrincham to form another new seat called Davyhulme.  Projections were that the new Stretford seat would be notionally Labour whereas Davyhulme would be safe Conservative, and Winston Churchill successfully sought re-election in Davyhulme.

The new Stretford seat was won by Labour's Tony Lloyd, who was Stretford born and bred and had started his political career on Trafford council in 1979.  By 1983 he was deputy leader of the Labour group on the council, and Stretford proved to be a safe Parliamentary seat for him.  During his time as MP for Stretford Lloyd became a Labour whip in 1986, and he was an opposition spokesman on a number of topics from 1987 to 1997.

The redistribution of 1997 reversed the change made in 1983 and recreated the Stretford seat of 1950--83, although with the new name ``Stretford and Urmston'' and with boundaries which now included Partington.  The new seat was projected to be notionally Labour, and Winston Churchill---with his Davyhulme seat having been abolished---elected to retire after 27 years in the Commons.  The outgoing Stretford MP Tony Lloyd sought and won the selection for Manchester Central, where the Moss Side and Whalley Range wards had been transferred to, leaving the new Stretford and Urmston seat open.

The Labour nomination for the new seat was won by Beverley Hughes, a former probation officer who had made her career in social science: at the time of her election she was a lecturer in social policy at Manchester University as well as being leader of Trafford council.  She had no problem being elected into what has proved to be a safe Labour seat, and ended up winning three terms as MP for Stretford and Urmston.  Notable candidates Hughes defeated include the future Education secretary Damian Hinds, who was the Conservative candidate here in 2005; and the model Katie Price who failed to save her deposit as an independent candidate in 2001.

In the Commons Hughes worked her way up the greasy pole to junior ministerial level, serving in the Home Office from 2002 to 2004 when she was forced to resign over a scandal involving visas for Eastern European workers, and then in the Department for Education and Skills from 2005 to 2009.  Hughes retired to the Lords in 2010, and since 2017 she has been the deputy mayor of Greater Manchester.

Hughes was replaced as Labour MP for Stretford and Urmston by Kate Green.  Green had left a banking career to go into politics, serving from 2004 to 2009 as chief executive of the Child Poverty Action Group; she was appointed OBE in 2005 for services to welfare work.  In ten years in Parliament Green has been on the Labour frontbenches more often than not, most recently being promoted to the Shadow Cabinet in June 2020 as a replacement for Rebecca Long-Bailey.  She has a safe seat from which to do all this: in December 2019 Green beat the Conservative candidate Mussadak Mirza by 60\% to 28\%, a majority of 16,417 votes.

Local elections in the constituency indicate that this Labour hegemony is likely to continue.  The party dominates the Stretford wards in elections to Trafford council, while in Urmston and Davyhulme the Conservative vote has gone into freefall at recent elections.  Labour took minority control of Trafford council in 2018, ending 14 years of Conservative majority rule, and Trafford became majority Labour in 2019.

So, Kate Green probably has this seat for as long as she wants it.  However, age may be against her: Green turned 60 in May 2020, so unless Labour come to power at the next election it may be too late for her to make Cabinet rank.  But, you never know what the future may hold.
