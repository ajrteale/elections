One by-election on Wednesday 20th July 2022:
</p><p>
<h2>Nethermayne</h2>
</p><p>
Basildon council, Essex; caused by the death of independent councillor Pauline Kettle.
</p><p>

</p><p>
By-elections don't have to be held on a Thursday.  Any working day will do, and sometimes it's more convenient for everyone involved for a poll to be held on a different day of the week than is traditional.  Basildon has a full council meeting scheduled for Thursday evening of this week, so this by-election has been scheduled for Wednesday to allow the winner of today's poll to make an immediate start to their new post tomorrow.
</p><p>
So it is that we make a Wednesday trip to Nethermayne.  Nethermayne is the main road running south from Basildon town centre towards the Five Bells junction on the A13 dual carriageway and the village of Fobbing beyond it.  The road gives its name to an electoral ward of southern Basildon  which takes in the Lee Chapel South and Kingswood areas, together with part of Vange which is cut off from the rest of the ward by the Basildon Golf Course.  The main employer here is the Basildon University Hospital, the main general hospital for the New Town.  Nethermayne ward's northern boundary is the London, Tilbury and Southend railway line, with Basildon railway station providing frequent connections to the City of London and to the newer city of Southend-on-Sea.
</p><p>
Much of this ward's housing stock is New Town development from the late 1960s, although the Kingswood area has seen some redevelopment in recent years, and the ward's census return tends towards the working-class end.  We can see the ward's New Town origins in that a quarter of the ward's housing is still socially rented.
</p><p>
Nethermayne ward has some very unusual voting patterns for that sort of demographic profile.  In the 2010s this was a Liberal Democrat hotspot, and the party still had enough strength here after the Coalition was formed to win a July 2010 by-election and hold a seat in 2012.  However, both of those votes were on low vote shares - 33.5% and 35.8% respectively, indicative of the fact that politics here was becoming fragmented.  You can't keep winning on freak vote splits like that forever.  Indeed Nethermayne ward voted Labour once, in 2011.
</p><p>
The 2011, 2012 and 2014 local elections here were contested by someone who is notable enough for Wikipedia.  Terry Marsh was a professional boxer, who rose to become IBF world champion at light welterweight in 1987; he retired from boxing later that year as an undefeated champion.  Marsh had an eventful post-boxing career: he was acquitted of attempting to murder the boxing promoter Frank Warren at a 1990 trial, and then went into politics as the Lib Dem candidate for Basildon in the 1997 general election.
</p><p>
In 2009 Marsh changed his name by deed poll to "None of the Above X" as a protest against the fact that UK ballot papers do not have a "none of the above" option, and he has contested a number of elections in Basildon since under that name.   It would appear that there isn't much appeal for this sort of thing in Basildon: None of the Above X finished last in Nethermayne ward in 2011, 2012 and 2014, failing to break 100 votes on each occasion.  Marsh wasn't a candidate here in the 2017 Essex county council election, but nonetheless hit the headlines after taking his ballot paper out of the polling station (which is an electoral offence), and then physically attacking the presiding officer who tried to stop him; Marsh was prosecuted for assault, and fined.
</p><p>
Instead it fell to somebody else to stamp their authority on Nethermayne's politics.  Kerry Smith started contesting this ward in the July 2010 by-election as a UK Independence Party candidate.  He was elected as the ward's Essex county councillor in 2013, won Nethermayne in 2014, and still holds both positions.  Smith had saved his deposit as the UKIP candidate for the local constituency of South Basildon and East Thurrock in 2010 and the party had readopted him for the 2015 general election, but he was forced to give that up in December 2014 after a recording of him making offensive remarks about the party's LGBT group and the people of Chigwell fell into the hands of the <em>Mail on Sunday</em>.
</p><p>
That was the end of Kerry Smith in UKIP, but his political career is still going strong nearly eight years later.  He is now an independent Basildon and Essex county councillor, has served as deputy leader of Basildon council, and saved his deposit as an independent candidate for South Basildon and East Thurrock in the December 2019 general election.  UKIP built on Smith's success to gain the other two seats in Nethermayne ward in 2015 and 2016, from Labour and the Lib Dems respectively.
</p><p>
Those UKIP wins were on extremely low vote shares, but the days of fragmented results in Nethermayne ward appear now to be over.  Kerry Smith was re-elected in 2018 as an independent candidate with a massive majority, and the 2019 and 2021 elections here also returned independent councillors easily (gaining their seats from UKIP).  In May this year Smith was re-elected for a third term with a 70-14 lead over Labour in Nethermayne ward.
</p><p>
This by-election is to replace independent councillor Pauline Kettle, who passed away at the end of May aged in her late 60s.  Kettle had gained her seat from UKIP in 2019, so the winner of this by-election will need to seek re-election in ten months' time.
</p><p>
One independent councillor has come forward to replace Kettle: Mo Larkin is a former Labour and Conservative member of Basildon council, who represented Lee Chapel North ward for Labour from 2002 to 2004 and Pitsea South East for the Tories from 2007 to 2015.  She was the first Mayor of Basildon, serving as the town's first citizen from 2010 (when Basildon received its borough charter) until stepping down from the council in 2015.  Labour have reselected their candidate here from May, Dylan Wright.  Also standing are Mark Cottrell for the Conservatives (who control Basildon council and represent the local constituency), the Lib Dems' Stephen Nice who will be hoping to disprove the theory that nice guys finish last, and Michael Kinnane for Reform UK.

This is not the end of the week's electoral action, and there will be more Previews on Thursday.  Stay tuned for those.
