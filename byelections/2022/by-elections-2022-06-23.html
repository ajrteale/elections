Seven polls on 23rd June 2022, and we start with the Parliamentary Specials:

<h2>Wakefield</h2>

House of Commons; caused by the resignation of Conservative MP Imran Ahmad Khan.

It's now time for the third and fourth parliamentary by-elections of 2022, and the ninth and tenth of the 2019 Parliament.  Both of today's parliamentary seats are defended by the Conservatives, and both are the result of indefensible behaviour by the outgoing MPs.

For our northern poll today we have come to the cathedral city of Wakefield.  This was dubbed the "Merrie City" in the Middle Ages, and anybody who has been to Westgate in the city on a Saturday night will see that this is still the case.  The Westgate Run is one of Yorkshire's most notorious pub crawls, with about 20 bars located along the street of that name.

Anybody who has been to Westgate on a Saturday night will also be aware that the city has historically been home to some of the most dangerous members of our society.  Wakefield prison, which has been operating on the same site since 1594, is a maximum-security unit housing some of the UK's most notorious criminals.  It has left its mark on the English language, with the slang term "nonce" and even the nursery rhyme <em>Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush</em> having beem claimed to have originated in Wakefield prison practices.  Also here was the West Riding Pauper Lunatic Asylum, catering for Yorkshiremen and women with troubled minds.

One inmate of the Asylum was a woman called Patience Kershaw, who died there in March 1869.  Nearly three decades earlier, Kershaw - than a 17-year-old girl doing back-breaking work down the coal-pit near Halifax - had given evidence to the Ashley Commission on labour conditions in the mines.  Ashley's report resulted in the Mines and Collieries Act 1842, which banned women and boys under 13 from working undergound.  Kershaw's testimony was harrowing enough that it was turned into a song in the 20th century: here is a moving recording of it from the Unthanks.

Wakefield has had its fair share of coalpits, but the city's economy had more to it than that.  The city lies just outside the Heavy Woollen District on the River Calder, and textiles were a mainstay of the local economy for decades.  It was also a major administrative centre.  The West Riding county council was based here from 1888 to 1974, as was West Yorkshire county council from 1974 until its abolition in 1986.  County Hall is now the headquarters of Wakefield council.

The Heavy Woollen District takes in two smaller towns within the Wakefield constituency, Ossett and Horbury.  Both of these had alternative industries: the coalfield extends here, while Horbury also had a large railway and wagon works which survived into the 21st century.  Horbury has also given us the hymn <em>Onward, Christian Soldiers</em>: its lyricist, Sabine Baring-Gould, was the curate at Horbury Bridge.

The current Wakefield constituency also takes in the Wakefield Rural ward, which is located to the south-west of the city.  The largest component of this is the village of Crigglestone, while the ward also takes in the National Coal Mining Museum for England at Overton and the open-air Yorkshire Sculpture Park near West Bretton, which was previously the grounds of Bretton Hall.  This isn't the only centre for modern art in the area: the Hepworth Wakefield, opened in 2011 at Wakefield Bridge, is named after the noted sculptor Dame Barbara Hepworth who was born and grew up in Wakefield.

One thing which the city lacks is a professional football team: most Wakefield natives who follow football instead support Dirty Leeds.  The main sport here is instead rugby league.  Wakefield Trinity have been members of the Super League since 1999, finishing in fifth place on three occasions.

The constituency has excellent communication links to the outside world.  The M1 motorway runs through the area from north to south, and Wakefield Westgate is the last stop for intercity trains approaching Leeds from the south.  The unstaffed and, by reputation, rather grim Wakefield Kirkgate station is mainly for local trains, although there are occasional expresses beyond Yorkshire.

Wakefield was one of the large industrial towns which were enfranchised by the Great Reform Act of 1832.  The 1885 redistribution extended the Wakefield parliamentary borough to take in the Belle Vue area, and drew a new Nermanton constituency which completely surrounded the town.  The Normanton seat included Horbury but not Ossett, which was part of the Morley constituency at this time; it also excluded the villages of Woolley and West Bretton, which formed part of the Barnsley constituency.

The Wakefield parliamentary borough had a rather troubled early history, as we can see from the disputed result of the 1859 general election here.  The Conservative MP John Charlesworth, a colliery owner, was unseated by the Liberal banker William Leatham by the narrow margin of 406 votes to 403.  As the Election Court had not yet been formed, Charlesworth's supporters petitioned Parliament to void the election; the Commons' election committee and a subsequent Commission subsequently reported that both candidates had engaged in corruption, and 142 of the 866 electors had been bribed by one of the campaigns.  Following this the Wakefield seat was vacant for three years before Parliament eventually agreed to issue a writ for a by-election.  This was the end of John Charlesworth's political career, although Leatham was subsequently elected here in 1865.

The first MP for the post-1885 Wakefield borough was Edward Green of the Conservatives, who had first been elected here in 1874; however, his election campaign on that occasion was also corrupt and he was unseated by the Election Court.  Green returned to the Commons shortly before the 1885 general election by winning a by-election in Wakefield, and he was re-elected on the new lines with a slightly increased majority of 325 over Wentworth Beaumont of the Liberals.  Sir Edward Green, who was created a baronet in 1886, was from a Yorkshire ironworking family.

Green stood down in 1892 and passed the Wakefield seat on to John Charlesworth's son Albany Charlesworth, who had a majority of 404 over the Liberals.  Charlesworth served one term before passing the seat safely on to the Conservatives' William Wentworth-Fitzwilliam, the heir to the Fitzwilliam earldom and known at this time by the courtesy title Viscount Milton.  The Fitzwilliams were one of the richest families in the land thanks to their ownership of a large number of Yorkshire collieries, and nobody opposed Milton's re-election in 1900.

In 1902 William Wentworth-Fitzwilliam succeeded to his grandfather's titles (his father having died in 1877), and entered the Lords as the 7th Earl Fitzwilliam.  The resulting 1902 Wakefield by-election was the first parliamentary campaign for Philip Snowden, who would later serve as the first Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer; Snowden, standing at this time as candidate of the Labour Representation Committee, lost by a 60-40 margin as the Conservatives held the seat.  The new MP was another wealthy man: Edward Brotherton had made his fortune as a chemicals entrepreneur based in Wakefield, and he was an alderman of the city.

Brotherton's seat quickly became marginal.  In the Liberal landslide year of 1906 he was saved by a split in the left-wing vote, holding his seat with a 217 majority over the Labour Representation Committee candidate Stanton Colt.  A rematch against Colt in January 1910 saw Brotherton increase his majority to 519; but in December 1910 Labour stood down in favour of the Liberals' Arthur Marshall.  Marshall defeated Brotherton by 2,837 votes to 2,651, a majority of 186.

As can be seen, the Wakefield constituency voted Conservative at all but one election in the period 1885-1910.  The Normanton seat which surrounded it was a complete contrast, never voting Conservative or coming close to doing so during this period.  Its first MP was Ben Pickard, who went down the pits at 12 and rose to become the first president of the Miners' Federation of Great Britain.  If Pickard had lived a generation or two later he would almost certainly have been a Labour Party figure; as it was he ended up as a Liberal thanks to an arrangement in which the Yorkshire Miners Association were allowed to nominate the Liberal candidate for Normanton.  Effectively he was a joint Lib-Lab candidate.

Ben Pickard died in February 1904 at the age of 61 prompting the first Normanton by-election, which took place on 1 March 1904.  The Yorkshire Miners Association/Liberal nomination went to coalminer and trade union official William Parrott amid some controversy, as Parrott had already been selected as the next Liberal candidate for Leeds East.  The Balfour Conservative government was by now unpopular and the Conservative candidate Marcus Dorman didn't stand much of a chance.  On a snowy polling day Parrott increased the Liberal majority to almost 4,000 votes, a 70-30 margin.

William Parrott did not have a long tenure in the Commons: he died in November 1905, also aged 61.  For the resulting second Normanton by-election, scheduled for 27 November 1905, the Yorkshire Miners Association/Liberal candidate was another trade unionist and coalminer, Frederick Hall.  He was the chairman of the Rawmarsh School Board.  This time the Conservatives didn't bother to put up a candidate, and Hall won the by-election unopposed.  He was again unopposed at the 1906 general election a couple of months later.

In 1909 the Miners Federation of Great Britain instructed its members to leave the Liberal party and take the Labour whip, which Hall duly did.  He remained as MP for Normanton until his death in 1933, facing only one contested election before the First World War: in January 1910 he defeated the Conservative candidate Ellis Ashmead-Bartlett by 72-28.  Ashmead-Bartlett would go on to distinguish himself as a war correspondent at Gallipoli.

The Morley constituency, which included Ossett at this time, was a safe Liberal seat throughout the period 1885-1918.  It had three MPs during this period: Charles Milnes Gaskell from 1885, Alfred Hutton from 1892, and Gerald France from January 1910.

The 1918 redistribution left the Wakefield parliamentary borough more or less intact but redrew the seats around it.  A new Rothwell constituency was created, which was nominally based on what we now call the Rhubarb Triangle but also took in Horbury and Wakefield Rural District.  Ossett remained part of the Morley seat, now redrawn as Batley and Morley.

The Rothwell constituency had just as large a mining influence as the previous Normanton seat, and it was one of only a few seats which voted Labour at every election in the inter-war period.  Every one of those elections was won by William Lunn, who had gone down the pit at 12 and worked for 20 years as checkweighman at Middleton Colliery in Leeds.  Lunn had junior minsterial positions in both the Macdonald Labour governments.  Even in the Labour disaster year of 1931 his majority was over 2,500.  Lunn died in May 1942 at the age of 69, and the by-election to replace him went to the Labour candidate Thomas Brooks, another coalminer and trade unionist, who was elected unopposed thanks to the wartime political truce.

This column covered the history of Batley and Morley in some detail last year when previewing the Batley and Spen by-election.  This was a marginal seat which changed hands frequently during the inter-war period, voting Liberal in 1918, Labour in 1922 and 1923, Liberal in 1924, Labour in 1929, Conservative in 1931, and Labour in 1935 and a March 1939 by-election.

Wakefield also developed into a marginal seat during this period.  The Liberal win for Arthur Marshall in December 1910 proved to be a one-off, and to date he was the last Liberal MP for the city proper.  Marshall sought re-election in 1918 but finished a poor third, and Edward Brotherton recovered the seat he had lost in 1910 with a majority of 3,246 over Labour.

Brotherton stood down at the 1922 election, at which the Liberals withdrew and the new Conseravtivec candidate, Geoffrey Ellis, was run close by Labour candidate Albert Bellamy: Ellis' majority was just 618 votes.  The following year Wakefield voted Labour for the first time, railwayman George Sherwood winning with a majority of 621.  A rematch between Sherwood and Ellis in 1924 resulted in Ellis getting his seat back by 894 votes; round three in 1929 went to the Labour candidate Sherwood, decisively.

Or not, as the case may be.  Sherwood lost his seat in the Labour disaster of 1931 to the Conservative candidate George Hillman, a surgeon who was leader of the Conservative group on Wakefield council.  Unfortunately, Hillman was 64 and in poor health: he died in March 1932, just 144 days after his election.

The resulting Wakefield by-election of 21 April 1932 brings into our story one of the major players in the Labour Party at the time.  Arthur Greenwood had served in Cabinet during the 1929-31 Labour government as Minister of Health, but he had lost his seat in Nelson and Colne at the 1931 election.  Wakefield was the first winnable by-election for Labour during the 1931 Parliament, and the local Labour party selected Greenwood as their candidate.  He defeated the defending Conservative candidate A E Greaves by 13,586 votes to 13,242, a majority of 344.  A rematch between Greenwood and Greaves in 1935 saw reenwood increase his majority to 3,404.

Following the 1935 election Arthur Greenwood became deputy leader of the Labour Party.  When Nazi Germany invaded Poland in September 1939, Attlee was in hospital for an operation and Greenwood had to give the opposition response to the Prime Minister's statements in the House.  His speech of 2nd September 1939 responding to Neville Chamberlain may have been short and flustered, but he spoke for England.  In the wartime coalition government Greenwood initially served as minister without portfolio and was a strong supporter of Churchill during the May 1940 crisis; after leaving government in 1942 he stayed on the frontbench as Leader of the Opposition.  Greenwood finished his ministerial career with minor roles in the Attlee cabinet from 1945 to 1947.

The redistribution of 1950 greatly expanded the Wakefield constituency, which took over Horbury and the Wakefield Rural area from the abolished Rothwell seat.  This created a constituency similar to that of today, except that Ossett was excluded.  The boundary changes strengthened the Labour position in Wakefield, particularly so when the 1955 redistribution transferred the mining town of Royston into the seat.

Arthur Greenwood died in June 1954 at the age of 74.  For the resulting Wakefield by-election of 21 October 1954 the Conservatives put up a rising star.  Maurice Macmillan, son of the defence minister and future Prime Minister Harold Macmillan, was fighting his third election campaign after contesting Seaham in 1945 and Lincoln in 1951.  Maurice' future Cabinet career came from the much more Conservative climes of Surrey (more on that story later); for the Wakefield by-election he was up against a major Labour figure.

Arthur Creech Jones had started his career in the civil service, but lost that role when he was imprisoned as a conscientious objector during the First World War.  As such he went into trade unionism after his release, and was one of the founding officers of the Transport and General Workers Union.  His political career peaked when he served in the Attlee Cabinet as Colonial secretary from 1946 until the 1950 general election, when he lost his seat in Shipley.  Again, Wakefield provided a secure base from which a senior Labour figure could resume a political career.  Jones defeated Macmillan in the 1954 by-election by 21,822 votes to 15,714.  The Conservatives put up another future Cabinet minister against Jones in 1959: a very young Michael Jopling lost by a 60-40 margin.

Arthur Creech Jones retired at the 1964 general election and passed the Wakefield seat on to another senior Labour figure.  Walter Harrison, an electrician who had joined the Labour movement via the Electrical Trades Union, spent much of his parliamentary career in the Whips office.  He was Deputy Chief Whip during the 1974-79 Labour government, and played a decisive role in the 1979 no-confidence vote which brought down the Callaghan administration.  Sir Alf Broughton, the Labour MP for Batley and Morley, was on his deathbed and unable to travel to London for the vote; Harrison had approached his Conservative opposite number Bernard Weatherill to discuss whether an opposition "pair" could be found for the absent Broughton.  Weatherill offered his own abstention; Harrison, knowing that this would have ended Weatherill's political career, decided not to accept the offer.

The 1950 redistribution transferred Ossett from the Batley and Morley seat to the Dewsbury seat, where it remained until 1983.  This was more marginal than Wakefield but still voted Labour at every election during this period; the smallest Labour majority was 3,669 votes in 1959.  There were just two Dewsbury MPs during this period.  The former coalminer William Paling represented the seat until 1959, when he retired after suffering an injury to his neck in a 1957 air crash.  He was replaced by David Ginsburg, an economist specialising in market research who ended up as one of the Labour MPs to join the SDP in 1981.

The 1974 reorganisation of England's local government left the Wakefield constituency straddling the boundary between the new counties of West Yorkshire and South Yorkshire, because Royston had been included within the Metropolitan Borough of Barnsley.  The 1983 redistribution accordingly moved Royston into the new seat of Barnsley Central, leaving the Wakefield seat with very similar boundaries to those of 1950-55.  The removal of Royston took a large chunk out of the Labour majority, and this came close to making all the difference.  Walter Harrison was re-elected for his seventh and final term of office by just 360 votes over the Conservative candidate, Norman Hazell.

Harrison retired at the 1987 election and managed to pass the Wakefield seat on to the new Labour candidate David Hinchliffe, who increased the Labour majority to 2,789 and went on to make the seat safe again.  Hinchliffe was a social worker and former amateur rugby league player, who founded the All-Party Parliamentary Rugby League Group in 1988.  He never served in government, with his political career peaking as chairman of the Commons Health select committee.

For some reason the Wakefield constituency and those around it have been a favourite target of Boundary Commission meddling over the last half-century, with the seat seeing major changes in 1983, 1997 and 2010.  The 1983 redistribution saw Ossett moved out of the Dewsbury seat into the Normanton seat, which in this incarnation was an oddly-shaped seat stretching along the northern boundary of the Wakefield district while also taking in Rothwell from the Leeds city council area.  Normanton was represented from 1983 by former mineworker Bill O'Brien, who retired in 2005 as one of the oldest MPs on the Labour benches.  O'Brien is still with us, now aged 93.  Meanwhile in 1997 Horbury was transferred out of the Wakefield seat in Normanton, with the Wakefield seat stretching west to Denby Dale and Kirkburton to compensate.

For the 2005 election both the Wakefield and Normanton seats were open.  The Normanton Labour selection went to Ed Balls, who is a TV star now but at the time was best known as an economic adviser to the Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown.  Wakefield Labour selected Mary Creagh, the leader of the Labour group on Islington council in London.  Both of them were elected easily.

The 2010 redistribution created the Wakefield seat we have today.  Denby Dale and Kirkburton were removed from the seat and replaced with Horbury and Ossett from the Normanton constituency, which disappeared.  The Normanton MP Ed Balls sought re-election in the new constituency of Morley and Outwood, which he won narrowly; while Mary Creagh fought the revised Wakefield seat and also won narrowly.  The Conservative candidate for Wakefield Alex Story, a former rower who was on two Boat Race-winning crews and competed at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, cut Creagh's majority to 1,613 votes.

In 2015 and 2017 Creagh was challenged by Conservative candidate Antony Calvert, who had come close to beating Ed Balls in 2010.  These contests resulted in Labour majorities of 2,613 and 2,176 respectively, the Wakefield seat swinging against the national trend on both occasions.  Calvert was readopted by the Wakefield Conservatives for a third go at the seat in December 2019...

...or not, as the case may be.  Shortly before the nominations deadline a row broke out over poorly-judged social media comments by Calvert, who was forced to step down as the Conservative candidate.  Left in a position where they had to choose somebody - anybody - at the last moment, the Conservatives in Wakefield - the city which allegedly gave us the word "nonce" - ended up with Imran Ahmad Khan.

Wakefield born and bred, Ahmad Khan responded to a jibe from Mary Creagh that he had been parachuted into the seat by literally parachuting into the seat, as part of a skydive over the city.  Before becoming an MP he had worked in counter-terrorism and conflict zones, including a spell as a UN political assistant in Somalia.  His brother Karim Ahmad Khan is a prominent lawyer who is currently chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court in The Hague, and who may well be kept busy in future by the fallout of the ongoing war in Ukraine.

In December 2019 Imran Ahmed Khan defeated Mary Creagh by 21,283 votes to 17,925, a margin of 47% to 40% and a majority of 3,358, becoming the first Conservative MP for Wakefield since George Hillman in 1931-32.  Hillman served for only 144 days before his death.  Ahmad Khan lasted for longer than that but hasn't finished his first term either.  In June 2021 he was charged with sexual assault on a 15-year-old boy, an offence which took place in 2008; a jury at Southwark Crown Court found him guilty after a trial on 11 April.  Ahmed Khan is now serving an 18-month prison sentence.  He resigned from the Commons at the end of April, before sentencing.

The downfall of Ahmad Khan forces a parliamentary by-election in a marginal Conservative seat.  This is a rare occasion: the only other marginal Conservative seat to come up in a by-election since the party came to power in 2010 was Corby, way back in November 2012.  The Tories have lost a number of seats in by-elections in the ten years since then, but those were from safe positions.

We can already see the electoral backlash against the Ahmad Khan affair by comparing the Wakefield local election results from 2021 and 2022.  Across the six wards which form this constituency, the 2021 local elections - a particularly good year for the Conservatives - saw the Tories poll 47% across the constituency to Labour's 42%, with the Conservatives gaining the normally safe-Labour ward of Wakefield East.  Twelve months later, Labour carried the Wakefield constituency in the Wakefield local elections by 51% against 34% for the Conservatives, a swing of 11% in twelve months; the party also gained Horbury and South Ossett ward from the Conservatives.  In local elections the three Wakefield city wards are normally safe for Labour, while Wakefield Rural (Crigglestone and the other villages) is safe Conservative, Horbury and South Ossett is marginal, and Ossett has voted for all three main parties and UKIP in this century but is probably best described as a Conservative-inclined marginal at the moment.  Wakefield South ward, the Tories' best ward in the city proper, is not part of this seat: it's in the Hemsworth constituency.

There are 47 polling stations for this by-election, and hopefully every voter in the constituency has easy access to one of them given that public transport in this area is falling apart.  Bus drivers for Arriva, who have an effective monopoly on buses here, are on an indefinite strike over pay at the time of writing; and polling day for this by-election falls on a day of national rail strikes.

The task of picking up the pieces for the Wakefield Conservatives falls to their defending canidate Nadeem Ahmed.  He has served since 2006 as a councillor for Wakefield South ward, and he was leader of the Conservative group on Wakefield council from 2014 to 2021.

The Labour Party will have high hopes of a gain here.  Amid some disquiet from the local party their selection has produced Simon Lightwood, who is the head of communications for Calderdale and Huddersfield NHS Foundation Trust.

The only other party to save their deposit here in December 2019 were the Brexit Party.  Their successors, Reform UK, have nominated Chris Walsh, who is a gym owner from Morley.  The Liberal Democrats have reselected Jamie Needle, who was their candidate here in 2019: he is a parish councillor in Menston, near Ilkley.  Standing for the regionalist Yorkshire Party is local resident David Herdson, a software developer for a major building society who is a former chairman of the Conservatives' Wakefield branch and was until recently a regular columnist for the website politicalbetting.com.

Ten other candidates have been nominated for this by-election.  First of those alphabetically is Akef Akbar, who was the Conservative candidate who gained the normally safe-Labour Wakefield East ward in 2021; Akbar has since fallen out with the Conservatives and is standing here as an independent.  Three candidates here also contested the Batley and Spen by-election last year, including Paul Bickerdike of the Christian Peoples Alliance.  Mick Dodgson is standing for the anti-lockdown group Freedom Alliance.  The Official Monster Raving Loony Party have nominated Sir Archibald Earl 'Eaton.  Our second Batley and Spen returnee is former Britain First/EDL figure Jayda Fransen, who is currently disqualified from being a local councillor (but not from being an MP) following a conviction in 2018 for religiously aggravated harassment, is standing as an independent.  Jordan Gaskell is the candidate of UKIP, which even your columnist now has to accept is no longer a major party.  Thérèse Hirst, who was the most successful of our three Batley and Spen returnees last year, stands for the English Democrats.  The Northern Independence Party have now got their party registration sorted out, after failing to do so in time for last year's Hartlepool by-election: they have selected Christopher Jones.  The Green candidate is Ashley Routh, a former parish councillor in Lincolnshire who stood for election to Sheffield city council last month.  Completing the ballot paper is the official Britain First candidate, Ashlea Simon.
