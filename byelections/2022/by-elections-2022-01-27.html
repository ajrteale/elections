"All the right votes, but not necessarily in the right order"

Three by-elections on 27th January 2022, all in the same district:
</p><p>
<h2>Wilmington</h2>
</p><p>
Kent county council; and
</p><p>
<h2>Maypole and Leyton Cross; and<br/>
Wilmington, Sutton-at-Hone and Hawley</h2>
</p><p>
Dartford council, Kent.  The first and second vacancies result from the death of Conservative councillor Ann Allen, who was the chairman of Kent county council.  The third vacancy results from the resignation of Conservative councillor Lucas Reynolds.
</p><p>
January is a traditionally slow month for by-elections.  At parliamentary level, there has been only been one January by-election in the last 35 years (Oldham East and Saddleworth in 2011), and the cycle turns more slowly for local by-elections at this time of year as well.  The winter weather is not conducive to campaigning, and we are also now firmly in the buildup to the 2022 local elections which are just over three months away.
</p><p>
All of today's three polls take place in a corner of Kent, just outside the Greater London boundary.  That boundary runs through Joyden's Wood, which is described by its owner (the Woodland Trust) as "a tranquil, ancient woodland right on London’s doorstep. With its remarkable flora, abundant wildlife, and an intriguing history stretching back to Roman times, it’s a wonderful place to escape the hectic pace of city life".  What the Woodland Trust don't tell you is that a fair chunk of the wood was turned into a housing estate in the 1960s.  Rather like areas of Bexley just over the boundary which this column discussed last month in the Parliamentary Special for Old Bexley and Sidcup, Joydens Wood ward has a lower-middle class demographic; in 2011 it was in the top 90 wards in England and Wales for "intermediate" occupations.
</p><p>
In writing this preview I have checked a number of sources and not found any consensus as to whether there is a possessive apostrophe in the name "Joyden(')s Wood".  The current Dartford council ward of that name has an apostrophe, but the 2003-19 ward of that name didn't.  The Woodland Trust, Ordnance Survey maps and the wood's Wikipedia entry have an apostrophe, while OpenStreetMap (from which the maps below are derived) and the name of the local primary school don't.  I have not pursued the matter further.
</p><p>

</p><p>
The Joydens Wood ward which existed at the last census was split up in 2019, with the Maypole and Leyton Cross area declaring independence as a ward of its own.  Maypole has seen some population growth this century with the construction of a new estate on the site previously occupied by Bexley Hospital, a Victorian psychiatric unit.  The area has easy access to the A2 arterial road, providing fast links (if the Dartford Tunnel traffic is behaving itself) to nearby parts of London and Kent.
</p><p>

</p><p>
The Maypole and Joyden(')s Wood estates form part of the Wilmington division of Kent county council (above).  Wilmington itself, the childhood home of Mick Jagger, is located midway beteen Dartford and the quasi-New Town of Swanley.  The Wilmington parish takes in the eastern half of the Joyden(')s Wood estate and some development on the southern edge of Dartford, and the Wilmington county division extends into southern Dartford proper to include the area around North Kent College.  This is the Princes ward of Dartford, which on its boundaries ten years ago was in the top 70 wards in England and Wales for people with "Level 1" qualifications: in other words, 1-5 GCSE passes or equivalent.  Unlike the rest of the area being discussed today, Princes ward has a large amount of council housing.
</p><p>

</p><p>
All of the Wilmington parish and county division is within the M25 motorway.  The ward of Wilmington, Sutton-at-Hone and Hawley contains areas either side of this ring road, with Wilmington and Hawley lying within and Sutton-at-Hone outside it.  Sutton-at-Hone, which can be found in the valley of the Darent (the river which gave its name to Dartford) used to be a rather more important place than it is now: in days of olden time there was a Lathe of Sutton-at-Hone, a division of Kent which covered a huge swathe of what is now Greater London and western Kent.  Sutton-at-Hone is served by the railway station at Farningham Road, on the Chatham and Dover main line.
</p><p>
We see some of this past importance with the presence in Sutton-at-Hone of a National Trust property.  The Sutton-at-Hone Preceptory, as its alternative title of St John's Jerusalem might suggest, is a thirteenth-century chapel built by and for the Knights Hospitallers.  The chapel is set in gardens surrounded by a moat, with the River Darent forming one side of the moat.  Unfortunately, it is rarely open to the public.
</p><p>
In more recent times the Darent valley has provided rich pickings for the family-owned local firm J Clubb Ltd, who describe themselves as the leading provider of aggregates and concrete to North Kent and London.  Clubb have been extracting gravel from the Darent valley floor for nearly a century, leaving a legacy of flooded gravel pits.  The company have also had strong representation in the area's politics over the years.  Jimmy Clubb junior, the son of the eponymous founder, was a Dartford Rural District councillor back in the day, and he was escort to Ann Allen during her first year as Mayor of Dartford in 1993-94.  His grandson, Lucas Reynolds, is the district councillor whose resignation has led to the other by-election today.
</p><p>
Ann Allen was a very long-serving councillor.  She was first elected to Wilmington parish council in 1983, to Dartford council in 1987 and to Kent county council in 1997.  Allen was twice chairman of Kent county council and twice Mayor of Dartford, and had served for some years on Dartford council's cabinet: when she passed away in October at the age of 76, she was the cabinet member for youth, health and wellbeing.  In 2014 she was appointed MBE for services to the community in Dartford and Wilmington.
</p><p>

</p><p>
At the time of her death Allen represented the Wilmington division of Kent county council, and the Maypole and Leyton Cross ward of Dartford council.  In the 2019 Dartford council elections (the only previous poll on the current ward boundaries), she polled 84% of the vote in Maypole and Leyton Cross against only Labour opposition.  Her last re-election to Kent county council, in May last year, was with a 72-20 lead over Labour.  The Labour vote in the Wilmington county division is concentrated in Princes ward, which split its representation on Dartford council between one Labour and one Conservative councillor in 2019.

</p><p>
The Wilmington, Sutton-at-Hone and Hawley ward is divided between two divisions of the county council, with Sutton-at-Hone and Hawley parish forming part of the Dartford Rural division which is even safer for the Conservatives.  In 2019 the ward's three seats were easily won by the Conservative slate, which polled 51% against 19% for an independent candidate and 17% for UKIP.  One of the Conservative councillors, Calvin McLean, stood down in March last year to take up a politically-restricted job with Westminster city council, where he now works as the council's director of public protection and licensing.  The resulting by-election in May 2021 resulted in a Conservative hold with a 74-22 lead over Labour.  Even with the bad publicity and poor poll ratings the current government in Westminster has been attracting recently, you'd think that these majorities should be bombproof.
</p><p>
Defending the Wilmington county council by-election for the Conservatives is Av Sandhu, a long-serving Dartford councillor who has previously sat on Kent county council: he gained the safe-Labour division of Dartford North East in 2009, but lost his seat in 2013.  This should be a safer berth.  The Labour candidate is Darren Povey, who is a Unite rep and road safety campaigner.  Also standing are Julian Hood for the Green Party and Amanda Capell for the Liberal Democrats.
</p><p>
Turning to the two Dartford council polls, the defending Conservative candidate for Maypole and Leyton Cross is Kyle Stealey.  In 2019 he unsuccessfully contested the fast-developing Ebbsfleet ward at the other end of the district.  Standing against Stealey are Leah Uwaibi for Labour, Julian Hood again for the Greens and Kyle Marsh for the Lib Dems.  It's not often you see two Kyles on the same ballot paper.
</p><p>
The second Wilmington, Sutton-at-Hone and Hawley by-election in eight months follows the resignation of Conservative councillor Lucas Reynolds, who had served on Dartford council since 2015.  As happened in the last by-election, there is a ballot paper of three candidates.  This time the Conservatives have gone for youth by selecting George Holt, a Longfield and New Barn parish councillor who is in his early 20s.  Labour have reselected Maria Perry who was a distant runner-up in last year's by-election.  Completing this ballot paper is Jane Hatzimasouras for the Liberal Democrats.
</p><p>
Don't wait up all night for these results, because the Dartford returning officer will start the counts for all three by-elections on Friday morning.

<h2>Correction Corner</h2>
</p><p>
There is one correction to note arising from last week's column, where I wrongly stated that the Yorkshire Party had previously stood enough candidates to qualify for a party political broadcast.  This is not in fact the case.  However, in the 2017 general election there were enough Yorkshire Party candidates for the BBC to invite the party to a TV debate broadcast in the Yorkshire region only.  I suspect that's what I was thinking of.  Hopefully that's clear.
