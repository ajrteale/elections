Nine by-elections on 3rd March 2022, and we start with the big one.  It's time for the second parliamentary by-election of 2022, and the eighth of this Parliament:

<h2>Birmingham Erdington</h2>

House of Commons; caused by the death of Labour MP Jack Dromey.

Travellers on the M6 towards Birmingham (on the occasions when it moves) will find themselves on a long viaduct which runs for 5.5 kilometres between junction 5 at Castle Bromwich and junction 6, the tangled and sharply-curved sliproads of the Gravelly Hill interchange.  Or, as it is popularly known, "Spaghetti Junction".  Underneath the motorway lie the River Tame, the Derby-Birmingham railway line and, in time, the Birmingham branch of High Speed 2.  To the north side of the motorway is an industrial landscape in the Tame valley: the Jaguar factory at Castle Bromwich, the bulk of the Fort Dunlop building (which was once the largest factory in the world, and now contains a hotel and offices), and a tangle of canals, warehouses and power lines.

This is the beating industrial heart of the Birmingham Erdington constituency, which is essentially the part of Birmingham north of the M6 motorway and south of Sutton Coldfield.  Erdington itself can be found on the main road and railway line between Sutton and Spaghetti, not far from the junction with the ancient thoroughfare of Chester Road, the modern A452.  This gave the local economy a coaching aspect, but Erdington was generally quite small until the coming of the railways and its annexation by Birmingham.

Since 1997 the Erdington constituency has included Kingstanding, which takes its name from an event here in October 1642: Charles I, staying nearby during the early stages of the Civil War, reviewed his troops here at what was then largely rural open land.  Kingstanding mostly stayed that way until the 1930s, when Birmingham Corporation filled the area with thousands of council houses.  This column has seen a number of claimants over the years to the title of "largest council estate in Europe", and Kingstanding is certainly one of those claimants.

Indeed, most of the housing in this constituency is interwar; the main exceptions to this are the Victorian core of Erdington itself, and the troubled postwar overspill estate of Castle Vale at the eastern end of the constituency.  There has been a lot of regeneration of Castle Vale in recent years, with most of the tower blocks now long gone.

Erdington is just one of ten constituencies within the boundaries of Birmingham city council, which is by far the UK's largest local government unit with a population of over a million.  At the time of the 2011 census Birmingham had forty electoral wards of around 25,000 souls each, of which this constituency contained four: Erdington, Kingstanding, Stockland Green (covering the Gravelly Hill area), and Tyburn (covering the eastern end of the seat including Castle Vale and the Tame valley).  Because of the size of these wards it's difficult for census records to be set, but Erdington ward made the top 30 wards in England and Wales for residents born in the Republic of Ireland (3.2%), while Kingstanding ward was in the top 90 wards for unemployment (9.5%).  This is one of Birmingham's whiter constituencies but there were significant black and Asian minority populations across the seat, particularly in Stockland Green ward, while Kingstanding and Tyburn wards still have large amounts of social housing.

The 2011 census wards were created in 2004 and (as we shall come to later) abolished in 2018.  During this period Stockland Green and Tyburn wards were consistently safe Labour with the exception of 2008, a bad year for the Birmingham Labour party: the Conservatives won Stockland Green on that occasion and Tyburn voted Lib Dem.  Erdington ward started off as a Labour-Conservative marginal but was safe Conservative by the end of the period.  Readers of Andrew's Previews with very long memories might remember my profile of the Kingstanding ward in February 2014, which marked a breakthrough for the Conservatives after years of effort by their young candidate Gary Sambrook - again, we will come back to him later.  Before then Kingstanding had been a consistent Labour-Tory marginal, with the exception of an infamous result in 2006 when the BNP were wrongly declared to have won a seat here following a major cockup by the count staff.  The Election Court had to get involved to overturn that one.

The development of Birmingham and the Black Country placed a very tangled set of traditional county boundaries underneath an urban sprawl.  When the UK's first comprehensive set of single-member constituencies was drawn up for the 1885 general election, the Kingstanding area was still part of Staffordshire while Erdington was a town within Warwickshire.  The Birmingham city boundary ended at the River Tame, and major Birmingham suburbs like Aston and Handsworth were still independent.  The 1885 constituency boundaries reflected this, placing Kingstanding within the Handsworth division of Staffordshire and Erdington within the Tamworth division of Warwickshire.

The latter seat has a name which requires some explanation. The town of Tamworth is now definitely within Staffordshire, but in the nineteenth century it was a bit more complicated than that: the Staffordshire-Warwickshire boundary ran through the middle of Tamworth in those days, and the east of the town (including its railway station) was part of Warwickshire.  The two-seat Tamworth borough constituency contained territory from both counties until its abolition in 1885, at which point the Boundary Commission recommended that it be divided between a Staffordshire constituency (Lichfield) and a Warwickshire constituency.  They proposed the name "Coleshill" for the Warwickshire seat, but Parliament had other ideas and an amendment was passed to preserve the name "Tamworth".

The resulting Tamworth constituency covered basically everything in the north-west of Warwickshire which was not part of the parliamentary boroughs of Birmingham or Aston.  Included within its boundaries were Sutton Coldfield, Coleshill and Solihull, together with a host of villages including Erdington.

The Tamworth constituency of 1885-1918 was consistently Conservative and often left uncontested.  For most of this period it was represented by Sir Philip Muntz, who had entered Parliament the previous year as an MP for the predecessor seat of North Warwickshire.  Muntz weathered a strong challenge in 1885 from Birmingham businessman and Liberal candidate William Beale, prevailing by 53% to 47%; but after that he was only challenged twice more at the ballot box, in 1892 and 1906.

Philip Muntz died in December 1908, aged 69.  The resulting Tamworth by-election was won without a contest by the Conservative candidate Francis Newdigate-Newdegate, a Warwickshire county council alderman and former Grenadier Guardsman who was the owner of Arbury Hall in Nuneaton.  Newdigate-Newdegate had been MP for Nuneaton until he lost his seat in the 1906 Liberal landslide.  He faced only one contested election as MP for Tamworth, in January 1910, and was re-unopposed in December 1910.

Sir Francis Newdigate-Newdegate left these shores, with a knighthood, in 1917 to become Governor of Tasmania.  The resulting second Tamworth by-election of February 1917 took place during the wartime electoral pact, although the Conservative candidate Henry Wilson-Fox might not have been opposed anyway given the safe nature of the seat.  Wilson-Fox was a former business associate of Cecil Rhodes, serving as manager of Rhodes' British South Africa Company, and his politics were very much in Rhodes' imperial expansionist vein.  His election to the Commons came shortly after he was one of the prime movers behind the founding of the Empire Resources Development Committee.

One empire which was developing at this time was that of the city of Birmingham, which had annexed Erdington in 1911.  The redistribution of 1918 reflected this with the creation for the first time of the Birmingham Erdington parliamentary seat.  This was a bit different to the seat of today, omitting Kingstanding and Castle Vale (which had not been incorporated into Birmingham at this point), but instead extending to the south to take in the Nechells and Washwood Heath areas from the former Birmingham East constituency.

With those areas came the Unionist MP for Birmingham East, who transferred to Erdington.  He was Arthur Steel-Maitland, a former President of the Oxford Union who had previously served as the first Conservative Party chairman; at the time of the 1918 election he was a junior minister in the coalition government responsible for overseas trade.

Steel-Maitland won his new seat in 1918 with a 66-27 lead over an independent Labour candidate, nobody opposed his re-election in 1922, and he was re-elected easily over Labour in 1923 and 1924.  He served in Cabinet under Baldwin for the whole of the 1924-29 parliament, as Minister of Labour.

It might seem surprising that an area so solidly industrial should vote so solidly Consdervative.  Well, "Unionist" might be a better description during this period.  Joseph Chamberlain had passed on by this point, but Birmingham politics in the 1920s was still strongly in the grip of his family's political machine.  The Chamberlains had been on the Unionist side of the split in the Liberal Party over Irish Home Rule, and Conservative candidates in Birmingham were officially "Unionist" candidates for most of the inter-war period.

Sir Arthur Steel-Maitland might have been Minister of Labour, but ironically, it was Labour that did for his frontbench career in the end.  He lost his seat in the 1929 general election to Charles Simmons, who became the first Labour MP for Birmingham Erdington by 20,665 votes to 20,532, a majority of just 133.  It was a bad-tempered election, with Steel-Maitland threatening to sue Simmons for libel after the election over claims in his election literature; Simmons was forced to back down and apologise.

Charles "Jim" Simmons had a long, if punctuated, political career: he had first stood in Erdington in 1924, and he was first elected to Birmingham city council in 1921.  He had lost a leg at Vimy on the Western Front during the Great War, and spent a fair chunk of the period after the war lobbying for ex-servicemen.

Simmons was one of the many, many Labour MPs who were soundly defeated in the 1931 general election after the collapse of the Labour administration and the formation of the National Government.  The beneficiary in Erdington was the Conservative candidate John Eales, a barrister and (at the time) Recorder of Coventry.  Eales won the 1931 election with a majority of almost 19,000 votes over Simmons, who tried to get his seat back in 1935 and succeeded only in cutting Eales' majority to just under 10,000 votes.

John Eales suddenly died in August 1936, suffering a heart attack while on holiday in Whitby.  The resuting first Birmingham Erdington by-election, held on 20th October 1936, returned John Cecil Wright for the Conservatives with a reduced majority of 6,234 over Charles Simmons.  Cecil Wright had recently been elected to Birmingham city council, and had become chairman of a local screw, nut and bolt manufacturers after an early career as an RAF officer.

It was around this time that the developments of Kingstanding were starting to get going, following its annexation by Birmingham in 1928.  Before then Kingstanding had been part of the Perry Barr urban district within Staffordshire, and accordingly it was placed within a Staffordshire constituency at the 1918 redistribution.  Specifically, the Lichfield seat.  The Lichfield constituency of 1918-50 was a very different beast to the safe Conservative seat of today.  As well as the eponymous city it took in Tamworth, Rugeley, a large chunk of the modern Walsall borough (including Bentley, which was detached from the rest of the seat by Walsall itself), Great Barr and Perry Barr.  By 1945 it was grossly oversized with over 100,000 electors.  On these boundaries the seat only voted Conservative once, in 1924; it went National Liberal in 1922, Labour in 1923 and 1929, and in 1931 and 1935 voted for National Labour: that's the Labour splinter group/traitors (delete to taste) who went over with Ramsay MacDonald to join the National Government.  The National Labour MP James Lovat-Fraser died in 1938, and the resulting Lichfield by-election was narrowly won by the Labour candidate Cecil Poole against National Labour opposition.

This population growth also affected Birmingham Erdington, which by 1945 was by far the largest constituenvy in Birmingham with over 83,000 on the roll.  The Attlee landslide marked the end of the Chamberlain machine's grip on the city; even Big Joe's old seat of Birmingham West fell to the former Erdington MP Charles Simmons.  Erdington itself returned the Labour candidate with a large majority.

That new Labour candidate was Julius Silverman, a Birmingham city councillor, barrister and former warehouseman who was from a Jewish family which had been driven out of Minsk (then and, arguably, now part of Russia) by the pogroms.  Silverman was fluent in many languages - his parents spoke Russian and Yiddish at home - and he was one of the strongest chess players ever elected to Parliament.  He competed in an international chess tournament at Birmingham in 1937, defeating the eventual winner (and one of the strongest players of the time) Erich Eliskases of Austria.

Julius Silverman went on to serve as a Birmingham MP for 38 years.  He never got off the backbenches in the Commons, but was a strong campaigner against slum housing and had a long association with India which went back to his city council days.  Jawaharlal Nehru was a friend.

After being reduced in size in 1950 (with Washwood Heath being transferred out of the seat), the Erdington constituency was split up in the 1955 redistribution.  Erdington itself, along with Tyburn and the future Castle Vale, was transferred to the Sutton Coldfield constituency in a move which must have led to strong sales of pitchforks among the citizens of Sutton.  Sutton Coldfield is now part of the Birmingham city council area but wishes it wasn't, and it is very much a right-wing and affluent political enclave within the West Midlands urban area.

This was also true in the period 1955-1974, during which Sutton Coldfield's MP was Geoffrey Lloyd.  A former president of the Cambridge Union, Lloyd had previously represented Birmingham Ladywood (1931-45) and Birmingham King's Norton (1950-55), transferring here when the King's Norton seat was abolished in 1955.  He had held a number of posts in the wartime coalition government, but finally reached Cabinet rank in 1957, serving for two years under Harold Macmillan as Minister of Education.  One of the Labour candidates he saw off was a very young Roy Hattersley, who contested Sutton Coldfield in 1959.

The rest of the Erdington constituency (Gravelly Hill and Stockland Green wards) had Aston ward added to it and took the name of Birmingham Aston.  It also kept Julius Silverman, although his seat wasn't entirely safe.  Anthony Beaumont-Dark, who would later serve for 13 years as an outspoken MP for Selly Oak, lost Aston in 1959 by 53-47 and in 1964 by 55-45.

The boundary change of 1955 was reversed in 1974, and Birmingham Erdington was recreated to take in the Birmingham wards of Erdington, Gravelly Hill and Stockland Green.  Julius Silverman stayed on as Labour candidate, winning his eleventh and final term of office in 1979 with a majority of just 680 votes over the Conservative candidate, John Alden.

Silverman retired at the 1983 general election, giving Labour a tricky defence.  The redistribution of that year had turned Erdington into a notional Conservative seat.  The Tories selected a young man called Daniel Moylan, a former president of the Oxford Union who had previously worked as a diplomat and in investment banking.  The Labour candidate was Robin Corbett, a journalist who had served from October 1974 to 1979 as MP for Hemel Hempstead.  Very much against the national trend, Corbett defeated Moylan by 14,930 votes to 14,699, a majority of 231.  Moylan, who now sits in the Lords, went on to have a long career in London's local governemnt: he served for many years on Kensington and Chelsea council, he was a deputy chairman of Transport for London, and he was an adviser to Boris Johnson during his mayoral terms.

Robin Corbett went on to serve for 18 years as MP for Birmingham Erdington, eventually retiring to the Lords from what had become a safe seat in 2001.  During his last two years in Parliament he was chair of the Home Affairs select committee.

Corbett was replaced in 2001 as MP for Erdington by another journalist, Siôn Simon, who held the seat with a majority of 9,962.  Simon served two terms in the Commons, making it to the lower rungs of government office under Gordon Brown, before leaving the green benches in 2010 to campaign for an elected mayoralty for Birmingham.  More on that story later.

Birmingham Erdington took on its present boundaries in 2010, taking in a small corner of the then Kingstanding ward from the Perry Barr constituency.  The four general elections since then have all featured the same three candidates from the three main parties: Ann Holtom, who was a Lib Dem councillor for Tyburn ward from 2008 to 2012; Robert Alden, a Conservative councillor for Erdington ward since 2006; and Labour's Jack Dromey.  Dromey, who was born in London to Irish parents, was a lifelong trade unionist: his activism went back to the 1970s when he was a supporter of the Grunwick strikers.  At the time of his election he was treasurer of the Labour Party.

While on the Grunwick picket line Dromey met the strikers' legal advisor Harriet Harman, and they married in 1982 - the year Harman became an MP by winning the Camberwell and Peckham by-election.  Harman is still in post today as the longest continuously-serving female MP of all time; of the current members of the Commons, only Barry Sheerman and the Father of the House Sir Peter Bottomley have longer continuous service.  She was deputy leader of the Labour party from 2007 to 2015, twice stepping up to serve as acting leader of the party and Leader of the Opposition.

With his long experience within the party, Jack Dromey was on the frontbench for almost all of his time in Parliament.  In December 2021 Sir Keir Starmer reshuffled him to become shadow minister for immigration, and he made his first parliamentary speech on the subject on 6th January 2022 in a debate on Afghan resettlement.  The following day, he suffered a fatal heart attack at his constituency flat in Birmingham.  He was 73 years old.

Dromey had seen some rather large changes in Birmingham's local government during his time in office.  I mentioned Siôn Simon's campaign for an elected mayor for the city: well, this failed at a referendum in 2012.  Simon later served for five years as an MEP for the West Midlands, and during this time he was selected as Labour candidate for the larger West Midlands mayoralty, covering Birmingham, Coventry, Solihull and the four Black Country boroughs.  However, Simon lost this one too: the Conservatives' Andy Street, a former head of the John Lewis Partnership, won the position in the runoff by 238,628 votes to 234,862, a narrow majority of 3,776.  Street was re-elected in 2021 for a second term with an increased majority.

In the meantime, things were not going well for Birmingham city council.  In 2014 the government commissioned Sir Bob Kerslake, the outgoing Cabinet Secretary, to "conduct an
independent review of the governance and organisational capabilities of
Birmingham City Council with a view to making a series of recommendations for
improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the City Council."  The Kerslake report was critical of the council's governance and size, which at the time stood at 120 councillors with the largest wards in the country.  It didn't recommend splitting the city up - despite its huge size Birmingham is a coherent unit and there's no obvious way to divide it - but the Kerslake report did recommend cutting the size of the council and moving to whole-council elections to reduce the size of the wards, although the elector:councillor ratio would inevitably increase.

This change was carried out for the 2018 municipal elections, at which Birmingham council was cut to 101 councillors from wards of one or two councillors each.  The Erdington constituency now contains six whole wards (Castle Vale, Erdington, Gravelly Hill, Perry Common, Pype Hayes and Stockland Green) and most of a seventh ward (Kingstanding).  Across those seven wards, with the caveat that this includes some votes which were cast outside the constituency, the 2018 Birmingham elections gave Labour 50% of the vote and the Conservatives 43%; however, the Labour vote was strongly concentrated in Stockland Green and Gravelly Hill, meaning that the Conservatives won the seat count 6-4.  There have no council elections in this constituency since; the next Birmingham elections are scheduled for this May.  As to whether the council's governance has changed, well, the jury is still out on that one given that last year the education secretary sent in a Commissioner to run Birmingham's special educational needs and disability services.

Two of the six Conservative councillors elected in the Erdington wards were Gary Sambrook and Robert Alden.  I shall come back to Alden in a moment.  Sambrook was subsequently elected to Parliament in 2019, gaining the Birmingham Northfield constituency from Labour; he continues to serve as a councillor for Kingstanding, though.  He's still only 32.

The most recent Erdington election, in December 2019, returned Labour's Jack Dromey for his fourth and final term with a 50-40 lead over the Conservatives' Robert Alden.  The turnout, at 53.3%, was the eighth-lowest of any UK constituency.  If the general swing to Labour since the December 2019 implied by the opinion polls is accurate, then the party should hold this by-election easily.

Defending for Labour is Paulette Hamilton, who is a Birmingham city councillor (for Holyhead ward, which is divided between the Ladywood and Perry Barr constituencies) and sits on the council's cabinet, with the health and social care portfolio.  She has worked as an NHS nurse for 25 years.

Robert Alden, the leader of the Conservative group on Birmingham council and councillor for Erdintgon ward, is back for his fifth consecutive attempt on this seat.  This impressive display of bloody-mindedness clearly runs in the family: his father John Alden has also been the Conservative candidate for Erdington, way back in 1979.

Three other parties stood here in 2019 but none saved their deposits.  The Brexit Party have now morphed into Reform UK, who have selected former postman Jack Brookes.  The Lib Dems have changed candidate to Lee Dargue, who stood in the Ladywood constituency in 2019; he works in health and safety within the rail industry.  The Green candidate Siobhan Harper-Nunes is a business consultant.

Seven other candidates have been nominated, and I shall take them in the reverse of the order they appear on the ballot paper.  At the bottom is Mark Beech of the Official Monster Raving Loony Party, who has changed his name for the election to "The Good Knight Sir NosDa".  He is the Loonies' shadow minister for information superhighway maintenance.  Independent candidate and local resident Thomas O'Rourke appears to be standing to gain publicity for his pub The Peaky Blinder.  Supporters of the Militant Tendency may welcome the presence on the ballot of the former Labour MP Dave Nellist who has the nomination of the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition, although we are some way away from his former powerbase in Coventry where he was a Socialist city councillor for many years after being thrown out of Labour.  The evangelical Christian Peoples Alliance have selected Mel Mbondiah.  As well as O'Rourke we have two more local independent candidates on the ballot: Michael Lutwyche is a campaigner for victims of the 1974 Birmingham pub bombings and their families, while Clifton Holmes is an anti-gambling campaigner.  And, <a href="https://www.britainelects.com/2021/10/28/council-by-election-previews-28-oct-2021/">as this column exclusively hinted at last October</a>, the Comeback Special is on: we welcome back to the campaign trail veteran by-election candidate David "Militant Bus-Pass Elvis Party" Bishop, hoping that maybe this time the electorate will finally love him tender.

Birmingham council wards: Castle Vale, Erdington, Gravelly Hill, Kingstanding (most), Perry Common, Pype Hayes, Stockland Green

<h2>Redhill</h2>

Sunderland council, Tyne and Wear; caused by the resignation of Keith Jenkins, who was elected for the UK Independence Party.

The Erdington by-election is the main event today, but there are also eight vacancies on England's local councils being filled today.  We shall come later to the three Conservative and three Lib Dem defences and the free-for-all.  Before then we continue with a traditionally Labour-voting area for the time being, considering a by-election which may tell us an awful lot about how the May 2022 local elections - just two months away now - might go.

This column wrote in advance of the May 2019 local elections (<em>Andrew's Previews 2019</em>, page 106):

<blockquote>
Sunderland has to be mentioned here because it has a famously quick counting team.  The city has a Labour administration which is very locally unpopular while also having a very secure majority; that unpopulariity will translate itself into some wild anti-Labour swings which will get noticed and over-analysed because they will be the first results to come in.  Try not to read too much into these.
</blockquote>

And so it came to pass.  The Labour party lost 12 seats in 2019, and another nine in 2021.  They still have a majority on the council, but the Labour group is now down to 42 seats out of 75 - 17 of which are up for re-election in two months' time.  The latest council composition gives an opposition of 19 Conservatives, 12 Lib Dems and one independent, plus this vacancy.  While there might be a limited amount you can read into the last two years' Sunderland results on the national stage, Sunderland Labour are clearly in danger of losing control of the council in May for the first time since the 1970s reorganisation.

Which brings us to Redhill ward, which lies on the northern edge of Sunderland proper.  This is a ward of 1960s council estates running from Witherwack in the east through Hylton Red House to Downhill in the west.  Despite a few decades of Right to Buy socially-rented households still outnumber owner-occupiers here, and all the ward's census districts are within the 30% most deprived in England (with Witherwack and Downhill among the 10% most deprived).  In the 2011 census 45% of the workforce are in routine or semi-routine occupations with another 11% unemployed; the ward had the second-highest figure for Level 1 qualifications (1-4 GCSE passes or equivalent) of any ward in the North East, and Redhill was in the top 30 wards in England and Wales for population born in the UK at 98.7%.

Redhill has traditionally been a very strong Labour ward and a very weak Conservative area.  Indeed the Tories are usually so weak here that second place in the ward over the last 18 years has normally gone to a party which could be described as populist (for varying brands of populism): the previous runners-up here include the BNP in 2004-08, UKIP in 2012-15, the North East Party in 2016, the previous North East Party candidate as an independent in 2018, and the Conservatives in 2021.  The 2021 result here - 51% for Labour and 31% for the Conservatives - was by far the best Tory performance here in recent years.

51% was, however, a bit of a recovery for Labour after they had lost the ward in 2019 for the first time on the current boundaries.  The winner on that occasion was UKIP, which polled 41% of the vote against 38% for Labour and 14% for the Conservatives.  Redhill was one of three Sunderland wards which voted UKIP that year.  Those three UKIP councillors all quit the party last September, following dismal performances in the 2021 local elections: Steven Bewick (Ryhope ward) is now independent, Pam Mann (St Anne's ward) has joined the Conservatives, and following an independent interlude Keith Jenkins has resigned forcing this by-election.

There is still some form of UKIP organisation going in Sunderland and the party have found a candidate to defend this by-election.  He is Ian Lines, who contested St Peter's ward (covering the Roker and Monkwearmouth areas north of the city centre) in 2019 and 2021.  Labour, who will be looking for a gain here to bolster their position going into May's county elections, have selected John Usher who appears to be fighting his first election campaign.  The Conservative candidate is Sue Leishman.  Also standing are Steven Donkin for the Lib Dems (a party which, let me warn you, this column has a long and distinguished track record of underestimating in Sunderland council by-elections) and Helmut Izaks for the Green Party.

<h2>Election Court Watch</h2>

We stay in the North East for the latest in this column's occasional series covering legal challenges to election results.  Last month the Election Court disposed of the case of <em>Buchan v Elliott</em>, relating to the Hartlepool council election last year.  There was a close result in the ward of Fens and Greatham (that's pronounced GREE-tham, for those who aren't local), in which Hartlepool Independent Union councillor Bob Buchan lost his seat to Labour's Jennifer Elliott by just ten votes.  The Labour campaign material had wrongly claimed that Buchan, as a member of the council's planning committee, had voted in favour of a controversial planning application; in fact Buchan was not present at the relevant meeting due to illness, and Labour had failed to check the minutes of the meeting which would have shown this.  Buchan's case was that this amounted to a false statement of fact about his <em>personal</em> character or conduct; the verdict of the court was that the false statement made by Labour instead related to Buchan's <em>political</em> conduct, and the judge accordingly upheld Elliott's election.  Buchan will now have to pay Elliott's legal costs.  Even if he had won the case he would not have got back onto Hartlepool council quickly: the effect would have been to unseat Elliott, but as she is due for re-election in May anyway there would not have been time to hold a by-election before then.

<h2>Halton Holegate</h2>

East Lindsey council, Lincolnshire; caused by the death of independent councillor Jim Swanson.

For our free-for-all this week we are back in the fens of Lincolnshire, following the Aveland by-election in South Kesteven last week.  Our attention now turns to the Parts of Lindsey as we come to a ward containing seven parishes to the south and south-west of Spilsby.  The largest of these is Stickford, on the A16 road towards Boston, but this parish only has 402 electors on the roll.  Halton Holegate itself, to the east of Spilsby, has just seven fewer registered voters.  In the 2011 census this ward had a rather older population than the England average, with agriculture (not surprisingly given this fenland location) being a major part of the local economy; boundary changes for the 2015 election, which transferred Bolingbroke parish out of the ward, won't have significantly affected that.

Halton Holegate ward had been represented since 2011 by Jim Swanson, a former Mayor of Spilsby.  Swanson was at the time the county councillor for Spilsby Fen, having defeated Conservative councillor Julia Pears by 16 votes in the 2009 Lincolnshire county elections, and he took Pears' district council seat two years later.

In 2013 Swanson, standing on this occasion with the Conservative nomination, lost his county council seat to UKIP candidate Victoria Ayling.  Ayling subsequently had a few attempts at a higher-profile elected office: she was UKIP candidate for Great Grimsby in the 2015 general election, for Lincolnshire Police and Crime Commissioner in May 2016 and for the Sleaford and North Hykeham parliamentary by-election in December 2016.  All of those came to nothing, and Ayling lost her seat on Lincolnshire county council in 2017.

Jim Swanson subsequently went back to standing as an independent, and he was re-elected to East Lindsey council in 2015 and 2019.  On the latter occasion he enjoyed a 67-25 lead over the Conservatives.  He continued to work hard for the benefit of his constituents up to the end, attending a meeting of West Keal parish council in the ward just a day before suffering a stroke at the end of November, from which he did not recover.

With Swanson having polled 67% last time out, and with no new independent having come forward to replace him, there are a lot of votes up for grabs in this by-election.  Last year's Lincolnshire county elections suggest that the Conservatives may be best placed to gain this seat: the ward is split between two county council divisions, which both had large Conservative majorities last year.  A gain for the Conservatives would shore up their small majority on East Lindsey council, where they currently hold 30 out of 55 seats.

As stated, this is a free-for-all by-election.  It is a straight fight.  In the blue corner is Terry Taylor, the current Mayor of Spilsby; he is retired after a career in the communications industry, and according to his website he has been a county and district councillor in the past.  In the red corner is Keziah Wood, a Spilsby town councillor who was a Labour candidate for Lincolnshire county council last year.

<h2>Rayleigh North</h2>

Essex county council; and

<h2>Downhall and Rawreth</h2>

Rochford council, Essex; both caused by the death of Liberal Democrat councillor Craig Cannell.

After last week's relatively good Conservative results in Essex we are back for three more by-elections today in that county.  Two of these are just a few miles to the onrth of New Thundersley where we were last week, but we are not in Castle Point district this time.  Instead our scene today is in Rochford district, which covers a number of towns to the north of Southend.  Although Rochford is one of these towns, the district's main urban centre is in fact Rayleigh.

Rayleigh was a small town in mediaeval times with a Norman motte-and-bailey castle (of which little remains), but housebuilding in the later 20th century and since has caused its population to balloon.  Some recent development has spilled beyond the town boundaries into the parish of Rawreth, which separates Rayleigh from the town of Wickford to the west.

Rawreth parish is part of Downhall and Rawreth ward, which is the northern of Rayleigh's five Rochford council wards.  In the 2011 census this ward, which then had slightly different boundaries, made the top 70 wards in England and Wales for the ONS "intermediate" employment category.  Although qualification levels in the ward are relatively low, financial services and insurance appear to be major sectors of the local economy; Rayleigh has relatively fast trains to Liverpool Street and the City.

As this column pointed out in January 2018 (<em>Andrew's Previews 2018</em>, page 28), Downhall and Rawreth ward is Rochford's Liberal Democrat hotspot.  The by-election your columnist described there, caused by the death of Rochford's longest-serving councillor Chris Black (who was only 59) resulted in a 77-23 win for the Lib Dems in a straight fight with the Conservatives.  Craig Cannell was the winning candidate, and he was re-elected last year with a slightly-reduced majority of 62-29.

The presence of Downhall and Rawreth ward means that the Liberal Democrats have been consistently competitive this century in the Rayleigh North county division, which wraps around the north and east of the town centre to take in the whole of Rochford's Trinity ward and most of Lodge ward.  Neither of those wards have much of a recent Lib Dem track record.  At Rochford council level Lodge ward is normally a close contest between the Conservatives and the Rochford District Residents, and the Lib Dems have not contested that ward for some years; while Trinity ward is normally safe Conservative.

The whole area is represented at parliamentary level, as part of the Rayleigh and Wickford constituency, by the Conservatives' Mark Francois.  He has been the MP here since 2001.  Francois may be a character that those on the Remain side of the political divide love to hate, but from their point of view it could have been worse: in the run-up to the 2001 general election Francois defeated one Boris Johnson for the Conservative nomination here.

Given this and the generally good Conservative performance in the 2021 local elections, it must have been a bit of a surprise when the Conservatives nearly lost Trinity ward to a Lib Dem surge and did lose the Rayleigh North county seat to the Lib Dems' Craig Cannell.  The county result was very close; 45% for the Lib Dems and 44% for the Conservatives, a majority of 58 votes.

Unfortunately Cannell didn't get to savour these triumphs for very long.  He passed away in November, at the shockingly early age of 32, as a result of complications following surgery.  His legacy to the district will be the Rochford Bank Hub, which brought over-the-counter banking back to the town of Rochford in 2021 four years after its last high street bank closed.

To take the safe Rochford council by-election first, the defending Lib Dem candidate is Jim Cripps.  The Conservatives' Danielle Belton has appeared in this column before: she was the Conservative candidate in the last Rochford council by-election, gaining the neighbouring Sweyne Park and Grange ward from the Rochford District Residents in September 2019 (<em>Andrew's Previews 2019</em>, page 297), but the Residents took the seat back last year.  Labour's Lorraine Ridley completes the district ballot paper.

For the county by-election the Lib Dem defence is led by James Newport, who has represented Downhall and Rawreth ward on the district council since 2019 and also sits for Sweyne Park ward on Rayleigh town council.  The Conservatives have reselected Simon Smith, who was such a close runner-up here last year; he is also a district councillor, representing Lodge ward where he is up for re-election in May.  Also standing are former mayor of Rayleigh Jack Lawmon as an independent candidate, and Lorraine Ridley again for Labour.

<h2>Southchurch</h2>

Southend-on-Sea council, Essex; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Alex Bright.

For our third Essex by-election of the week we make the short journey from Rayleigh to Southend.  Southchurch itself ia a former village which was incorporated into Southend-on-Sea in 1911, and can be found a mile or two east of the town centre.  Here can be found the Southend High School for Girls, a grammar school whose former pupils include the <em>Countdown</em> co-host Rachel Riley.

The ward named after Southchurch lies in the north of the city's built-up area, and is rather socially-mixed.  In the north-west corner of the ward can be found a former council estate, and as of the 2011 census around 20% of the ward's households were socially rented.  However, the eastern part of the ward is the northern end of Thorpe Bay, one of Southend's most affluent suburbs.  Thorpe Bay railway station, the last stop on the c2c route before the terminus at Shoeburyness, lies on the ward's southern boundary.

Southend-on-Sea has somehow managed to escape the attentions of the Local Government Boundary Commission over the years, and it is the only English district whose current ward boundaries were introduced in 2001.  Over the last 21 years Southchurch has generally been a Conservative ward but the Tories have often come under pressure from independent candidates.  Some of this is spillover from Thorpe ward to the south, which is in the hands of an independent group who are politically right-wing but hate the way the Conservatives have run Southend over the years.  The Thorpe independents have previously supplied the council leadership, and they are currently part of the Labour-led rainbow coalition which runs Southend council.  Other independent challenges in the past have come from the council estates, and this part of the ward may be an explaation for the BNP coming a very distant second here in 2006 and 2007.

Overall independent candidates have won Southchurch three times on the current boundaries, in 2008, 2014 and 2019.  2021 was the first election in some years where there was no significant independent challenge in the ward, and the result was a big Conservative win: the party had a 63-16 margin over Labour, who finished second here for the first time since 2004.

The Conservative councillor re-elected here in 2021 was Alex Bright, who had been first elected in 2016.  Bright was a bit of a rising star in the party, and was reported to have applied for the Conservative nomination in the recent Southend West parliamentary by-election - more on that story later.  He didn't get that honour, but he has recently secured a new job: this is a diplomatic post which is politically restricted, and accordingly Bright handed in his resignation as a Southend councillor in January.

Defending for the Conservatives is Darryl Jones, who fought the safe-Labour Victoria ward of Southend in May.  Labour, who will be looking to build on their second-place finish last year, have selected community space manager and musician Nathaniel Doucette.  There will be an independent challenge this time from Susan Badger, who contested the neighbouring St Luke's ward last year.  Also standing are Jo Bates for the Green Party and Tristan Bembridge for the Liberal Democrats.

<h2>Brasted, Chevening and Sundridge</h2>

Sevenoaks council, Kent; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Anna Firth, who is now the MP for Southend West.

We now move south of the Thames from Essex to Kent, into a rural ward in the North Downs just off the south-east corner of Greater London.  Brasted and Sundridge are two villages lying to the west of Sevenoaks in the Darent valley, on the main road towards Westerham.  This is very much part of the London green belt, and housing here comes at a premium.  Perhaps because of this, Brasted, Chevening and Sundridge ward has a strong educated commuter demographic, with 42% of its workforce educated to degree level and 49% in managerial or professional occupations.  Finance and insurance are particularly well represented.

Brasted and Sundridge lie just outside the M25 motorway, which comes to a screeching halt within the ward at the curiously-designed junction 5, the Chevening interchange.  The reason for its unusual design is that the north-south road here came first as part of the Sevenoaks bypass; the M25 now forms the western and the northern arms of the junction, meaning that traffic which wants to stay on the M25 has to leave the main line and turn onto slip roads.

Most of the population of Chevening parish lives in Chipstead, which is essentially a part of Sevenoaks which has outgrown the town boundary.  However, the name of Chevening also brings to mind a 17th-century country house set in parkland just inside the M25.  For a quarter of a century Chevening was home to the Earls Stanhope.  Various Earls Stanhope have made significant contributions to art, science and politics over the years, and the family's modern-day legacy includes the National Portrait Gallery in central London and the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich.  The latter was founded by the 7th and last Earl Stanhope, who served in the Baldwin and Chamberlain Cabinets as First Commissioner of Works, President of the Board of Education and Leader of the House of Lords.

The 7th Earl had no children and his brother had died in the First World War, so he promoted the Chevening Estate Act 1959.  Under the terms of this Act the Chevening estate was left to the nation on his death as a country residence for a descendant of George VI or a Cabinet minister nominated by the Prime Minister.  Prince Charles considered living here before evenutally purchasing Highgrove in 1980; since then Chevening has normally been used by the Foreign Secretary, although other Cabinet ministers have been nominated from time to time.

One recent Cabinet minister who didn't have the run of Chevening as a resident was Sir Michael Fallon, who served in the Coalition, Cameron and May cabinets as Defence Secretary.  Sir Michael was the MP for the local Sevenoaks constituency from 1997 until his retirement in 2019, and he still lives in Sundridge.  Accordingly, he is an elector in this by-election.

Sevenoaks was a safe seat for Sir Michael Fallon, and this extends to lower levels of government too.  The Conservatives have a strong majority on Sevenoaks council, winning 46 seats out of a possible 54 in 2019; Brasted, Chevening and Sundridge ward returned the Tory slate with a 52-29 margin over independent candidates that year.

Since 2011 the Conservative councillors here had been Anna Firth, James London and Robert Piper.  Piper resigned from the council in March 2021, and the Conservatives held the resulting by-election in May 2021 with a reduced majority of 54-36 over the Liberal Democrats, who hadn't contested this ward in 2019.  The Tories had a bigger lead in the local Sevenoaks West county division on the same day.

Anna Firth's resignation means that the voters of Brasted, Chevening and Sundrdge are being called out for their second by-election in ten months.  I promised you more on the recent Southend West parliamentary by-election: Firth won the Conservative nomination for that poll, and she resigned from Sevenoaks council and moved to Southend in January before her election as MP for Southend West four weeks ago.

Defending this by-election for the Conservatives is Nigel Williams, the chairman of Chevening parish council.  The Lib Dems have selected Clare Coombe, who is a freelance classicist and writer from Sundridge.  Completing the ballot paper is Theo Michael for Labour.

<h2>Hythe West and Langdown</h2>

New Forest council, Hampshire; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Rebecca Clark.

There are a lot of Hythes around the south of England, as this was an Old English word depicting a landing-place on water.  The name is particularly common on the banks of the Thames, although centuries of language and pronounciation shifts mean that it can be difficult to spot that Rotherhithe, Stepney, Lambeth, Chelsea, Putney and Maidenhead all started off as hythes.  Away from the Thames, the Kent town of Hythe was one of the Cinque Ports and has given its name to a parliamentary seat (currently called Folkestone and Hythe) since mediaeval times.

The Hythe we are looking at today also lies on water, specifically the drowned valley of Southampton Water.  The village lies directly south of Southampton's cruise terminal, and there is a ferry across the water here connecting Hythe with the big city.

The census return for Hythe West and Langdown ward paints an interesting picture, with high levels of retirees combining with a working-age population which tends towards the working-class end.  The appeal for retirees is obvious, given Hythe's location at the edge of the New Forest.  Hythe has traditionally been a centre for marine engineering, often of a high-end nature - powerboats and hovercraft have been made here over the years - but the main local employer is now the massive oil refinery a few miles down the estuary at Fawley.  The resulting population growth has caused Hythe to merge with the inland village of Dibden Purlieu into a single urban area.

Despite the ward's rather working-class nature the Labour party are not organised here.  Instead, during this century Hythe West and Langdown has been a safe Liberal Democrat ward of the New Forest council, with the exception of the 2015 election when its two seats were split between the Conservatives and the Lib Dems.  The last New Forest council elections were in 2019, when the Lib Dems won a straight fight here 68-32.  The Liberal Democrats also hold the local county council seat, Dibden and Hythe.  However, the local parliamentary seat of New Forest East is safe for the Conservative MP Julian Lewis, although he briefly lost the Tory whip in 2020 after controversially being elected as chairman of the Commons intelligence and security committee.

This by-election arises from the resignation of Lib Dem councillor Rebecca Clark, who was first elected here in 2019 and had been the losing Liberal Democrat candidate in 2015.  She was also a candidate for Hampshire county council last year, contesting the safe Cosnervative division of South Waterside.

Defending for the Liberal Democrats is Sean Cullen, a Hythe and Dibden parish councillor who has previously worked as a secondary school teacher.  The Conservatives have reselected Terri Marwood, who was a rather distant runner-up here in 2019.  Also standing are Hythe and Dibden parish councillor Matthew Kitcher as an independent candidate, and James Gallagher for Labour.  The local press have interviewed all the candidates, and you can find out more here (<a href="https://www.advertiserandtimes.co.uk/news/meet-the-candidates-for-nfdc-hythe-west-langdown-byelectio-9241802/">link</a>).

<h2>Neroche</h2>

South Somerset council caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Linda Vijeh.

As often happens this column finishes the week in the West Country, with a ward of four rural parishes to the west of Ilminster.  None of them are called Neroche: the name refers to the former Forest of Neroche, an ancient hunting area to the south of Taunton.  Indeed Neroche parish itself (which also contains no village called Neroche), and the Blackdown and Neroche division of Somerset county council are, for the moment, over the boundary in the Somerset West and Taunton council area.  The largest centre of population in this ward is Horton, whose parish includes the major road junction on the A303 road at Horton Cross.

This area is part of the Yeovil parliamentary seat which, back in the days when the Liberal Democrats could win parliamentary seats in the West Country, was the fiefdom of the party leader Paddy Ashdown.  He has left the scene now and Yeovil now has a Tory MP, but the Liberal Democrats remain in control of South Somerset council.  They are helped in this by a very nice (from their point of view) vote distribution, as we can see from the 2015 council elections when the Conservatives won the popular vote across the district 44-36 but lost the seat count 28-29, with three independents holding the balance of power.  The 2019 South Somerset elections were a big win for the Lib Dems in both vote and seat terms.

However, the Somerset Lib Dems have yet to crack Neroche ward, which has been represented for some years at both district and county level by Linda Vijeh of the Conservatives.  In 2019 Vijeh was re-elected with a 61-26 lead over the Lib Dems for a fifth term on South Somerset council; she had also served since 2013 as the Somerset county councillor for the local Ilminster division.  Vijeh resigned both of those roles with effect from 1st January; there is a Somerset county council election coming up in May at which her vacant county seat will be filled, so this by-election is for her district council seat only.

Defending for the Conservatives is Kate Wylie-Carrick, who contested South Petherton ward at the 2019 South Somerset elections; she has recently retired from a teaching career which took her to New Zealand and Nepal before finishing in Somerset.  The Lib Dem candidate is Ray Buckler, who is a Horton parish councillor.  Also standing are Lynsey Arscott for the Green Party and Paul Sellers for Labour.
