One by-election on Wednesday 23rd February 2022:

<h2>Stanwell North</h2>

Spelthorne council, Surrey; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Jim McIlroy.

Yes, it's a Wednesday.  Yes, there's a by-election today. And why not?  By-elections in the UK tend to be held on Thursdays, but that's only a tradition: any working day will do, and sometimes it's more convenient for everyone involved to hold a by-election on a different day.  In this particular case, Spelthorne council has scheduled a full council meeting for 7pm on Thursday this week, with the budget for 2022-23 as the main item on the agenda.  Holding the Stanwell North by-election today will allow the winner of the by-election to make a start on their councillor career straight away, by attending that meeting and voting on the council's budget.

Full attendance may be important here, because the outcome of the budget meeting is not a foregone conclusion.  The 2019 elections to Spelthorne council returned a Conservative majority with 23 seats out of a possible 39; but this has since fallen apart.  There are 17 councillors left in the Conservative group plus this vacancy, but they are outnumbered by a rather fractured opposition.  The latest composition has 7 Liberal Democrat councillors (following a by-election loss to the Conservatives last year), two Conservative splinter groups totalling six seats, and two seats each for independent councillors, the Green Party, Labour and a Labour splinter group.  The council leader is a Lib Dem who rules in coalition with one of the independent groups: that coalition only controls 9 out of 39 seats on the council, so some deals may need to be cut in order for their programme to get through.

This might seem atypical for a council in true-blue Surrey, but then (a) recent local government results for the Surrey Conservatives have been generally awful, and (b) Spelthorne isn't really Surrey at all.  This is one of the few parts of Middlesex which escaped incorporation into Greater London in 1965, at which point it was added to Surrey in default of any better ideas.  The Spelthorne district is entirely north of the Thames, and is based on the outer London suburbs of Sunbury, Ashford and Staines, together with smaller places like the film and TV studio centre of Shepperton and the village of Stanwell.

Stanwell has suffered rather badly from development to serve the needs of the big city it lies on the edge of.  About half of Stanwell North ward's acreage is taken up by the Staines Reservoirs and the King George VI Reservoir, which provide drinking water for the city.  The ward's demographics also look more London than Surrey: there is a significant Asian population in the ward, with Sikhs forming the second-largest religious group here.  There are high numbers of households in shared ownership, and in the 2011 census Stanwell North ward was in the top 60 in England and Wales for those with "Level 1" qualifications (fewer than 5 GCSE passes or equivalent).

But there's one census statistic that really marks this place out.  A massive 27% of Stanwell North's workforce are employed in the transport and storage sector, which is the second-highest figure for any ward in England and Wales and the highest in south-east England.  Only Felixstowe West came higher than this figure; and indeed, of the top 12 wards for transport and storage according to the 2011 census, six were in Felixstowe or the immediately surrounding area.  The other six border Heathrow Airport.

Stanwell North lies immediately to the south of the Heathrow airport perimeter, behind the cargo terminal, and the ward includes a number of large warehouses for air freight.  Heathrow's passenger traffic fell off a cliff in 2020 for reasons which need no explanation, but cargo had taken up some of the slack so Stanwell North might have been affected slightly less badly than other Heathrow-area wards by the events of the last two years.  The residents of the village of Stanwell Moor, which lies immediately off the western end of Heathrow's south runway, may on the other hand have been grateful for a reduction in aircraft noise...

The last Spelthorne council elections were in May 2019 before all of this blew up.  This ward has been trending to the left over this century, and in 2019 Labour topped the poll here for the first time.  The Labour slate polled 45% of the vote and won two seats, the Conservatives polled 34% and won the other seat, and UKIP (the only other party to stand) finished on 20%.

The ward forms most of the Stanwell and Stanwell Moor division of Surrey county council, which from 2009 until 2021 was the only Labour seat in the council chamber (which has recently relocated from Kingston upon Thames to Reigate).  Since 2013 the county councillor here has been Robert Evans, who was a Labour member of the European Parliament for London from 1994 to 2009; Evans was also the Labour candidate who lost the Brent East parliamentary by-election in 2003.  However, at parliamentary level Spelthorne is a safe Conservative seat, which has been represented since 2010 by the business secretary and <em>University Challenge</em> champion Kwasi Kwarteng.

This by-election is for the final Conservative seat in Stanwell North, vacated by Jim McIlroy who had served since 2019.  In his short time in office McIlroy had briefly made it to deputy leader of the council, but he lost that position following the Lib Dem/independent takeover.

Defending for the Conservatives from a guaranteed place at the bottom of the alphabetical ballot paper is Michael Zenonos, who runs a logistics firm; he was the losing candidate in the last by-election to Spelthorne council, finishing second to the Greens in Staines ward last July.  Labour, who will have high hopes of gaining this seat, have reselected their unsuccessful candidate from 2019 Jon Button.  UKIP have not returned, so the ballot paper is completed by Paul Couchman for the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition.

<!--   WEDNESDAY PREVIEW ENDS HERE
        THURSDAY PREVIEW STARTS HERE -->

There are six by-elections on 24th February 2022, all but one of which are Conservative defences:

<h2>St Peter's</h2>

Castle Point council, Essex; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Bill Dick.

All of the six by-elections today take place on the drier east side of England, and after the weather of last week this may be a bit of a relief.  There is definitely no thunder in the forecast for Thundersley, a town which is now part of the urban sprawl which runs almost continuously across South Essex from Basildon to Southend. Here the A13 dual carriageway comes to a juddering halt on a roundabout before the road proceeds to Southend in a more leisurely fashion.

The livelihoods of the people living in Thundersley may well depend on more houses being built.  St Peter's ward, which lies north of the A13 and is the central of the three wards covering the town, was in the top 80 wards in England and Wales for those employed in the construction sector at the time of the 2011 census.  As with much of south Essex, owner-occupation rates are high here.

Thundersley is at the north end of the curiously-named Castle Point local government district, which takes in Benfleet, Hadleigh and Canvey Island.  Castle Point elections can get rather stuck in a rut.  The six wards covering Canvey Island are in the hands of a localist party, but they are outvoted by the eight wards on the mainland which are strongly Conservative.  As a result most years' elections in Castle Point finish with the Conservatives sweeping the mainland and the Canvey Island Independent Party sweeping the island, producing a council with a small but normally-stable Conservative majority.

Normally stable, but not always; and Castle Point has a recent political history which is as curious as its name.  It was a Labour parliamentary seat in the 1997 Blair landslide, but was one of the few Conservative gains in 2001 with previous MP Bob Spink returning to the Commons.  Spink subsequently ended up in UKIP, briefly becoming the party's first-ever MP (albeit by defection); he stood for re-election to the Commons as an independent candidate on a "save the green belt" ticket, and finished in a creditable second place.  A slate of Spinkite independent candidates stood in the simultaneous Castle Point council elections, polling well but finishing second in every mainland ward.

Spink subsequently resolved his differences with UKIP, which performed very well here in the 2013 and 2014 local elections.  In 2013 UKIP won the South Benfleet and Thundersley seats on Essex county council; the following year they carried five of the eight mainland wards and the Consevatives briefly lost their majority on the council.  There were slimmer pickings for UKIP in following years, and by the May 2016 election the party had reorted to dirty tricks.  Spink and his election agent tricked electors into signing UKIP candidates' nomination forms under false pretences, and they were subsequently prosecuted for electoral fraud: Spink was sentenced in January 2018 to six months in prison, suspended.  He had stood in May 2016 as the UKIP candidate for Essex police and crime commissioner, finishing in second place to the Conservatives; PCCs aren't meant to commission crime in that sense.

And then it was back to the status quo ante: until May 2021, when the Conservatives suddenly lost four mainland wards to an independent slate.  This leaves us with a crucial by-election in St Peter's ward.  The ruling Conservtives currently have 20 seats, and they are opposed by the Canvey Island Independent Party with 16 seats and four independent councillors for the mainland.  That 20-20 tie will be broken by this by-election.  If the Conservatives lose this seat, then control of the council will go with it.

St Peter's was not one of the wards which fell to the independent slate last year, but it was a close call: the Tory councillor Beverley Egan was re-elected with 45% against 40% for independent John Woodley.  Egan was also re-elected as the local county councillor for Thundersley, although with only a slightly larger majority.  This result is out of kilter for what is normally a safe Tory ward, which has voted for the party on every occasion since 2003 with the exception of a UKIP win in 2014.  The late Bill Dick was a veteran councillor who had represented St Peter's ward for over 38 years, and was he also the county councillor for Thundersley for many years until losing his seat there to UKIP in 2013.  He served as Mayor of Castle Point in 1992-93.  Dick's last re-election to Castle Point council came in 2019 with a 75-25 lead over Labour, so the winner of this by-election will serve until 2023.

Defending for the Conservatives is Michael Dixon, who manages a large family cleaning and gardening business.  The independent candidate from last year John Woodley is back for another go; he is a former police officer who currently provides advice for local schools about online child exploitation.  Also back for another go is the ward's regular Labour candidate Bill Emberson, who completes the ballot paper.

<h2>Wickham Bishops and Woodham</h2>

Maldon council, Essex; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Karl Jarvis.

We stay within Essex but move away from the urban sprawl along the Thames estuary.  The Wickham Bishops and Woodham ward is out in the countryside, covering seven parishes to the north and west of the town of Maldon.

More than half of the ward's electors live in Wickham Bishops, a village which lies roughly midway between Maldon and Witham.  The Bishops here is a reference to the Bishops of London, who owned the area in mediaeval times.  This was the childhood home of the recent England cricket captain Sir Alastair Cook, who learned the game as a boy while playing for Maldon Cricket Club and went on to become England's highest test run-scorer of all time.  The Woodham part of the ward name is a reference to the vilages of Woodham Mortimer and Woodham Walter, which lie across the River Chelmer to the west of Maldon.

As with the Stanwell North by-election in Surrey yesterday, we have here a case where the local MP is a Cabinet minister - the ward is part of the Witham constituency represented by the Home Secretary Priti Patel - but the Tories have fallen apart in local government over the last few years.  In 2011 and 2015 the Conservatives won 28 of the 31 seats on the tiny Maldon council, but then a strong surge from independent candidates left them with a much narrower lead of 17-14 following the 2019 election.  The Tory group has since split down the middle, they lost a by-election to the independents in May last year, and the independents are now in control of the district.

Wickham Bishops and Woodham ward has been less affected by this collapse than other areas.  In May 2019 the Tories had a 65-21 lead over the independent slate here, and the two county divisions it is split between were both safely Conservative in the 2021 Essex county elections.  This may be a good chance for the party to stop the rot.

Defending for the Conservatives is Simon Morgan, a former Army major who now practices as a solicitor specialising in agricultural and commercial property.  The ruling independent group on Maldon council have endorsed independent candidate Lance Peatling, who lives in Wickham Bishps.  Also standing are Colin Baldy for the Lib Dems and Matthew Wallis-Keyes for Labour.

<h2>Colsterworth Rural</h2>

Lincolnshire county council; and

<h2>Aveland; and<br/>
Isaac Newton</h2>

South Kesteven council, Lincolnshire.  The first and third vacancies are caused by the death of Conservative councillor Bob Adams.  The Aveland vacancy is caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Peter Moseley.

We now travel up the Great North Road to the Lincolnshire countryside south of Grantham.  This is an area with a lot of history.  Railway nuts will instantly recognise the location of Little Bytham on the East Coast Main Line, where the LNER locomotive <em>Mallard</em> set a 1938 world speed record for a steam locomotive which is yet to be beaten.

If <em>Mallard</em>'s designer Nigel Gresley and all the engineers who came before him saw far, it was by standing on the shoulders of giants.  One of the greatest of those was a man who was born without a father on Christmas Day 1642, in the small Lincolnshire village of Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth.  Unusually for those days, Isaac Newton got an education and obtained a degree from Trinity College, Cambridge shortly before the university closed down in response to the Great Plague of 1665-66.  Newton went back to Woolsthorpe, and there developed theories of calculus, optics and gravity which changed the world.  Legend has it that his theory of gravity was inspired by watching an apple fall from a tree; there are a number of claimed descendants of Newton's tree, including one which still stands in the grounds of Newton's old home at Woolsthorpe Manor.  This is in the hands of the National Trust, and can be visited.

Newton is best remembered today as a scientist, but he went on to have a career in public life.  Despite some rather unorthodox religious views and some dabbling in alchemy, he was twice an MP for Cambridge University and served for 30 years as Master of the Royal Mint, organising the Great Recoinage of 1696 and enthusiastically pursuing counterfeiters.

The modern-day district of South Kesteven, which covers Newton's birthplace, has commemorated Isaac Newton in the name of an electoral ward.  This ward runs south from Grantham along the A1 Great North Road to the border with Rutland.  Its largest population centre with 1,468 electors is Colsterworth, whose parish includes Woolsthorpe.  The only other village here with more than 1,000 electors is South Witham, which saw significant in this century for the use of servicemen and -women at nearby RAF bases.

Isaac Newton ward contains nine of the 24 parishes which make up the larger Colsterworth Rural division of Lincolnshire county council.  This takes in areas from four other wards to the east and north, including Little Bytham.

Both the ward and the county division were represented by Conservative councillor Bob Adams, who passed away in Novemnber at the age of 81.  Adams, who was retired from a career in accountancy and finance, had been elected to South Kesteven council in 2007, and was leader of the council from 2015 to 2017 and chairman in 2019-21.  He also had continuous service on Lincolnshire county council since 2013.

Some distance to the east of Colsterworth the hills flatten out and the landscape changes to fenland.  This is the Aveland ward, covering six parishes on the main road north of Bourne towards Sleaford.  None of these are called Aveland: the name refers to a former Wapentake of the Parts of Kesteven, which met at Aslackby within this ward.  The largest centre of population here is Rippingale, with 727 electors on the roll.

All three of these by-elections are Conservative defences and they are very safe wards.  The late Bob Adams was re-elected to Lincolnshire county council in May with a 77-23 lead over Labour in Colsterworth Rural; on the same day the Conservatives very easily held a by-election to South Kesteven council in Glen ward, part of which is in this division.  The 2019 South Kesteven elections gave the Conservative slate for Isaac Newton ward a 75-25 lead over Labour.

The Aveland by-election is a curious one.  Peter Moseley had served as the ward's councillor since winning a by-election in March 2014 with a 76-24 lead over Labour; he increased that to 77-23 at the 2015 South Kesteven elections, and nobody opposed his re-election in 2019.  In November 2021 he won an environmental award, the Green Flag award for "Councillor of the Year", in honour of his contribution to the district's parks and green spaces.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Councillor of the Year 2021 and the winner is…. Cllr Dr Peter Moseley, South Kesteven District Council <a href="https://twitter.com/southkesteven?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@southkesteven</a> Brilliant work 👏<a href="https://t.co/8VBs3xb4XG">https://t.co/8VBs3xb4XG</a></p>&mdash; GreenFlagAward (@GreenFlagAward) <a href="https://twitter.com/GreenFlagAward/status/1463166322041368586?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 23, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Less than two months later, Moseley was no longer a councillor due to poor behaviour on social media.  He is an opponent of COVID restrictions and vaccine mandates; given what has happened since the start of the year when the controversy around him blew up that might not have merited a resignation on its own, but comparing the Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau to Hitler did cross a line.  Moseley was suspended from the council's Conservative group, and resigned from the council shortly afterwards.

This gives the electors of Aveland their first contested district council election since 2015.  Defending for the Conservatives is Richard Dixon-Warren, an Army veteran of 40 years' service who is a parish councillor in Haconby, within the ward.  In a straight fight he is opposed by Labour candidate Barry Hare, who lives in Bourne and stood there in last year's Lincolnshire county elections.

For Colsterworth Rural the Tory defence falls to Charlotte Vernon, who has local government experience: she was a councillor over the border in Rutland from 2007 until losing her seat in 2015, and served as chair of Rutland council.  Her ward then was Ryhall and Casterton, which this column will profile (again) in two weeks' time.  Vernon now lives within this division in Castle Bytham.  The Labour candidate is Stuart Fawcett, a qualified horse whisperer who keeps Clydesdale horses at his farm in Great Ponton; he didn't do too well at the last South Kesteven by-election, in Grantham Arnoldfield ward last October, but this is his home turf.  Also standing for the county council are Harris Bisnauthsing for the Lib Dems and Mike Turner for the Green Party.

Finally we come to the Isaac Newton by-election, which is defended for the Conservatives by Ben Green who works for a leading environmental charity.  Stuart Fawcett is again the Labour candidate, and the ballot paper is completed by farmer Andrew Skelton as an independent candidate and Mike Turner again for the Greens.

This column likes to highlight pubs which do their bit for democracy by acting as polling stations, so shoutouts are due to the Welby Arms in Denton, the Fox and Hounds in Old Somerby, and the Hare and Hounds in Haconby.

<h2>Ferryhill</h2>

Durham council; caused by the death of independent councillor Brian Avery.

For our last by-election of the week we are in another area on the Great North Road and the East Coast Main Line, but this is 150 miles to the north of Colsterworth.

Welcome to Ferryhill.  Located about eight miles south of Durham on the main road towards Darlington, Ferryhill is a town of just under 9,000 souls which was made by the Durham coalfield.  It's of surprisingly recent vintage: the place was quite small until the sinking of a number of collieries in the early 1900s.

The town lies on an east-wet ridge of high ground which falls away to a north-south dip in the ground.  Through this runs the East Coast main line, which once had an extensive goods yard here.  Ferryhill's goods yard was extremely busy during the first half of the 20th century, partly because of congestion on the main line and partly because of its secluded location away from the main Luftwaffe bombing targets.

Modern Ferryhill is post-industrial.  The station and goods yard are long gone, as is the colliery and its spoil heap.  The present-day electoral division extends to the west along the ridge to take in the village of Kirk Merrington, and elects three members of Durham council.

Like many coalfield places, Ferryhill has long been a contest between Labour and independent candidates.  The late councillor Brian Avery, who passed away in October at the age of 81, was both: he was first elected in 1991 as a Labour member of the former Sedgefield council, and transferred to Durham council when the county's local government was reorganised in 2008.  Initially he had represented Chilton ward immediately to the south of Ferryhill in the Labour interest, but since 2013 he had been an independent councillor for Ferryhill division.  Away from politics he was an electrician by trade.

Avery was elected for Ferryhill in 2013 alongside two Labour candidates, Patrick McCourt and Pauline Crathorne.  McCourt resigned in 2015 and the resulting by-election, held on general election day, narrowly returned Labour councillor John Lindsay ahead of independent councillor Joseph Makepeace.

In 2017 Brian Avery topped the poll in Ferryhill with a large personal vote, Joseph Makepeace was elected in second place as a second independent candidate, and the third seat went to a new Labour candidate, Peter Atkinson.  Crathorne stood down and Lindsay was defeated.

The 2021 Durham county elections marked a historic change in the county's voting patterns, as Labour lost their majority on the county council which they had held continuously since 1925.  Overall Labour won 53 seats, 27 went to independent councillors (including five for the localist Derwentside Independents), the Conservatives won 24, the Lib Dems 17, the regionalist North East Party four and one for the Green Party.  Astonishingly, a rainbow coalition of the Conservatives, the Lib Dems, the Greens and most of the independent and North East Party councillors has been formed to run Durham, bringing an end to a century of Labour rule in the county.  The Liberal Democrats, whose electoral base is Durham city, provide the council leadership.

That score of 24 Conservative seats is comfortably their best performance in the unitary era.  As recently as 2013 there were only four Conservative councillors in the county, all of whom represented the town of Barnard Castle and the surrounding Teesdale rural area.  This performance follows up on the Tory gains of North West Durham, Bishop Auckland (the seat which includes Teesdale) and Sedgefield at the 2019 general election.  Ferryhill ward is divided between the latter two constituencies, with Ferryhill itself in the Sedgefield seat and Kirk Merrington included in Bishop Auckland.

So it came to pass that Ferryhill returned a Conservative councillor in May 2021, in a three-way split result.  Top of the poll with 37% of vote was independent candidate Brian Avery; Labour's Peter Atkinson was re-elected in second place with 35%; and Joe Quinn of the Conservatives won the final seat with 28% of the vote.  Quinn had a majority of 14 votes over the second Labour candidate Carole Atkinson; the outgoing independent councillor Joseph Makepeace finished nine votes further behind.

The death of Brian Avery means that this political balance may change at the resulting by-election.  There are two independent candidates seeking to succeed him.  Joseph Makepeace, who was an independent councillor for this ward from 2017 to 2021, is back for another go; and he is joined by newbie candidate Glenys Newby, who runs a non-profit organisation supporting local children and young people with career advice.  Labour have turned to the next generation by reselecting Curtis Bihari, who was an unsuccessful candidate for the county council here last year but was elected to Ferryhill town council; Bihari is a communications officer at the Ferryhill Sport and Education Centre, and also turns out for the local Mainsforth cricket club in times of better weather.  The Conservatives have recruited town councillor David Farry, who represented Ferryhill on the former Sedgefield council from 2007 to 2009 and on the current Durham council from 2008 to 2013; he has tried to get his seat back as an independent candidate in 2017 and 2021.  In 2017 Farry was runner-up in Ferryhill; in 2021 he finished in a rather distant last place, which may or may not be connected to an unsavoury incident during his 2018-19 term as Mayor of Ferryhill in which Farry turned up drunk to the Remembrance Sunday commemoration.  Three other candidates complete the ballot paper: they are Kaela Banthorpe for the anti-lockdown Freedom Alliance, Rebecca Dixon-McWaters for the Green Party and former Newcastle upon Tyne councillor Bill Thorkildsen for the Liberal Democrats.
