"All the right votes, but not necessarily in the right order"

</p><p>
So, the 2022 local elections have happened.  <a href="https://medium.com/britainelects/andrew-teales-2022-local-election-previews-e9fe434dc869">I wrote a piece before the election on the contests to watch</a>: now the results have come in some of my previews have survived in better shape than others.  Let's see what happened when the votes came out of the ballot boxes...
</p><p>
The Britain Elects team have prepared an interactive map of the results which you can enjoy at <a href="https://sotn.newstatesman.com/2022/05/2022-uk-election-results/">https://sotn.newstatesman.com/2022/05/2022-uk-election-results/</a>, and I would encourage you to refer to this map when reading the piece below.
</p><p>
<h2>North East</h2>
</p><p>
As usual, the returning officer for Sunderland delivered a swift and competent count.  2022 was the best Labour performance in the city for some years, with the party losing just one seat: Doxford ward, to the Liberal Democrats.  The Lib Dems also took Fulwell ward off the Conservatives.  Labour now hold 41 councillors out of a possible 75, with a postponed poll to come in Copt Hill ward.
</p><p>
Elsewhere in Tyne and Wear there was little to note, other than another good performance by the Green Party in South Tyneside.  This has been a particularly good election for the Greens who have entered a large number of councils across the country; they were already represented in South Tyneside and gained a further three wards, including coming through the middle of a close three-way result in Cleadon and East Boldon ward.  Those who follow local by-elections will recall that there was actually a very similar three-way result in a by-election there last September, except that on that occasion the Conservatives (who were defending the seat following a spectacular set of legal troubles for their previous councillor) were in first place.
</p><p>
Now, Hartlepool.  This is one of a number of thirds councils this year which were the dog that didn't bark: the curious incident was that not much happened.  2022 represented a golden opportunity for the Conservatives here: if they could repeat the 2021 results they would have an excellent shot at an overall majority on the council, while Hartlepool Labour - who were defending seven of their eleven seats - were in danger of being reduced to a rump.  In fact - contrary to anything you might have read - Labour were the clear winners of the 2022 Hartlepool election, finishing with seven seats and no nett change: the Tories did gain two seats to increase their lead as the largest party, but the losers were their coalition partners, the independent councillors.  If these results are repeated next year then Labour will become the largest party on Hartlepool council.
</p><p>
And the Hartlepool Conservatives have immediately found themselves a man down.  Their newly-elected councillor for Seaton ward pleaded guilty to assaulting his wife shortly before the election, and he has resigned before his term of office started.  Clearly a delightful trip to Seaton Carew is in order for the Previews this summer.  Round 3 of Jennifer Elliott v Bob Buchan, by the way, went to Buchan who narrowly gained the neighbouring Fens and Greatham ward for the Conservatives.
</p><p>
<h2 id="nw">North West</h2>
</p><p>
<img alt="The Cursing Stone" src="https://andrewteale.me.uk/misc/cursing-stone.jpg" />
</p><p>
Now, to Cumbria.  This column has referenced the Cursing Stone, a sculpture in a pedestrian subway in Carlisle, on a number of occasions: since its installation the city has been beset by flooding and other economic issues, and the death rate among councillors for Carlisle city centre in this century has been higher than that for Spinal Tap drummers.  However, the casualty rate among Conservative councillors in Cumberland this year is an order of magnitude higher than that: more like Saint-Marie or Midsomer, but with a cooler and wetter climate.
</p><p>
The Conservatives may well now be cursing their decision to go for local government reorganisation in Cumbria.  On paper the new Cumberland council must have been a good shot for a Conservative majority: the party held half of the Cumbria county council seats in the area, ran all three of the local district councils and held all of the three-and-a-bit parliamentary seats covering the new council.
</p><p>
But in the inaugural 2022 Cumberland council elections everything which could go wrong for the Conservatives went wrong.  The Labour party have a majority on the new council after making major gains in the Workington area where the independent challenge of recent years appears to have decisively seen off.  The party also gained a large number of seats in Whitehaven compared to 2017.  This is the core of the Copeland parliamentary seat, and the 2017 Cumbria county elections came immediately after - and to some extent repeated - the Conservative gain in the Copeland parliamentary by-election.
</p><p>
There are now no Conservative councillors in Carlisle city, and this column has no hesitation in awarding the coveted title of "this year's result which made my jaw drop" to the Liberal Democrat gain from the Conservatives in Carlisle's Stanwix Urban ward.  Stanwix Urban has been Conservative-held since the 1970s reorganisation and probably longer than that, and the Lib Dems had stood here only sporadically in recent years.  Another Lib Dem winner here was the outgoing Mayor of Bury Tim Pickstone, who becomes the Cumberland councillor for Longtown ward as well as winning the Longtown and the Border by-election to the outgoing Carlisle council.  The by-election in St Michael's ward, Allerdale was held by Labour.  Once the new Cumberland council comes into operation in April next year it will have 30 Labour councillors, 7 Conservatives, 4 Lib Dems, 3 independents and 2 Greens.
</p><p>
The other new Cumbrian council, Westmorland and Furness, will have a Liberal Democrat majority after the party swept every seat up for election in Tim Farron's Westmorland and Lonsdale constituency and performed well in the Eden sector of the new district.  There will be 36 Lib Dem councillors, 15 Labour (nearly all from Barrow-in-Furness), just 11 Conservatives, 2 independents and a Green.  Both new councils will be next up for election in 2027 before going onto the normal four-year cycle.
</p><p>
The local government reorganisation in Cumbria will leave just four Conservative-majority councils in the North West, all in Lancashire.  The only one of these up for election this year was Pendle, where the Conservatives recovered a majority which they had lost shortly before the election due to two seats going vacant.  There was very little change here, and the same applies to neighbouring Burrnley which remains hung.  The BBC website shows a UKIP loss here, but in fact the UKIP councillor was re-elected as a member of the Burrnley Conservative group which he has now been a prominent member of for some years.
</p><p>
There was a lot of change in Hyndburn, although mostly involving wards I hadn't identified in the preview.  Labour gained Rishton from the Conservatives, but lost three seats the other way: Clayton-le-Moors, Huncoat and the by-election seat in St Oswald's.  That leaves the council in no overall control with 17 Labour councillors, 14 Conservatives, 3 independents and 1 vacancy.  Labour need to hold the forthcoming by-election in Overton ward to get their majority back.
</p><p>
I had identified Rossendale as a possible Labour gain with a par score of 3 gains.  They didn't do quite as well as that, but still won an overall majority on the council with gains in Whitewell ward (a side valley going north towards Burrnley) and Irwell ward (eastern Bacup), which was won by six votes.  The new council has 19 Labour councillors, 11 Conservatives, 3 independents, 2 Community First (a Whitworth localist party), and a Green.
</p><p>
There was relatively little change in West Lancashire, which remains hung.  The Conservatives recovered North Meols which had been a surprising Labour gain in 2018, but Aughton Park ward swung the other way.  Labour also picked up a seats in Skem from a former councillor who had gone independent, while the Tories held a by-election in Wrightington ward.  The new council has 25 Labour councillors, 20 Conservatives, 7 Our West Lancashire councillors and 2 independents.  In South Ribble district, the Earnshaw Bridge by-election in Leyland was a Labour hold with an increased majority.
</p><p>
Merseyside's local politics aren't that interesting these days, especially with the Liverpool elections this year getting cancelled.  The results in the hung Wirral council were a copy of last year meaning that Labour lost three seats and fell further from a majority.  The new Wirral council has 26 Labour members, 24 Conservatives, 9 Greens, 6 Lib Dems and an independent.
</p><p>
Now, the Greatest Town.  This column's very own Little Lever and Darcy Lever was the first Bolton ward to declare and one of the first results in Greater Manchester - congratulations to the returning officer for an efficient piece of work there.  I was asked by a socialist friend on Facebook after the election "why did you vote the Tory candidate in some areas like Little Lever??".  Well, I stuck a great big hint right at the start of the preview as to how this could happen with this photograph:  See that there?  That's investment by the council you're looking at, something which (as the state of Bolton town centre attests) is rarer than hen's teeth.
</p><p>
<img alt="New Little Lever Library" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/little-lever-library.webp" />
</p><p>
Little Lever and Darcy Lever was gained by the Conservatives who run Bolton as a minority administration, increasing their tally on the council to 23 seats out of 60.  The localists here fell back at this election: Labour gained Farnworth from Farnworth and Kearsley First, while the voters of Kearsley - the ward with three competing localist candidates - were clearly OK with the One Kearsley candidate who won.  Little changed across the rest of the borough, although there were some close results - unusually close in the case of Crompton ward north of Bolton town centre, where the Muslim vote lined up behind the Conservatives who were the only party to field a Muslim candidate this year.
</p><p>
The new Bolton council has 23 Conservatives, 19 Labour, 5 Lib Dems, 3 Farnworth and Kearsley First, 2 independents, 2 Bolton Independent Group (ex-Conservative), 2 Horwich and Blackrod First, 2 One Kearsley, 1 Crompton Independent (ex-Labour), and 1 Little Lever and Darcy Lever First (ex-UKIP).  The Tory minority administration will probably continue for another year, but this is not a done deal: the administration has lost the support of the Lib Dems and Horwich/Blackrod First, reducing its room for manoeuvre.  Next year there will be an all-out election in Bolton on new ward boundaries.
</p><p>
New ward boundaries came in this year for Bury, and the all-out election resulted in an increased Labour majority.  The changes mostly came in the Bury South constituency where the MP is Conservative-to-Labour defector Christian Wakeford: Labour gained 3 seats from the Lib Dems in the Prestwich wards of St Mary's and Holyrood and one seat in the posh Whitefield ward of Pilkington Park, which offset 3 losses to the localist party Radcliffe First.  Radcliffe First also took two seats off the Conservatives in Radcliffe North and Ainsworth; the top two Conservative candidates tied there on 1,278 votes each and the winner of the Conservative seat was decided by a drawing of lots.  Finally in Bury North, Conservative-to-independent defector Yvonne Wright was re-elected at the top of the poll in Tottington ward, which is normally rock-solid Conservative.  The new council has 29 Labour councillors, 12 Conservatives, 8 Radcliffe First, 1 Lib Dem and 1 independent.
</p><p>
Oldham council will need a more detailed preview next year after the Labour leader of the council was defeated for the second year in a row, the Conservatives gaining Arooj Shah's ward of Chadderton South.  After Shah's car was firebombed last year, it shouldn't be too much of a surprise that complaints of a viciously personal campaign against her have been made.  The Conservatives also gained Royton North from Labour for the first time in years, but lost a by-election in the strongly-Asian Medlock Vale ward.  Labour also lost four more seats: both Failsworth wards to the Failsworth Independents, Saddleworth West and Lees to the Lib Dems and Coldhurst to an independent, and suddenly their control of the council is looking shaky.  The new Oldham council has 35 Labour councillors, 9 Conservatives, 9 Lib Dems and 7 independents (5 of whom are Failsworth Independents); there is an all-up election next year.
</p><p>
Other unexpected Labour losses in Greater Manchester include Hyde Godley ward in Tameside (to the Conservatives, who have no track record here), Ordsall and Quays wards in inner-city Salford (to the Lib Dems; Quays is a ward comprised almost entirely of brand-new urban living apartments) and Bryn ward in Wigan (to independent Steve Jones, whom this column has previously written about on a number of occasions).  In fairness to Wigan Labour, the party gained seats there overall.  The Greens now have group status in Manchester after gaining a second seat in Woodhouse Park ward, which covers southern Wythenshawe and the airport.  Trafford is turning into a very safe Labour council: the Tories held just three wards here this year, losing two seats to the Lib Dems, one to Labour (Ashton upon Mersey ward in Sale), and one to the Greens (Hale Central).
</p><p>
That was, however, a better Tory performance than in Stockport where the party was wiped out this year.  They lost Stepping Hill ward to Labour and both Bramhall wards to the Lib Dems, who are now clearly the largest party on Stockport council with 28 seats against 25 Labour, 5 Conservatives, 3 Heald Green Ratepayers and 2 Greens (who gained Reddish South from Labour).  Going into these elections the council had a Labour minority administration with Conservative support; that could well now change.
</p><p>
Halton council was strongly Labour as expected, but saw some drama in Daresbury, Moore and Sandymoor ward on the eastern edge of Runcorn: a close three-way result saw the Green Party lose a seat they were defending, the Conservatives and Labour tying for first place and the Tories winning the seat on the Returning Officer's drawing of lots.
</p><p>
<h2 id="yh">Yorkshire</h2>
</p><p>
The biggest prize in this year's local elections was the South Yorkshire mayoralty, which was held by new Labour candidate Oliver Coppard.  He had a rather weak result on first preferences, topping the poll with 43%; a close race for the other place in the runoff was won by the Conservatives on 17% ahead of the Yorkshire Party on 13% and the Greens on 12%.  Coppard then crushed the Conservative candidate Clive Watkinson in the runoff by 71-29.
</p><p>
Seats flew in all directions in Sheffield this year, but the net result is that Labour lost one seat to their Green Party coalition partners to finish on 39 councillors against 29 Lib Dems, 14 Greens, 1 Conservative and 1 independent.  That was a better performance than in 2019, and this column's par score for next year will involve Labour gains.  The other South Yorkshire council up this year was Barnsley, which remains strongly Labour even though the party lost three seats to the Lib Dems and Conservatives.  The Barnsley results contain a howler because the postal votes for Royston ward were accidentally left out of the count; luckily this error didn't affect who won the ward.
</p><p>
The Conservatives will not be happy with their performance in Wakefield ahead of the forthcoming parliamentary by-election.  They lost two seats to Labour in Wakefield district, Horbury and South Ossett (which is part of the Wakefield constituency), and Wrenthorpe and Outwood West (which is part of the Morley and Outwood constituency).  Labour lost Knottingley ward to the Lib Dems to finish up 1 nett across the metropolitan district.
</p><p>
Labour gains were also a theme in Kirklees.  My preview of Kirklees contained an error, in that Labour were actually defending Denby Dale ward following a by-election gain; they confirmed that by-election gain, reversed by-election losses to the Conservatives in Colne Valley and to the Lib Dems in Golcar, and surprisingly gained Holme Valley South (Holmfirth and surrounding areas) from the Conservatives.  This adds up to a Labour gain of Kirklees council; there are now 36 Labour councillors, 18 Conservatives, 8 Lib Dems, 4 independents and 3 Greens.
</p><p>
The other three West Yorkshire councils remain with Labour majorities, despite an excellent Green performance in Bradford where the party gained three seats.  In Leeds the 80s throwback of the Social Democratic Party have returned to elected office by gaining Middleton Park ward from Labour; however, gains elsewhere meant that Labour increased their majority on the city council.
</p><p>
The bright spot for the Liberal Democrats was Kingston upon Hull, where the party lived up to this column's par score and gained overall control of the council directly from Labour.  Labour gained the last Conservative seat in Bricknell ward, but lost Longhill and Bilton Grange, Sutton and University wards to the Lib Dems.  The new council has 29 Lib Dem councillors, 27 Labour and one ex-Labour independent.
</p><p>
North Yorkshire county council was held by the Conservatives as expected, but their majority was sharply cut: previously there were 55 out of 72 Conservatives county councillors, now there are 47 out of 90 giving a majority of just four.  The opposition consists of 14 independents, 12 Labour, 12 Lib Dems and 5 Greens.  The Tories also held the Wathvale by-election to the outgoing Harrogate council.
</p><p>
<h2 id="em">East Midlands</h2>
</p><p>
Not much changed in the East Midlands.  Labour do appear to have picked themselves up off the floor in Grimsby and they held the four seats they were defending on North East Lincolnshire council, but the Conservative majority here remains very secure.  Conversely the Conservatives continue to flourish in Amber Valley where Labour lost four seats: the new council has 30 Conservative councillors, 11 Labour, 3 Greens and an independent.  Derby, where the Conservatives were defending a more difficult ward map, swung the other way with three Conservative losses: the council remains hung with 18 Conservative councillors, 16 Labour, 8 Lib Dems, 6 Reform Derby and 3 independents.  There may well be some haggling to come over control of Derby council, which currently has a Conservative minority administration.
</p><p>
The two council by-elections in this region were rather a contrast.  The Conservatives held the Derbyshire Dales by-election in Carsington Water ward, but failed to make any headway in Rutland where the open seat in the Uppingham by-election convincingly went to the Lib Dems.  The Conservatives in Rutland continue to fall apart: the latest departure is Oliver Hemsley, the leader of the council, who quit the party shortly after polls closed for the by-election leaving behind some harsh words directed at central government.  He intends to stay on as council leader.
</p><p>
</p><p>
<h2 id="wm">West Midlands</h2>
</p><p>
Another local Tory boss with strong words for central government was Marc Bayliss, the leader of Worcester council.  In a result which this column didn't see coming given that Worcester has very few marginal wards in normal conditions, the Conservatives lost three seats here and overall control.  There are now 15 Tory councillors, 12 Labour, 6 Greens and 2 Lib Dems.  The other Worcestershire council up for election this year was Redditch, where I had warned that the Labour party here faced wipeout if the 2021 and 2019 results were repeated; in fact they held the four wards they were defending and gained three more from the Conservatives for good measure, a result completely out of kilter with what has gone before.  Those previous years' results mean that the Conservatives remain in control in Redditch, now with 20 councillors against 7 Labour and an independent.
</p><p>
The district councils up for election in Warwickshire and Staffordshire generally saw better Conservative results, with the standout being the Conservative hold of Newcastle-under-Lyme council.  The Tories had got their majority during the previous term by absorbing the independent councillors and gaining a Labour seat in a by-election, and the electors confirmed this: in possibly the best Conservative result of this cycle the new council has 25 Conservative councillors and 19 Labour, with the Lib Dems wiped out.  Labour could not stem further losses to the Conservatives in Cannock Chase or in Nuneaton and Bedworth, with the Conservatives gaining one seat in both districts.  The Conservatives also gained the Cheadle South East by-election in Staffordshire Moorlands district, although they were surprisingly run close by Labour.
</p><p>
The West Midlands boroughs saw little change overall, with Labour holding up well in Coventry against the backdrop of the bin lorry drivers' strike.  As I suggested the Labour majority in Birmingham was cut slightly as the party lost two seats: they have now 65 seats against 22 Conservatives, 12 Lib Dems and 2 Greens.  Labour have been wiped out of Solihull which saw a bit of a Lib Dem recovery compared with previous years; Solihull council now stands at 28 Conservatives, 14 Greens, 5 Lib Dems and 4 independents.
</p><p>
</p><p>
<h2 id="sw">South West</h2>
</p><p>
The big prize in the South West region this year was Somerset county council, which has been convincingly gained by the Liberal Democrats.  In 2017 Somerset had returned 35 Conservative councillors, 12 Lib Dems, 3 Labour, 3 independents and 2 Greens; the council size doubled this year, but only one of the 55 extra seats went Conservative.  The new council has 61 Lib Dems, 36 Conservatives, 5 Greens, 5 Labour and 3 independents, giving the Lib Dems a majority of 12.
</p><p>
The other councils up in this region saw deceptively little change.  The Lib Dems held firm in Cheltenham, holding 18 of the 21 wards for an unchanged majority.  Swindon council saw the Conservatives lose three seats to Labour, but excellent Conservative results in 2019 and 2021 meant that the council was not in play this year; the new council has 34 Conservatives and 23 Labour.  This will be one to watch next time.  Labour remain in control of Exeter with a large majority, although they lost two seats to the Green Party who are now tied with the Conservatives for second place on the council.
</p><p>
The deadlock in Plymouth has not been broken, after a shambolic Conservative campaign failed to live up to the expectations set last year.  Labour held the 11 seats they were defending, and the Tories lost a seat to the Greens to finish level with Labour on 24 seats each.  The Green councillor and the 8 independents (most of whom are ex-Conservative) will decide whether the Conservative minority administration continues.
</p><p>
The referendum in Bristol resulted in a 59-41 majority in favour of abolishing the city's elected mayor.  Labour Mayor Marvin Rees will be allowed to finish his term, which ends in 2024; after that the council will move to a committee-based system of governance.
</p><p>
There were no local elections this year in the Tiverton and Honiton parliamentary seat, which covers territory from Mid Devon and East Devon councils.  We may have to wait for polling evidence or campaign rumours to see whether any party is gaining, for what of a better word, traction.
</p><p>
<h2 id="ea">Eastern</h2>
</p><p>
Now turning to the east of England, this column did not see the Conservative loss of Huntingdonshire coming.  Until now Huntingdonshire had a Conservative majority continuously since 1976, although the district hasn't been exactly the same over that period: it lost a fair chunk of territory to Peterborough when that city gained unitary status in the 1990s.  The main Tory losses appear to have come in St Ives, which is not something that was particularly obvious from a number of by-elections there in the last council term.  There are now 22 Conservative councillors in Huntingdonshire against 15 independents (a figure which includes a St Neots localist party), 10 Lib Dems, 4 Labour and a Green.
</p><p>
Elsewhere in Cambridgeshire the Conservatives missed out on a good opportunity to gain Peterborough, where there were no net seat changes.  In South Cambridgeshire the Lib Dems increased their majority, and the Conservatives remain locked out of Cambridge city where Labour gained seats from the Lib Dems.
</p><p>
The Tories drew a blank this year in Norfolk.  They remain without representation in Norwich, where the Green Party gained one ward from the ruling Labour group; while the Lib Dems held the by-election to South Norfolk council in Mulbarton and Stoke Holy Cross ward.  In Ipswich Labour gained a seat from the Conservatives to increase their majority on the council.
</p><p>
Moving into Essex, it would appear that the Conservative and Highwoods Independents administration in Colchester has been defeated.  The Conservatives lost four seats this year, and the Highwoods Independents lost that ward to the Lib Dems.  The new council has 19 Conservatives, 14 Lib Dems, 13 Labour, 3 Greens and 2 Highwoods Independents; some sort of Lib Dem-Labour administration looks likely to take over this hung council.
</p><p>
The Conservatives also lost ground in Southend-on-Sea, where Labour won 8 of the 17 wards this year.  The council now stands at 21 Conservatives, 16 Labour, 8 independents and 6 Lib Dems.  In a result this column didn't see coming the neighbouring Rochford council is now in play for the 2023 election, as the Tories remain in control but lost six of the eleven seats they were defending.  There are now 21 Conservative councillors in Rochford, 10 Residents, 5 Lib Dems, 2 independents and a Green.
</p><p>
Elsewhere in the Thames estuary Castle Point council now has an independent majority after the Conservatives lost six of the nine seats they were defending and surrendered control of the council.  However, the Conservatives increased their majorities in Basildon and Thurrock; Thurrock Labour did better than last year's performance but still lost three of the nine seats they were defending.  The Conservatives also enjoy an increased majority in Harlow, successfully defended control in Epping Forest and Brentwood, and had no trouble holding the Little Baddow, Danbury and Sandon by-election to Chelmsford council.
</p><p>
In Hertfordshire, the eyecatching result is the one in St Albans where the whole council was up for election.  I wrote that "the Lib Dems can now probably count on winning all or nearly all of the 24 seats in St Albans proper, and with the council going down in size to 56 seats they won't need to win much outside the city to hold their majority".  Had you told me what was actually going to happen, I wouldn't have believed you.  The new St Albans council has 50 Lib Dem councillors against just four Conservatives, 1 Green and 1 independent (the latter two being elected without Lib Dem opposition).
</p><p>
The Liberal Democrats also retained the Watford mayoralty easily.  The incumbent mayor Peter Taylor won re-election in the first round with a 55-26 lead over Labour.
</p><p>
Welwyn Hatfield district saw a lot of change from last year, with the Conservatives falling from 15 wards to just four against seven Lib Dems and six Labour.  However, the comparison is with 2018 which means that there are only two Conservative losses at this election, and the Tories preserve their majority with 26 seats against 12 Lib Dems and 10 Labour.  The Conservatives also finished in third place across the wards up for election in North Hertfordshire, a district which they could have expected to gain based on last year's results: four Conservative losses means that they now have 19 councillors against 17 Labour and 13 Lib Dems, who run the district in coalition.
</p><p>
<h2 id="se">South East</h2>
</p><p>
I wrote that Milton Keynes was in a similar political position to North Hertfordshire, and it turned in a similar result.  The Tories' challenge for overall control fizzled out and they ended up losing two seats: the new council has 19 Labour and 14 Lib Dems against 23 Conservatives and one vacancy following the recent death of a Labour councillor.  Andrew's Previews will be back in the New City in due course for the by-election in Woughton and Fishermead ward.
</p><p>
The standout result in Oxfordshire is the Conservative loss of West Oxfordshire council, which was the constituency of David Cameron while he was Prime Minister.  The party lost five wards here, and held two others with majorities of five votes or fewer, as the Lib Dems made impressive gains to win half of the seats up for election.  West Oxfordshire now stands at 20 Conservatives, 15 Lib Dems, 9 Labour, 3 independents and 2 Greens.  Cherwell council now has a much smaller Conservative majority and will clearly be in play in the 2023 local elections.  Across the Thames, the Liberal Democrats gained the Steventon and the Hanneys by-election to Vale of White Horse council.
</p><p>
Turning to Berkshire, this column has been pointing out for some years that the Conservatives have been underperforming in Wokingham, but this year I poured cold water on the chances of the district falling into No Overall Control.  Wrongly, as it turned out.  In many ways this was a copy of what I wrote about West Oxfordshire above: the Conservatives lost five wards in Wokingham, with the Lib Dems winning half of the seats up for election.  There are now 26 Conservative councillors here against 23 Lib Dems, 3 Labour and 2 independents.  The all-out election in Reading produced a Labour hold with an increased majority (32 Labour, 7 Green, 6 Conservative, 3 Lib Dem); the Conservatives lost six seats here, but former BBC newsreader and journalist Clarence Mitchell did manage to secure re-election at the top of the poll in the new Emmer Green ward.
</p><p>
Hampshire saw two councils change hands.  Labour gained control of Southampton directly from the Conservatives just a year after the council went the other way; this involved an excellent performance from Labour who carried twelve of the city's sixteen wards, gaining four seats.  Southampton now has 26 Labour councillors, 21 Conservatives and one Lib Dem.
</p><p>
The Conservatives also lost control of Gosport council, whose all-up election returned 16 Lib Dems, 10 Conservatives and 2 Labour.  Gosport is often a place where the relationship between votes and seats is rather tenuous, and a quick look at the votes cast reveals that this Lib Dem majority was built on a lead over the Conservatives of 15 votes (37.4% to 37.3%).  On the far side of Portsmouth Harbour the Liberal Democrats are now the largest party on the hung Portsmouth council, after the Conservatives lost four seats.  Elsewhere in the county Basingstoke and Deane council will very much be in play next year after the Conservatives lost four seats; they now have 29 out of 54, with Labour in second place on 10.
</p><p>
Moving east to West Sussex, we see good Labour performances in all three of the councils up for election.  The highlight is Worthing.  Five years ago Labour had no councillors in Worthing and hadn't won a single seat in the borough since 1973.  Today, Worthing has a Labour majority and quite a large one: 23 seats against 12 Conservatives, an independent and a Lib Dem, after the party won 9 of the 13 wards up for election and gained six seats this year.  Contrary to what I wrote in the Preview, there was and still is no Green councillor here.  Worthing council shares a lots of its services with Adur council to the east, which will be in play for its next election in 2024 after the Conservatives lost two seats there to finish on 16 out of 29.
</p><p>
The result in Crawley has been widely reported as a Labour gain from No Overall Control, after Labour gained a seat from the Conservatives this year.  While this is correct as things stand - there are currently 18 Labour and 17 Conservative councillors - the situation in Crawley is, as always, complicated.  There is also one vacant seat and control of the council rests on a by-election next month in Southgate ward, which Labour are defending.  If Labour lose that by-election, the council will be tied at 18-18 and Labour would have to rely on the mayoral casting vote.
</p><p>
For East Sussex, I will defer discussion of the Brighton and Hove by-election to next week's edition of Andrew's Previews.  The main course here was the election for half of Hastings council, which was a rare low point for Labour who lost their majority on the council.  However, unlike 2021 it wasn't the Conservatives who made gains: Labour's three losses instead came at the hands of the Green Party.  There are now 15 Labour councillors, 12 Conservatives and two Greens.
</p><p>
The Surrey Conservatives do not appear to have found out how to pick themselves up off the floor after appalling results in 2019 and 2021.  This year's appalling result came in Woking, where the Conservatives lost all five seats they were defending.  I had speculated that the Liberal Democrats could become the largest party on Woking council; in fact they have an overall majority now, with 16 seats against just 8 Conservatives, 3 independents and 3 Labour.  The Conservatives have now fallen to third place on Tandridge council behind independents and Lib Dems, and if they can't sort their problems out control of Runnymede council could be up for grabs next year.
</p><p>
And the Tory wreckage continues as we finish in Kent, notwithstanding a Conservative hold in the Fawkham and West Kingsdown by-election to Sevenoaks council.  Maidstone council has fallen back into no overall control, a year after the Conservatives gained a majority.  But we've saved the most shocking performance in provincial England until last.
</p><p>
Seven years ago Tunbridge Wells returned 17 Conservatives out of a possible 17.  This year in a triumph of England's first-past-the-post system the Conservatives' first place, with 32% of the votes across the district and a 10-point lead over their nearest challenger, resulted in 2 Conservatives out of a possible 16, which represents a loss of 10 seats.  The Liberal Democrats are now the largest party on Tunbridge Wells council with 16 seats, against 13 Conservatives, 12 independents (a figure on the BBC site which includes the Tunbridge Wells Alliance) and 7 Labour councillors after the party won three wards this year.
</p><p>

</p><p>
Did you ever think you'd see the day when Labour won more wards in Tunbridge Wells than the Conservatives?
</p><p>
<h2 id="lo">London</h2>
</p><p>
Having toured England it's time now to wander around the capital, starting with what was the only hung council in Greater London.  Havering council is still the only hung council in Greater London.  At the time of writing the Residents have taken the lead on the council with 23 seats, against 20 Conservatives and 9 Labour; this is with one outstanding result for the three seats in Rainham and Wennington ward, where a recount has been requested but couldn't be arranged before Monday.  It remains to be seen whether the Conservative minority administration will continue or whether the Residents will try to take over the leadership.
</p><p>
The redwash in Newham has been broken, although not by the Conservatives; the new council will have 64 Labour councillors against two Greens, who were elected for the brand-new developments of Stratford Olympic Park ward.  The Newham mayoral result also showed a swing against Labour, although Rokhsana Fiaz was still re-elected for a second term with a large 56-12 lead over the Conservatives in the first round.
</p><p>
I regret to report that Tower Hamlets continues to be the Twenty-First Century Rotten Borough.  Monstrously corrupt electoral fraudster Lutfur Rahman is back as mayor, seven years after the Election Court disqualified him, after he defeated Labour's John Biggs by 47-33 on first preferences and 55-45 in the runoff.  Tower Hamlets council also again has a Lutfurite majority now, with 24 "Aspire" councillors, 19 Labour, 1 Conservative and 1 Green.  Every one of the 24 Aspire councillors is a Bangladeshi male, and this column recognises a few names who were mentioned - and not in a good way - in the Election Court's judgment from 2015 among their number.  Fasten your seatbelts, the next four years look set to be a bumpy ride.
</p><p>
No such shenanigans in Hackney, where Labour mayor Philip Glanville was re-elected in the first round with a 59-17 lead over the Greens.  Further up the Lea Valley Labour gained ground in Haringey and Waltham Forest but went backwards in Enfield, where this column had noted some poor by-election results over the last term: Enfield council now stands at 38 Labour and 25 Conservatives.
</p><p>
Enfield now has a smaller Labour majority than neighbouring Barnet, which had never returned a Labour majority before 2022.  Indeed, Labour had never even been the largest party there since London government's reorganisation in the 1960s, and the borough had swung to the Conservatives in 2018.  Barnet now has 41 Labour councillors against just 22 Conservatives.
</p><p>
As Barnet swung to the left, neighbouring Harrow swung to the right.  Harrow has been under Labour control since 2010 on small majorities, but the new boundaries and growing Conservative appeal to Hindu voters appear to have made the difference here.  The new Harrow council has 31 Conservative councillors against 24 Labour, the first Conservative majority here since 2006 and only the second since 1990.
</p><p>
Moving into inner London we now come to Labour's stretch target for this election, a test which would appear to have been passed.  Westminster city council had had a Conservative majority continuously since 1964 and Conservative dominance on the predecessor councils for decades before that.  The council has had a number of controversies over the years, but what finally did for the Conservative administration here appears to have been the gross waste of millions of pounds of taxpayers' money which was the Marble Arch Mound.  What a hill to die on.  For the first time, Westminster city council now has a Labour majority: 31 Labour councillors, 23 Conservatives.
</p><p>
And the bad news for inner London Conservatism continued with the loss of the borough where Normal Rules Do Not Apply.  The aggressive low-tax spell cast by the Wandsworth Conservatives has finally been broken, with council voting patterns at last coming into line with the large Labour leads seen here in recent Parliamentary, mayoral and GLA elections.  Wandsworth council now has 35 Labour councillors, 22 Conservatives and one independent.
</p><p>
I speculated that we might see wild seat changes in Merton.  And we did, although the council remains Labour controlled.  The Liberal Democrats had a go in the Wimbledon half of the borough and made major gains from the Conservatives to become the official opposition: the council now stands at 31 Labour, 17 Lib Dems, 7 Conservatives and two residents.
</p><p>
This was just one facet of a good Liberal Democrat performance in south-west London.  The party impressively held their majority on Sutton council, which now has 29 Lib Dems, 20 Conservatives, 3 independents and 3 Labour.  The Lib Dems also increased their majority in the two other London boroughs they hold, Kingston and Richmond.  Richmond upon Thames used to alternate between the Conservatives and Lib Dems at every election; now there is just one Conservative councillor left standing in the whole borough.
</p><p>
The only Conservative win in this year's mayoral elections came in the economic disaster area of Croydon council.  On first preferences the Tories' Jason Perry led with 35% of the vote, against 33% for Labour's Val Shawcross and 10% for the Lib Dems' Richard Howard; and Perry converted that into a very narrow win in the runoff by 38,612 votes to 38,023, 50.4% to 49.6%.
</p><p>
Perhaps appropriately for a council that can't organise its finances, Croydon win this year's Tower Hamlets Memorial Award for worst-organised election count, which eventually finished on Sunday evening.  Croydon's ward results tend to be very polarised and a number of previous elections have delivered Conservative wins in the popular vote together with a Labour majority on the council; this didn't quite happen this time, and the council is hung.  Labour are the largest party with 34 seats, against 32 Conservatives, 2 Greens, a Lib Dem and a vacancy.  Mayor Perry was also elected to the council, but because he had won the mayoralty his council seat has been vacated and a by-election will follow in South Croydon ward.
</p><p>
Our last mayoral election, and last English council discussed in this piece, is Lewisham.  In contrast to Croydon this was very much a "no change" result: the Labour mayor Damian Egan was re-elected in the first round with a 58-16 lead over the Greens, and Labour won all 54 seats on the council for the second election in a row.  Lewisham remains one of two London boroughs (the other being Barking and Dagenham) where Labour hold a local government monopoly.
</p><p>
</p><p>
<h2 id="wa">Wales</h2>
</p><p>
This was generally a good electoral cycle for the Labour party in Wales, certainly so in contrast with a poor performance in 2017.  The party gained an overall majority on two councils, including Bridgend.  The Conservatives hold the Bridgend parliamentary seat, but they lost 12 of the 13 seats they were defending on this council; the last one standing represents Newton ward in Porthcawl.  Overall Bridgend council stands at 27 Labour councillors, 21 independents, 2 Plaid and that Conservative.
</p><p>
The other Labour council gain was Blaenau Gwent, where an independent majority and Labour bloodbath in the 2017 election was reversed.  The new council has 21 Labour councillors against 12 independents.  Merthyr Tydfil council is now on a knife-edge, with the ruling independent group and Labour tied on 15 seats each.
</p><p>
I had speculated that there could be trouble ahead for Labour in Cardiff, but whatever problems the party had there have clearly been propelled away.  Cardiff now has an increased Labour majority with 55 seats, against 11 Conservatives, 10 Lib Dems, 2 Plaid Cymru and Neil McEvoy.  Hilariously, the Plaid Cymru seats - elected here on a joint ticket with the Greens - are in Pentyrch and St Fagans ward, most of which consists of a new housing development which Plaid and the Greens had opposed.
</p><p>
Against this good news for Labour is a major setback in Neath Port Talbot council where the party lost its majority.  I really should have mentioned this council in the preview, given that by-election results over the last term have been nothing to write home about for the Labour party.  There are now 25 Labour councillors, 18 independents, 12 Plaid, 2 Liberal Democrats, 1 Green and 2 vacant seats in Port Talbot ward, where the poll has been postponed after an independent candidate died.  The postponed poll will not affect the status of Neath Port Talbot as a hung council.  There is a clear geographical divide in the results, with the Labour councillors concentrated in Port Talbot, the  independents in Neath and the Plaid councillors in Pontardawe.  Goodness knows what administration will come out of this.
</p><p>
The Conservatives had a poor set of elections in Wales this year.  They went quite strongly backwards in the Vale of Glamorgan, where Labour are now the largest party with 25 seats.  13 Conservatives remain, there are 8 Plaid Cymru councillors, 4 independents and 4 localists for Llantwit Major.  A Labour-led administration looks likely to continue.
</p><p>
Worse than that was the Conservative performance in Monmouthshire, which was the only Welsh council with a Conservative majority.  It is now a hung council with Labour as the largest party: there are 22 Labour councillors, 18 Conservatives, 5 independents and a Green.  Labour missed out on 23 - which would have been half of the council - on a coin toss after tying with the Conservatives in Llanfoist and Govilon ward.
</p><p>
In rural Wales Plaid Cymru achieved their targets: the Welsh nationalists now have majority control of Anglesey, Carmarthenshire and Ceredigion to add to Gwynedd, which they already held.  Interestingly the Liberal Democrats are now the largest party on Powys council, which stands at 24 Lib Dems, 17 independents (who were the big losers here), 14 Conservatives, 9 Labour, 3 Plaid and a Green.  Commiserations to my former quizmate Myfanwy Alexander, who was one of a number of Powys cabinet members to lose their seats.  Pembrokeshire continues to have an independent majority.
</p><p>
Independents also remain the largest group on Conwy council with 22 seats, against 11 Labour, 10 Conservatives, 7 Plaid, 4 Lib Dems and a Green.  The Conservatives were the main losers at this election: they performed particularly poorly in Abergele where the party got caught up in a local controversy over access to land around Gwyrch Castle. For non-locals, that's the castle from <em>I'm a Celebrity...</em>.
</p><p>
This seems to have spilled across into neighbouring Denbighshire, where the Conservatives collapsed to just 6 seats and fourth place on the council.  Labour gained seats to become the largest party on 19, there are 12 independents, 8 Plaid councillors, 2 Greens and a Lib Dem.  The previous independent/Conservative coalition has lost its majority, so it's not clear what will happen next.
</p><p>
Interestingly the Labour gains in Denbighshire were not replicated in Flintshire, where the party lost ground to independents.  Labour are still the largest party on the council but now have 31 seats against 30 independents, 4 Lib Dems and 2 Conservatives.  Finally, there will need to be some coalition-building in Wrexham where Labour and Plaid made gains: Wrexham council now has 23 independent councillors, 14 Labour, 9 Conservatives, 9 Plaid and a Lib Dem.
</p><p>
<h2 id="sc">Scotland</h2>
</p><p>
Coalition-building and cross-party working are the order of the day in Scotland, where proportional representation is used for local elections and hung councils are the norm rather than the exception.  In 2017 every council on the Scottish mainland was hung, while this year two councils have an absolute majority: for Labour in West Dunbartonshire, and for the SNP in Dundee.
</p><p>
Because of the use of PR the councillor totals across Scotland give a good indication of vote shares.  The BBC has reported a total of 453 SNP councillors, which is a record for the PR era.  Labour are back into second place in Scottish local government on 282, the Conservatives fell to third on 214, there are 152 independent councillors, 87 Lib Dems, 35 Greens and three seats (two in the Western Isles, one in Shetland) where by-elections will be held after no candidates came forward.  Conservatives and independents lost ground, everybody else gained seats.
</p><p>
As stated, the SNP have an absolute majority in Dundee.  The nationalists narrowly remain the largest party in Glasgow, winning 37 seats against 36 Labour, 10 Greens and 2 Conservatives; that's an increase in the majority for the SNP-Green coalition running the city.  What happens in Edinburgh is less clear-cut: the capital now has 19 SNP councillors, 13 Labour, 12 Lib Dems, 10 Greens and 9 Conservatives, and there doesn't seem to be much appetite for the current SNP-Labour coalition to continue.  The Conservative-Labour minority coalition in Aberdeen has lost ground: the Granite City now has 20 SNP councillors, 11 Labour, 8 Conservatives, 4 Lib Dems and 2 independents.
</p><p>
Andrew's Previews would like to send its commiserations to this column's former host Kristofer Keane, who failed in a bid to be elected to South Lanarkshire council as an independent candidate.
</p><p>
<h2 id="ni">Northern Ireland</h2>
</p><p>
The last and most consequential of this year's May elections is the general election for the Northern Ireland Assembly.  For the first time, we will have a Nationalist First Minister after Sinn Féin emerged as the largest party, holding all of their 27 seats.  The Unionist and Nationalist blocs have both lost ground in the new Assembly: on the Unionist side there are now 25 DUP members, 9 Ulster Unionists, 2 independents and 1 from Traditional Unionist Voice (who did a lot better on first preferences than that implies, but failed to pick up the necessary transfers) for a total of 37, while on the Nationalist side 27 Shinners add to 8 SDLP members for a total of 35.  The "Other" cross-community bloc increases to a record of 18 MLAs, 17 for the Alliance Party (who gained nine seats at this election, mostly from the SDLP and the DUP) and one for People Before Profit.  The new Assembly has a clear majority of parties in favour of the Northern Ireland Protocol to the Brexit agreement.
</p><p>
So what happens next?  Well, contrary to what I wrote in the Preview the DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, who was elected at the top of the poll in the Lagan Valley constituency, now has an immediate choice to make as to whether to keep his Assembly seat (which would trigger a parliamentary by-election in Lagan Valley) or stay in Westminster and co-opt somebody else onto the Assembly.  There is also a choice to make as to whether the DUP want to participate in a new Northern Ireland Government while holding the Deputy First Minister position.  We shall see.
</p><p>
Thanks are due to our Returning Officers and their staff for successfully delivering another election without fuss and almost entirely without incident.  In an election with so many moving parts this a serious achievement.  Well done to all involved.  On behalf of the Britain Elects team, I would like to send congratulations to all the winning candidates, commiserations to the losers and thanks to everybody who cast a vote last Thursday - whoever you cast it for.
</p><p>
I hope you have enjoyed the Britain Elects coverage of the May elections.  Our spreadsheet of the results will be available soon, watch the Twitter feed for announcements.  Normal Previews service will resume later this week with two local by-elections in England.
