"All the right votes, but not necessarily in the right order"
</blockquote>
</p><p>
There are four by-elections, for five seats, on 20th January 2020.  Labour defend three, the Conservatives (who are still looking for their first by-election win of the year) defend one, and there is a free-for-all in a very interesting ward.  We'll start in the Midlands, where Labour defend two seats in the Conservative-held seat of Loughborough:
</p><p>
<h2>Loughborough Shelthorpe</h2>
</p><p>
Charnwood council, Leicestershire; a double by-election caused by the death of Gill Bolton and the resignation of Alice Brennan.  Both were Labour councillors.
</p><p>
For our first poll this week, let's have a day out.  In 1841 a businessman from Leicester organised a tour for a local temperance group in what became the world's first package holiday: the businessman was Thomas Cook, and the destination was Loughborough.  First stabs at business models don't always work, and Loughborough has not proven to be a lasting holiday destination; but the town has been prosperous enough despite that, with a lot of industry in days gone by.  These days a major contributor to the local economy is Loughborough University, one of the UK's premier universities for sports and related studies; although the "How to Beat Australians" module seems to have a rather low pass rate at the moment.
</p><p>
Loughborough is the main town in the Charnwood district of Leicestershire and is divided into ten wards for Charnwood council elections.  Shelthorpe ward is in the south of the town, based on a 1950s council estate along the A6004 road towards Leicester and also taking in the village of Woodthorpe.  However, some housing estates of more recent vintage have sprung up here, and the ward has experienced strong population growth.
</p><p>
The Loughborough parliamentary seat is a traditional marginal in parliamentary elections, and Shelthorpe ward is also consistently marginal: however, in this century the Conservatives have only broken through here once, winning one of the ward's two seats in 2015.  The Labour councillor resigned a couple of years later, and Labour held the resulting by-election (<em>Andrew's Previews 2017</em>, page 214) by just four votes, 595 to 591.
</p><p>
The last Charnwood elections in May 2019 saw Labour gain the Tory seat, although their poll-topping vote share was rather low: 34% for Labour, 23% for the Conservatives, 15% for the Greens, 13% for UKIP.  The ward is divided between the Loughborough South (marginal) and Loughborough South West (safe Conservative) divisions of Leicestershire county council, which were the town's only county divisions to vote Conservative last year.
</p><p>
The losing Labour candidate for Loughborough South last year was Gill Bolton, who subsequently passed away in October.  Her ward colleague Alice Brennan then handed her resignation in the following month, and the by-elections to replace both of them have been combined into one poll.  Both Bolton and Brennan had been first elected in 2019.
</p><p>
Defending for Labour are Anne and Beverley Gray.  Interestingly the Conservatives have only nominated one candidate, Christopher Stewart, who was runner-up here in May 2019; they may be standing down in favour of David Hayes, who was the Conservative councillor for this ward from 2015 to 2019 but has been nominated for this by-election as an independent candidate.  On the Green slate Rachel Baker returns from 2019 and is joined by Faye Forde.  UKIP have not returned, so completing the ballot paper are the Lib Dem slate of Manu Fantaisie and Alex Guerrero.
</p><p>
I regret to report that there have been some serious problems affecting the postal votes in this by-election, which were originally sent out with the Conservative candidate missing.  Stewart is last of the eight candidates alphabetically, and thus should have appeared at the bottom of the ballot paper.  The printers have apologised for the error.  New, yellow postal ballot papers have been sent out.  If you are a postal voter in this election and you have already sent back a white ballot paper, you need to fill out and return the yellow ballot paper as well: it's too late now for this to go through the post, but you can hand in your postal vote to the presiding officer at any polling station in the ward.

<h2>Chapel St Leonards</h2>
</p><p>
East Lindsey council, Lincolnshire; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Paul Hibbert-Greaves.
</p><p>
We now cross to the seaside at Chapel St Leonards, a minor resort on the Lincolnshire coast about five miles north of Skegness.  The beach is sandy, the amusements are tacky and, if the weather holds, there are nice views out to sea to watch what the birds are doing.  Chapel St Leonards has become a favoured place for migrating birds, and the birdwatchers who observe them.  Playing on these themes is the North Sea Observatory, a modern visitor centre (est 2018) which is described as the UK's first marine observatory.
</p><p>
When we change our gaze to look inland at the sort of people who live in Chapel St Leonards, a theme quickly starts to emerge.  In the 2011 census this ward was in the top 30 in England and Wales for the 65-84 age bracket, and just 29% of the population were aged under 45.  For comparison, the median age of a person living in England is 40, according to the most recent estimates.  Possibly connected with this, a massive 49% of the population have no qualifications, which is the fifth-highest figure in England and Wales: for comparison, the four wards with higher figures are the three Mablethorpe wards and the notorious quasi-shanty town of Jaywick.  36% of the population are retired, which is in the top 20 wards in England and Wales.  The words "elephant's graveyard" would not be inappropriate to describe Chapel St Leonards.
</p><p>
It would be difficult to imagine a more Conservative-voting demographic.  However, the Tories are still to get off the mark in this year's local by-elections (both polls in the last two weeks saw the Conservatives lose a seat they were defending), and East Lindsey is one of England's more remote local government districts and has a bit of an independent tradition.  The Conservatives only started standing here in recent years in 2007, when they won one out of two seats, but the independents struck back in 2011.
</p><p>
One long-serving independent councillor for Chapel St Leonards was Philip Leivers, who back in the 1970s had been the manager of the Hammersmith Odeon (now the Hammersmith Apollo) in London.  In 2013 Leivers was charged with a number of sex offences against a child dating from the period when he was managing that theatre.  He was subsequently convicted of three counts of indecency towards a child, with the jury unable to reach a verdict on some other charges; sadly, a retrial had to be called off after the victim suddenly died.  Leivers was sent to prison for four and a half years.  He had resigned from East Lindsey council after being charged, and the resulting by-election in October 2013 saw a freak vote split, with Labour (standing here for the first time in ten years) winning with a large majority but just 33% of the vote.
</p><p>
The Labour councillor lost her seat in 2015, with the Conservatives winning both seats in Chapel St Leonards for the first time this century.  Both Conservative councillors were re-elected in 2019 with a 57-43 margin over Labour.
</p><p>
One of the ward's Conservative councillors, Mel Turton-Leivers (no relation of Philip Leivers), resigned last year.  The resulting by-election was a rather curious one, as I related in Andrew's Previews at the time.  It was contested by a localist group called the Skegness Urban District Society, despite the fact that this area has never been part of Skegness Urban District.  The SUDS had one candidate in the Chapel St Leonards by-election and, due to what appears to be a nomination error, two candidates for the local county council division - one of whom also stood as an independent candidate for the Chapel St Leonards by-election in opposition to the official SUDS candidate.  Confused?  You will be.  The electors were  clearly not impressed by all this, and the resulting by-election was a big win for the new Conservative candidate who enjoyed a 67-17 lead over Labour.
</p><p>
The ward's other Conservative councillor, Paul Hibbert-Greaves, passed away in October resulting in the second Chapel St Leonards by-election in nine months.  This one has a rather simpler candidate list, with just two candidates who are both Chapel St Leonards parish councillors.  Stephen Evans defends for the Conservatives, while David Fenton (who runs a business development and management training firm) challenges as an independent candidate.

<h2>Byram and Brotherton</h2>
</p><p>
Selby council, North Yorkshire; caused by the resignation of Yorkshire Party councillor Eleanor Jordan.
</p><p>
For our northern by-election we have come to a ward which anybody who has travelled on the Yorkshire A1 will have passed through. Generations of travellers will be familiar with Ferrybridge, where the north-south A1 meets the east-west M62 next to a large set of cooling towers.  This was Ferrybridge C power station, which has been recently decommissioned with the loss of some of its cooling towers.
</p><p>
The modern A1(M) motorway passes along the west side of the power station; to its east side is the River Aire, which marks the boundary between West and North Yorkshire, and beyond that are the villages of Byram and Brotherton.  Until the A1(M) motorway was opened in 2006, these villages were divided from each other by all the traffic on the old dual-carriageway A1.  Further north the A1 ran through the middle of the village of Fairburn, bisecting it into two parts linked only by a road bridge and a footbridge.
</p><p>
At the time of the 2011 census this area was part of the two-seat ward of Fairburn with Brotherton, which had a working-class economic profile partly because of its proximity to Kellingly Colliery, the UK's last deep coal mine.  Kellingly closed in December 2015, so this area may well have changed a bit since demographically.  The ward has certainly changed in one respect: boundary changes for the 2015 Selby council election removed two parishes and one councillor, resulting in a name change to Byram and Brotherton.  Fairburn is still part of the ward, so it's not clear why this name change was made.
</p><p>
Anyway, Byram and Brotherton has turned out to be a fascinating ward which has returned councillors from three different parties in its three previous elections.  In 2015 it re-elected Labour councillor Jack Crawford, who died the following year.  The resulting by-election in July 2016 (<em>Andrew's Previews 2016</em>, page 120) was narrowly gained by the Conservatives, with the regionalist party Yorkshire First finishing a poor third.  Their candidate was Chris Whitwood, who has gone on appear in this column in connection with elections to Doncaster and Rotherham councils.
</p><p>
Yorkshire First are now known as the Yorkshire Party, and they made a serious effort at the 2019 general election, standing enough candidates to get a party political broadcast in the Yorkshire TV region.  This came off the back of a particularly good result in the 2019 Selby council elections, where the Yorkshire Party won four seats and the Conservative majority was cut to one.
</p><p>
Two of the Yorkshire Party councillors were former Conservative councillor Mike Jordan and his daughter Eleanor.  Mike is now back in the Tory fold; his ward colleague Paul Welburn resigned from the council, with the Conservatives easily winning the resulting by-election in May 2021; and Eleanor Jordan has now resigned in her turn.  She had gained Byram and Brotherton ward from the Conservative by-election winner in 2019, polling 45% of the vote against 35% for the Conservatives and 20% for Labour.  The remaining Yorkshire Party councillor now sits with the independent group on Selby council.
</p><p>
The ward is part of the Mid Selby division of North Yorkshire county council, which is safely Conservative; however, the 2021 county council elections here were cancelled in advance of a local government reorganisation.  Once that process is finished this area will be ruled not from Selby but from that noted local centre of, er, Northallerton.
</p><p>
There is no defending Yorkshire Party candidate for the Byram and Brotherton by-election.  We have a free-for-all, I repeat we have a free-for-all!  The Conservatives have selected Georgina Ashton, who is the clerk for a number of parish councils in the Selby district.  Standing for Labour is Matthew Burton, the secretary of the party's Selby branch; he is a parish councillor in Monk Fryston, which is not part of this ward.  Completing the ballot paper is Cherry Waters for the Green Party.

<h2>Preston, Seton and Gosford</h2>
</p><p>
East Lothian council, Scotland; caused by the death of the Leader of the Council, Labour councillor Willie Innes.
</p><p>
We finish for the week with the last council by-election in Scotland for some time.  The 2022 Scottish local elections are now less than four months away, and this is the final seat which became vacant before the six-month cutoff to hold by-elections.
</p><p>
Our visit north of the border takes us to a place with a name which will make supporters of Scottish independence take notice.  On the coast of East Lothian, some miles east of Edinburgh, lies the town of Prestonpans which gave its name to an eighteenth-century battle: an early victory for the Jacobite cause in the 1745 rebellion.  The "pans" in the name of Prestonpans refers to salt pans, and in mediaeval times salt was the town's major export.
</p><p>
To the east of Prestonpans lie Cockenzie and Port Seton, which have merged together into a single town.  It used to be easy to identify the town's location from afar because of the presence of the massive Cockenzie Power Station, which opened in 1967 and was demolished in 2015.  The power station, which was the largest coal-fired plant in Britain when it opened, occupied the space between Prestonpans and Cockenzie.
</p><p>
Despite the name, this ward does not include the neoclassical country pile of Gosford House, which is still in the hands of Earl of Wemyss and March (although the present Earl and Countess live elsewhere).  Instead, the other major population centre here is the village of Longniddry.  This is a commuter centre for Edinburgh: Longniddry and Prestonpans both lie on the East Coast Main Line, with regular local trains to Waverley.
</p><p>
Prestonpans may have been a victory for Scottish independence a few centuries ago, but modern-day East Lothian has proven one of the hardest nuts for the SNP to crack.  The East Lothian Holyrood constituency voted Labour in all of the first five Scottish Parliament elections, finally falling to the Nationalists only in 2021.  The East Lothian parliamentary seat, which is larger than the Holyrood seat and has the same boundaries as the council area (thus taking in Musselburgh) was one of the seats Labour took off the SNP in 2017 before losing them back in 2019.  However East Lothian's MP, the former Scottish justice secretary Kenny MacAskill, has subsequently ended up in Alex Salmond's vanity project Alba.
</p><p>
The Labour gain in June 2017 was presaged a month earlier by the May 2017 East Lothian council elections, in which Labour remained the largest party with 9 seats and the SNP fell to third (6 seats) behind the Conservatives (7 seats).  The Tories have since successfully defended a by-election in Haddington and Lammermuir ward (<em>Andrew's Previews 2019</em>, page 143).  A minority Labour administration is in place, and until his death last October it was led by Willie Innes.
</p><p>
Innes was one of the few councillors remaining from before the 1990s reorganisation of Scottish local government, having been first elected in 1988 to what was then East Lothian district council (for Prestonpans East ward).  East Lothian gained unitary status in the 1990s, and the introduction of PR in 2007 created this ward which returns four members of the council.  Innes became leader of the Labour group in 2007, and had served as leader of the council since 2012.
</p><p>
All three elections to date for Preston, Seton and Gosford ward have returned two Labour councillors, with Willie Innes at the top of the poll, and at least one SNP councillor.  The fourth seat went Lib Dem in 2007, the party overtaking the Conservatives in the final round of counting on transfers from an independent candidate; the Lib Dem councillor subsequently defected to the SNP and is now their group leader.  The Lib Dem vote here fell apart in 2012 and the SNP picked their seat up, but the Conservatives took a seat off the SNP in May 2017.  Shares of the vote at that election were 43% for Labour, 28% for the SNP and 24% for the Conservatives.  Rerunning the count for one seat would have resulted in a big win for Innes, with a 63-37 margin over the lead SNP candidate.
</p><p>
So, all eyes will be on this final by-election of the 2017-22 Scottish council term.  Defending for Labour is Colin Yorkston, who was the party's election agent here in May 2017: he is now the chairman of Labour's East Lothian branch, and for his day job he teaches chemistry at a secondary school of Edinburgh.  The SNP have reselected Janis Wilson, who was the runner-up here in May 2017; she is the secretary of Prestonpans community council.  Standing for the Conservatives is Andy Ovens, who runs a financial advisory company.  Completing the ballot paper are Tim Porteus for the Greens, Ben Morse for the Lib Dems and independent candidate Calum Miller, who is in the unusual position for an M of top of the ballot paper.  Remember the usual Scottish advisories: Votes at 16 and the Alternative Vote will be in use, please mark your ballot paper in order of preference.
