One by-election on 25th August 2022:
</p><p>
<h2>Beverley Rural</h2>
</p><p>
East Riding council, East Yorkshire; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Pauline Greenwood.
</p><p>
The summer break is nearly over and many political campaigners, from the Prime Minister downwards, are on holiday.  August is not a popular time to hold a local by-election and just eight polls were scheduled for this month.  Today's by-election is the last of these.
</p><p>

</p><p>
We have come to the centre of the East Riding of Yorkshire.  Beverley Rural ward is a far-flung ward of fourteen parishes which surrounds the town of Beverley on the east, north and west sides.  Pretty much any village within about eight miles of Beverley is included here.  The ward's three councillors represent a population of over 14,000 - also very large by English standards but typical of East Riding council, whose original electoral arrangements from the 1990s were closely based on the previous Humberside county council divisions.
</p><p>
The largest of the fourteen parishes is Leven, located about seven miles east of Beverley with a population of around 2,500; this is over five times what the headcount of the parish was in the early 1960s, before Leven started to greatly expand as a dormitory centre for Hull and Beverley.  Until a bypass was built in the 1990s, Leven was on the main road from Hull to Bridlington.  Walkington lies about three miles west of Beverley on the road towards South Cave and the M62 motorway; this village was once home to Broadgate Hospital, an asylum whose site has now been redeveloped for housing.
</p><p>
To the north of Beverley on the road towards Driffield is the other village here of over 2,000 souls, Leconfield.  That headcount may well be boosted by the presence of the military: Leconfield was home to an RAF base until the 1970s, and since then the Defence School of Transport has trained drivers here for the Royal Marines, the Army and the RAF.  Leconfield parish also includes the ward's railhead, the little-used Arram railway station on the Hull and Scarborough line.  Arram station served fewer than a hundred passengers in the lockdown-affected year of 2020-21, but it is still open and was one of the few stations mentioned in Flanders and Swann's <em>Slow Train</em> which survived the Beeching Axe.
</p><p>
The countryside here is diverse, climbing from the flatlands around the River Hull into the Yorkshire Wolds to the west of Beverley.  The demographics here are not so diverse, with a clear pattern of Beverley Rural's residents commuting to Beverley and Hull.  The ward is consistently in the top half of the deprivation indices and has high levels of owner-occupation.
</p><p>
Beverley Rural ward has returned a full slate of Conservative councillors since the current boundaries were introduced, and until 2019 it was the political home of the long-serving council leader Stephen Parnaby.  Parnaby led East Riding council for its first 23 years, from 1995 to 2018, and had been leader of Beverley council for five years before that.  All three ward councillors retired at the 2019 East Riding elections, and a completely new Conservative slate was elected with 45% of the vote against 23% for the Liberal Democrats and 20% for the Green Party.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/e-riding19.png" alt="E Riding, 2019" />
</p><p>
The only polls here since then have been the December 2019 general election, for which this ward is part of the safe Conservative seat of Beverley and Holderness; and the May 2021 election for Humberside police and crime commissioner.  This is the third time in four months that Andrew's Previews has been in the East Riding, and both of those by-elections resulted in the Conservatives losing a seat to the Lib Dems; they might fancy their chances of a hat-trick here.
</p><p>
This by-election follows the death of Conservative councillor Pauline Greenwood in June at the age of 86.  Greenwood had been first elected in 2019, coming to politics late in life after working as a farmer and in catering and hospitality: her bed and breakfast in the village of Cherry Burton had won a Michelin award.  Greenwood had been elected as vice-chair of East Riding council in May in rather messy circumstances, with the vote being re-run after Conservative abstentions led to a Lib Dem councillor originally winning that post.
</p><p>
Defending for the Conservatives, and in the unusual position for an S of top of the ballot paper, is Peter Stevens who is the deputy chairman (political) of the party's Beverley and Holderness branch.  The Lib Dems have reselected Diana Stewart who stood here in 2019; she is a retired nurse from the village of North Newbald, in the south-west corner of this ward, and she sits on Newbald parish council.  There is no Green candidate this time, so Labour's Clare Wildey completes the ballot paper.

<h2>The Cursing Stone</h2>
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/cursing-stone.jpg" />
</p><p>
Since it's a slow week, we've time to revisit one of the recurring themes of this column: the Cursing Stone.  This is a piece of artwork which shelters in a pedestrian subway in Carlisle city centre, just outside Carlisle Castle, and it has cursed the city since its installation in 2001.  That year's foot-and-mouth disease outbreak, Carlisle United's relegation from the Football League, a series of devastating floods and even a national biscuit shortage (a result of one of the floods taking out the McVitie's factory) have all been blamed on the Cursing Stone.
</p><p>
The Stone has also cursed the local councillors who represent it.  It is located within the Castle division of Cumbria county council, whose local councillor Jim Tootle recognised the power of the curse and tried to get the Cursing Stone removed in 2005.  The council voted to keep it.  Tootle died suddenly in 2011, aged just 59; and he was not alone in being a Castle ward councillor whose political career came to a sudden end.
</p><p>
In fact, in the 21 years since the Cursing Stone was installed there have been ten by-elections in Castle ward at either county council or Carlisle city council level.  Tootle's successor as county councillor, Willie Whalen, died in 2014 at the age of 67; city councillor for Castle ward Gerald Caig died in 2016 at the age of 64 (<em>Andrew's Previews 2016</em>, page 192); city councillor for Castle ward Barrie Osgood was forced to resign later that year over a fraudulent Housing Benefit claim (<em>Andrew's Previews 2016</em>, page 294); and city councillor for the redrawn Cathedral and Castle ward Christopher Robinson resigned in 2021 (<em>Andrew's Previews 2021</em>, page 72) after a serious falling-out with the council's deputy leader (<a href="https://www.newsandstar.co.uk/news/18166306.carlisle-councillor-hot-water-amid-bust-up-claims-city-council-chamber/">link</a>), who was subsequently sanctioned over his behaviour (<a href="https://www.newsandstar.co.uk/news/19611279.deputy-leader-carlisle-city-council-sanctioned-emailing-former-councillors-work/">link</a>).
</p><p>
The latest manifestation of the Curse has affected Alan McGuckin, who has been the county councillor here since winning the 2014 by-election to replace Willie Whelan.  McGuckin was thrown out of the Labour Party earlier this month for interacting on Facebook with Left Labour Alliance, a group which has been banned by the national party (<a href="https://www.newsandstar.co.uk/news/20618604.veteran-carlisle-councillor-labour-witch-hunt-claims/">link</a>).  This has not gone down well in the local party, with ten of the 11 executive members of Labour's Penrith and the Border branch resigning in protest.
</p><p>
McGuckin is still an independent member of Cumbria county council, and even if he were to resign over this it's highly unlikely that a by-election would follow.  Cumbria county council and Carlisle city council are due for abolition next April, and there are a couple of seats on those councils which have been vacant for some months now without a by-election being called.  These include the city council seat previously held by independent councillor Jack Paton, whose by-election win in January 2016 was the first poll covered in the first <em>Andrew's Previews</em> book (<em>2016</em>, page 11).  Alan McGuckin is not a member of the recently-elected Cumberland council which will take over the area's local government next year.  However, you never know what the future might hold so this column will keep an eye on Carlisle - and the Cursing Stone - in case of further developments.
