One by-election on 13th January 2022:

<h2>The Littletons</h2>

Wychavon council, Worcestershire; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Richard Lasota.

After last week's surprisingly-exciting by-election in the Nottingham suburbs, we move to the Vale of Evesham for the second council by-election of 2022.  The Littletons are three villages - South Littleton, Middle Littleton and North Littleton - which can be found a few miles to the north-east of Evesham; the ward named after the three villages also takes in the village of Cleeve Prior to the north.

The largest of these villages is South Littleton, with 1,115 electors on the roll.  South Littleton's population, however, is much larger than this.  That's because the parish includes HM Prison Long Lartin, a maximum-security men's prison which houses some of the UK's most notorious offenders.  The prison has a capacity of 622, and in 2017 it was reported that two-thirds of Long Lartin's inmates were serving life sentences.  None of these people have the right to vote during their incarceration, although the presence of the prison may account for The Littletons ward appearing in the top 50 wards in England and Wales for the "Inactive: Other" category of economic activity.

There's a surprising amount of industry here for such a rural location.  Next to Long Lartin prison is part of the large Unipart Logistics base at Honeybourne, which spills over into this ward; in fact the main warehouse on the site straddles the ward boundary.  Unipart started off as the parts and services division of British Leyland, and is one of the larger players in the UK's supply chain: the Honeybourne base is kept busy distributing parts to the automotive industry.  However, in jobs terms it is eclipsed by the Kanes Foods factory in Middle Littleton: Kanes, which prepares and supplies fresh food products, advertises itself as the largest private employer in Worcestershire.

In between all these there are now very few people here employed in agriculture, which was the mainstay of the ward's economy within living memory.  Middle Littleton's tithe barn, which was built for Evesham Abbey in the 14th century or earlier and is one of the largest tithe barns in England, is now in the hands of the National Trust and open to the public.

The Littletons is a Conservative ward in elections to Wychavon council, which covers most of eastern Worcestershire including the towns of Evesham, Pershore (where the council is based) and Droitwich.  However, it's not the Tory monolith you might expect from looking at this May's result in the Littletons division of Worcestershire county council (which covers a larger area).  In 2007, Conservative ward councillor Mary Smith was challenged by independent Richard Lasota; they split the right-wing vote, allowing the Liberal Democrats to come through the middle of a close three-way result to win.  In 2011 Lasota secured the Conservative nomination and defeated the Lib Dems by a 55-45 margin.  Lasota's last re-election in 2019 was also by a 55-45 margin, but on that occasion the Green Party were his only challengers.  One thing which local by-election watchers may have noticed at the back end of last year is some very good performances which have put in by the Green Party in odd-looking places, some of wich aren't too dissimilar to The Littletons ward.  With the recent Green track record here, this by-election should be watched closely.

Away from the council Richard Lasota had run Happy Little Sole, the fish and chip shop in South Littleton, until it closed down in January 2020 after receiving a one-star rating in a food hygiene inspection.  Shortly before his death Lasota had been appointed as chairman of the local non-league football team, Littleton FC.  He passed away in September at the age of 71.

Defending for the Conservatives is Mary Smith, seeking to make a return to Wychavon council some years after losing her seat in 2007.  Smith works as a teaching assistant and is the vice-chairman of Cleeve Prior parish council.  The Green Party have selected Hannah Robson, who gives an address in South Littleton.  Completing the ballot paper is David Quayle for the Lib Dems, giving The Littletons ward its first three-way contest since 2007.
