North East

Sunderland council has seen huge Labour losses in 2019 and 2021, and we are now at the point where the Labour majority is in danger.  Following a by-election gain by Labour in March, the council has 43 Labour councillors, 19 Conservatives, 12 Lib Dems, and one independent who was elected as UKIP.  A repeat of the 2021 results would see Labour lose five seats Doxford and Hendon wards to the Lib Dems, and Ryhope, St Anne's and Washington South wards to the Conservatives: that would give 38 Labour seats and a majority of one.

The other North East council to watch is Hartlepool, whose entire representation was up in 2021: the parliamentary seat was a historic Conservative by-election gain, while the party may also be ruing its decision not to stand more candidates in the Hartlepool council election.  The whole council was up for election on new ward boundaries, and the Conservative dominance in the ward map only netted them 13 seats out of 36: there are 12 independent and/or localist councillors and 11 Labour members, giving a very balanced council.  There is little scope for Labour gains as the party are defending seven of the 13 seats up for election this year; holding what they have got will be a decent result.

The Labour mayor of North Tyneside is not due for re-election until 2024 and the Labour majorities in the four other Tyne and Wear councils are impregnable.  There have, however, been some ructions within the ruling Labour group in Newcastle upon Tyne, where the outgoing council leader Nick Forbes was deselected by his local party.  Another senior Newcastle Labour figure leaving the stage this year is the former council leader Lord Beecham, who is standing down after 55 unbroken years' service on the city council.  There are very few councillors left now from before the 1974 reorganisation.

North West

We move west to Cumbria, whose local government is being reogranised this year.  Cumbria county council and the six district councils under it are being dissolved next year, and the two successor unitary councils which will replace them in April 2023 hold their first elections.

The new Cumberland council takes in nearly all of the old county of that name, running from Millom through Whitehaven, Workington and past Carlisle all the way up to the Scottish border; the only major part of old Cumberland missing from the new council is the Penrith area.  That is included within the new district of Westmorland and Furness, which covers the south of the county and takes in Kendal, Windermere, Ulverston and Barrow.

For the 2022 election Cumberland council is reusing the current electoral divisions for Cumbria county council.  This last went to the polls in 2017, in which year Cumbria was the only county council not to return a Conservative majority.  A Labour/Lib Dem coalition is in power at the county hall in Carlisle.  The 2017 county elections returned 21 Conservatives, 18 Labour, five independents and two Lib Dems within the new Cumberland council area; the Conservatives subsequently gained two seats in by-elections last year to give them 23 out of 46.  The Conservatives also run all three of the outgoing Cumberland district councils.  They are one seat short of a majority in Carlisle, run a minority administration in Allerdale (Workington, Keswick and the Solway coast) where Labour collapsed in 2019, and have also recruited the elected mayor of Copeland Mike Starkie to their banner: Starkie was elected in 2015 and re-elected in 2019 as an independent candidate.  His mayoralty will disappear with Copeland council, and he is not seeking election to the new council.

The inaugural Cumberland council election will be combined with two by-elections to the old structure.  One of these is for the <a href="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/itqv">Longtown and the Border</a> ward of Carlisle council, a massive area which stretches the length of the Cumbria-Scotland border.  The only large centre of population here is Longtown, a crossing-point of the River Esk on the A7 road from Carlisle towards Hawick.  This is a

Westmorland and Furness council has the look of somewhere which is likely to be hung for quite a long time.  The 2017 county elections here returned 16 Conservative councillors, 14 Liberal Democrats and 8 Labour; the Conservatives lost a by-election in Ulverston West to the Green Party last year.  New ward boundaries have been drawn up for this new council, so these figures may not be comparable.  Nearly all of the Labour vote here comes out of Barrow-in-Furness, where they have a large majority on the outgoing council and where the Lib Dems are not organised.  The deeply-rural and sparsely-populated Eden council, covering the area around Penrith and Appleby beyond Shap Fell and the Lune Gorge, has an anti-Conservative coalition in place under a Lib Dem leader; and the Liberal Democrats are in majority control of the largest of the outgoing districts, South Lakeland.  Much of South Lakeland forms the Westmorland and Lonsdale constituency of the former Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron, and for the Conservatives to get a majority here they will need to find some way of defeating his political machine - which is easier said then done, given that the Tories have been trying to do that for two decades now.

In Lancashire there are elections this year for one-third of Pendle, Burrnley, Rossendale, Hyndburn, Blackburn with Darwen, Chorley, West Lancashire and Preston councils.  Pendle got new ward boundaries last year and the all-out elections returned a Conservative majority; however, that has disappeared going into these elections as two Conservative seats are vacant and one of their councillors has defected to Labour.  Nelson is like that.  There are four wards with split representation, of which the Conservatives are only defending one (Waterside and Horsfield ward in Colne).

Burnley council is a right old mess.  The latest composition has 18 Labour councillors, 9 Conservatives, 8 Lib Dems, 5 Greens and 5 councillors from the Burnley and Padiham Independent Party.  A coalition of Labour and the Liberal Democrats is in place.  Seats have flown in all directions here over the last few years, but a repeat of the 2021 results would see Labour lose two seats and the Lib Dems lose one, leaving the ruling coalition with a majority of one.

Further down the M65 motorway we come to Hyndburn district, based on Accrington and its satellite towns, which is on a knife-edge.  Currently Labour have 19 seats (one of which is vacant) against 12 Conservatives and 4 independents (most of whom were elected as Labour).  The main ward to watch here is St Oswald's ward in Oswaldtwistle, which is where the vacant seat is: the Conservatives and Labour are defending one seat each there.  Also keep an eye on Overton ward in Great Harwood, which voted Conservative in 2019 but Labour in 2021, and Labour are defending it this year.  If Labour lose both of those seats, their majority on the council will likely disappear.

Over the West Pennine Moors we have Rossendale council, covering the small towns at the head of the Irwell valley.  This is hung with a minority Labour administration in place after the party lost its majority last year: there are currently 17 Labour councillors, 13 Conservatives, three independents, 2 Community First councillors in Whitworth, and a Green.  Rossendale is a very swingy council where almost no ward is safe; and Labour are only defending five seats this year.  Last Labour they won eight seats on Rossendale council and made gains here on the county council, and a repeat of those results would deliver three gains and a Labour majority.

Labour have large majorities in Blackburn with Darwen and in Chorley.  The Labour majority on Preston council is smaller but just as secure.

Our final council in modern Lancashire is West Lancashire, based on Ormskirk, the rural area east of Southport and the New Town of Skelmersdale.  West Lancashire council has some of the country's most polarised election results, but politics here has become interesting in recent years thanks to the growth of the OWLs - a localist party whose initials stand for Our West Lancashire.  Labour lost control here in 2021 and now run a minority administration with, 23 seats against 19 Conservatives, 7 OWLs and 3 independents (two of whom were elected as Labour councillors).  Labour are defending ten seats this year, including difficult defences in Ormskirk and Burscough; the Conservatives should take back the rural North Meols ward next to Southport, which surprisingly voted Labour in 2018.  This could be one to watch.

There are some major changes to Merseyside's local elections this year, as all the seats on St Helens council up for election on new ward boundaries while the Liverpool council elections have been cancelled.  Both of those councils are moving to whole elections every four years.  Labour have secure majorities in St Helens, Knowsley and Sefton and run Wirral council as a minority, with 28 Labour seats (one of which is vacant) against 23 Conservatives, 7 Green seats (one of which is vacant), 6 Lib Dems and 2 ex-Labour independents.  If the 2021 results are repeated Labour will lose three seats: Bebington and Prenton wards to the Greens, and Pensby and Thingwall ward to the Conservatives.

Moving over to Greater Manchester, it's time yet again to talk about the Greatest Town in the Known Universe.  I swear, every time I talk about my town's politics things get more complicated.  It's only just over four years since I wrote in this column that "it's surprising ... that nobody has previously tried to form a localist party in Bolton borough given its residents' reputation for insularity" (<em>Andrew's Previews 2018</em>, page 98).  What happened next?

Well, the last three local elections in Bolton have returned 24 Conservative councillors, 21 Labour, 6 Farnworth and Kearsley First, 5 Lib Dems, 3 Horwich and Blackrod First, and 1 UKIP councillor.  The latest composition on the council website gives 22 Conservatives (1 elected as Horwich and Blackrod First), 17 Labour, 5 Liberal Democrat, 4 Farnworth and Kearsley First, 4 independents (2 elected as Labour, 1 as Conservative, 1 as UKIP), 2 Crompton Independents (both elected as Labour), 2 Bolton Independent Group (both elected as Conservatives), 2 Horwich and Blackrod First, 1 Bolton for Change councillor (who was elected as Farnworth and Kearsley First) and 1 One Kearsley councillor (who was also elected as Farnworth and Kearsley First).  The Conservatives run Bolton council as a minority, making the Greatest Town the only Conservative-controlled metropolitan borough in the north of England.

There's nothing to suggest that Bolton Labour are going to pick themselves up off the floor any time soon.  A repeat of last year's result would deliver two Conservative gains (from an ex-Labour independent in your columnist's own Little Lever and Darcy Lever, and from the Lib Dems in Westhoughton South), offset by a Conservative loss to Horwich and Blackrod First in Horwich and Blackrod ward.  The localists continue to multiply: as well as the Placename First parties (which are joined this year by Little Lever and Darcy Lever First), Bolton for Change are contesting most wards on a joint ticket with Reform UK.  The One Kearsley councillor is also seeking re-election under that label meaning that the lucky voters of Kearsley ward can choose between three different localists in addition to the three main parties.

The localist surge of recent years has also spilled over into Bury, which now has a slim Labour majority: 28 seats against 15 Conservatives, 4 Lib Dems, 3 councillors from Radcliffe First and an ex-Conservative independent.  The whole of Bury council is up this year on new ward boundaries, although the basic pattern of the wards is very much the same as before and the changes amount to minor tinkering around the edges.  In 2021 Labour won 8 wards to 6 Conservatives, 2 Radcliffe First and a Lib Dem, so control of the council is very much up for grabs.  The Labour path to a majority runs through holding their seats in Elton, Radcliffe East and Radcliffe West wards; the Tories will need to gain Ramsbottom, Redvales and Unsworth wards for overall control, and having to disendorse one of their Redvales candidates for anti-Semitism does not help with that.

Oldham council deserves a mention here following some rather disturbing goings-on.  The outgoing Labour council leader lost his seat that year in Failsworth to a localist party following an acrimonious campaign, and his replacement as leader Arooj Shah had her car firebombed last year.  The council has a large Labour majority (40 out of 60 seats) which is unlikely to be overturned.

For the prospect of changes in control we should look to Stockport council, where the Liberal Democrats became the largest party last year but Labour are running a minority administration with Conservative support.  The latest composition has 26 Lib Dem councillors, 25 Labour, 8 Conservatives, 3 Heald Green Ratepayers and a Green councillor.  A repeat of the 2021 results here would see Labour losing Reddish South to the Green Party, with other seat changes cancelling each other out.

The only elections in Cheshire this year are for one-third of Halton council (Runcorn and Widnes), which has a large Labour majority.

<h2>Yorkshire and Humberside</h2>

In Yorkshire we have elections for the whole of North Yorkshire county council on new division boundaries, for one third of Barnsley, Hull, Sheffield, and all the West Yorkshire boroughs, and for the elected mayoralty of South Yorkshire.

Formerly known as the Sheffield City Region mayoralty, the South Yorkshire post has been held since 2018 by Dan Jarvis, who is also the Labour MP for Barnsley Central.  Jarvis came close to winning in the first round, polling 48% of the first preferences against 15% for the Conservatives and 11% for the Liberal Democrats; he picked up the lion's share of the transfers to thrash the Conservatives 74-26 in the runoff.

During Jarvis' term the South Yorkshire mayoralty has been significantly beefed up, with new powers over transport, strategic planning and suchlike together with a salary.  Jarvis has decided to concentrate on his Westminster role and he is not seeking re-election as mayor.

The Labour selection has fallen on Oliver Coppard, who came close to defeating the Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg in Sheffield Hallam at the 2015 general election; unfortunately he wasn't available when the 2017 snap election was called and the constituency ended up with Jared O'Mara instead.  Coppard is currently chairman of the trustees of Sheffield Hallam students' union.  The Conservative candidate is Clive Watkinson, who runs a furniture retailer in Barnsley and is a director of Barnsley and Rotherham Chamber of Commerce.  The Liberal Democrats have selected Sheffield councillor Joe Otten.  Also standing are Simon Biltcliffe for the Yorkshire Party, Bex Whyman for the Green Party and David Bettney for the Social Democratic Party.

The largest component of the South Yorkshire mayoral area is the city of Sheffield, which went into no overall control in 2021.  There are currently 40 Labour councillors, 29 Lib Dems, 13 Greens, 1 Conservative (from Stocksbridge, rather than the middle-class bits of Hallam) and 1 ex-Labour independent.  Labour and the Greens are currently running the council in coalition.  A repeat of the 2021 results would see Labour fall further from a majority, mostly to the benefit of the Greens.

Moving into West Yorkshire, we need to have a word about Wakefield where there is a parliamentary by-election pending following the disgrace of Conservative MP Imran Ahmed Khan.  Andrew's Previews will of course give you all the lowdown on that in due course, although the history of the seat may well prove very difficult to follow as the Wakefield constituency seems to have been a favourite target of the Boundary Commission through the decades.  You have been warned.

The Wakefield seat as currently drawn is the most Conservative part of Wakefield district, which also takes in Pontefract, Castleford and the former coalfield area around Hemsworth.  In 2018 the Conservatives won five wards in the district, three of which are in the Wakefield constituency.  A repeat of the 2021 results would see the Conservatives gain three seats nett and the Lib Dems gain one, which would still leave Labour (who go into this election with 44 out of 63 seats) with a large majority.

West Yorkshire's only hung council is Kirklees, which has a minority Labour administration with 33 out of 69 seats.  The opposition is made up of 19 Conservatives, 9 Lib Dems, 3 Greens and 5 independent councillors.  If the 2021 results are repeated then the Liberal Democrats would lose two seats in Huddersfield to the Conservatives.

The Lib Dems have better prospects in the city of Kingston upon Hull, which is on a knife-edge.  There are currently 29 Labour councillors, 26 Lib Dems, a single Conservative and a single independent giving a Labour majority of one.  If the Lib Dems can repeat last year's performance, they will take overall control of the council.

Finally, we have the delayed election to North Yorkshire county council, which returned a Conservative majority at the last elections in 2017: 55 Conservatives against 10 independents, 4 Labour and 3 Lib Dem councils.  There are new division boundaries this year with an increase from 72 councillors to 90.  As a result of local government reorganisation the county council will become North Yorkshire's unitary council in April 2023, with all the district councils underneath it disappearing.  The Tories were much weaker here in the 2019 district council elections: Scarborough council is run by a Labour-Independent coalition, Ryedale by a Lib Dem-independent arrangement, Richmondshire by an independent-led anti-Conservative coalition.  The Conservatives do, however, have majorities in Selby, Hambleton and Harrogate districts and hold half of the seats in Craven.

<h2>East Midlands</h2>

This is a quiet part of the electoral cycle in the East Midlands, with just four councils holding elections.  Two of these - Amber Valley and Derby - are holding their last thirds election before moving onto the whole-council cycle from 2023 onwards.

The Conservatives performed very well in Amber Valley last year, and now have a large majority on the council with 28 seats against 15 Labour, 1 Green and 1 "Socialist".  Half of the Labour group is up for re-election this year so there is no prospect of a Labour strikeback.

Derby council is hung with a minority Conservative administration running the city on 21 seats.  The opposition is made up of 13 Labour councillors, 9 Lib Dems, 5 councillors from Reform Derby (who are ex-UKIP and are contesting this election on a joint ticket with Reform UK) and three independents.  The Conservatives performed well here in 2018 and they have eight seats to defend this year with few prospects of gains, so Derby will stay in No Overall Control.

The other East Midlands councils up this year are the city of Lincoln, which has a Labour majority, and North East Lincolnshire where the Conservatives ran riot last year.  These will not change hands.
