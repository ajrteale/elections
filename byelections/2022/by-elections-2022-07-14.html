Before we start this week, there is a special announcement to make:

<h2>Andrew's Previews 2021</h2>

It's finally here!  The 2021 collection of Andrew's Previews is now out in paperback for your reading pleasure.  As with the five previous books in the series, this is a republication of all the Andrew's Previews articles for 2021 with edits for spelling, grammar and factual erors.  There is also some previously unpublished material.

Andrew's Previews has developed quite a readership.  Jo Stevens, the Shadow Welsh Secretary, thought that the recent Wakefield Parliamentary Special was "a great read". Michael Thrasher talked in your columnist's hearing about "wonderful reports".  Another academic, Paula Surridge (co-author of the Nuffield study <em>The British General Election of 2019</em>) said:

<blockquote>
Reading the tea-leaves on Westminster by elections is dangerous, for local by elections even more so, but you won't find a better way to engage in this dangerous behaviour than by following these previews.
</blockquote>

These books serve as a permanent record of the Previews in a world where online archives can and do disappear in an instant.  And buying a copy of the books is also an excellent way to support future Previews, while having a permanent reminder of your donation in the form of a pretty teal volume on your bookshelves.

<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1999834550">Andrew's Previews 2021 is available now from Amazon (link).</a>

If you're not convinced by the description or the testimonials above, this week's Previews are an excellent illustration of the sort of thing you might expect to find in the <em>Andrew's Previews 2021</em> or previous books in the series (which go back to 2016).  In fact, the first two of this week's Previews are repeats of wards which were covered in 2021, and the first ward of this week features prominently on the back cover...

<h2>Camperdown</h2>

North Tyneside council, Tyne and Wear; caused by the disqualification of Labour councillor Jim Allan, who failed to attend any meetings of the council in six months.

Back in September last year, your columnist had a trip booked to London which fell through.  Rather than waste my leave, I decided on a whim to head north instead for a few days in Northumberland.  On the way up I spent some time on Hadrian's Wall visiting Vindolanda, a well-excavated Roman fort built in the shape of a playing-card, with gates to each point of the compass and the major buildings tucked away in the centre.

Vindolanda was by no means the last new settlement in what became Northumberland.  The name of Camperdown ward recalls another one, a small pit village a few miles north of Newcastle which got its name at the end of the 18th century.  The original Kamperduin is a village in the Netherlands which gave its name to a British naval victory over the Dutch in 1797, a much-needed boost for the Royal Navy after the fiascos of the Spithead and Nore Mutinies earlier that year.

Not far to the south-east of Camperdown lay Killingworth Village.  This was also home to a colliery, and a pioneering one at that.  In 1804 a young man called George Stephenson started work at Killingworth Colliery, as a brakeman controlling the winding gear.  It was at Killingworth that Stephenson mastered the art of making steam-driven machinery: his first locomotive, <em>Bl√ºcher</em>, was built here in 1814 to haul coal wagons along the Killingworth Wagonway down to the Tyne at Wallsend.  The Killingworth Wagonway had cast-iron rails 4 feet 8 inches apart; with the addition of an extra half-inch, this became the standard gauge used today in railways across the world.

George Stephenson also designed his own miner's safety lamp, resulting in a lifelong dispute with Humphrey Davy whose own design of safety lamp came out at the same time.  Stephenson's design, named after him as the "Geordia lamp", became standard in the north-east collieries; its prevalence may be one reason why people from Newcastle are to this day called Geordies.

Much has changed in the Killingworth area since Stephenson's day.  In the 1960s the colliery land between Killingworth Village and Camperdown was filled by Northumberland county council with a quasi-New Town, originally called Killingworth Township and now simply known as Killingworth.  Like Vindolanda but on a grander scale, it was built in the shape of a playing-card with roads in and out at the centre of each long edge, and the major buildings tucked away in a citadel at the centre: a modern shopping mall and a 1960s library/health centre/community venue/council office building called the White Swan Centre.

As originally built, Killingworth had rather a lot of modernist high-rise tower blocks, most of which have since gone: the White Swan Centre is an exception to that rule, but even it isn't as tall as it used to be.  Another 1960s survivor is the former British Gas Research Station, which was once Killingworth's major employer; it is now occupied by the council and is a listed building.  If you want to see what a typical Killingworth home of the 1970s looked like, the BBC have a helpful record: Bob and Thelma Ferris' home in <em>Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads?</em> is in Killingworth.

When your columnist visited Killingworth last September, the White Swan Centre was also being used as a COVID-19 vaccination centre and as a polling station.  This is the photograph that graces the back cover of <em>Andrew's Previews 2021</em> - for what better way can there be to sum up that mad year?

Which brings us to politics.  Since the 1970s this area has been outside the Northumberland county council area as part of the metropolitan borough of North Tyneside.  The Camperdown ward, drawn up on its current boundaries for the 2004 local elections, covers the western half of Killingworth together with the villages of Camperdown itself, Burradon and Fordley to the north.  This is quite a deprived area with large amounts of social housing even now, and Camperdown forms a safe Labour ward of the council.

The by-election here last year (<em>Andrew's Previews 2021</em>, page 364) followed the death of long-serving Labour councillor Ray Glindon, who was the husband of the North Tyneside MP Mary Glindon and the council's cabinet member for finance.  The new Labour candidate Tracy Hallway had no trouble winning the by-election, enjoying a 67-25 lead over the Conservatives.  The ordinary North Tyneside elections here two months ago turned in a very similar result with a 68-24 Labour lead.

This by-election is to replace another long-standing councillor.  Jim Allan was first elected to North Tyneside council in 1983, originally representing a ward in Wallsend before moving here in 2003.  Unfortunately Allan is now in poor health, and because of this he has not attended a council meeting since November.  Accordingly, in May he was disqualified from the council for not turning up to any meetings in six months.

Defending this by-election for Labour is Peter Earley, who is an HR consultant and a former member of North Tyneside's cabinet: Earley represented Benton ward on the council from 2014 until May this year, when he left office after being deselected by the local party.  This should be a quick return for him.  The Conservative candidate is Haylee Josendale, who contested Northumberland ward (in Wallsend) in May.  Also standing are Michael Newton for the Green Party, Jay Beyer for the Lib Dems and Jack Thomson for UKIP.

<h2>Overton</h2>

Hyndburn council, Lancashire; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Michael Hindley.

It's now seven years since Andrew's Previews last covered a by-election in Hyndburn, the Lancashire local government district based on Accrington and a number of small towns which surround it.  Today we're in the northernmost of those small towns, Great Harwood.  This is a classic small Lancshire textile centre which lies on ground sloping down to the River Calder in the south, and it has played its part in the development of the cotton industry.  John Mercer, a nineteenth-century figure who was born and died in Great Harwood, was a chemist who worked out a process for treating cotton to increase its strength and make it easier to dye; this process is still called mercerisation, after him.  A clocktower in Great Harwood still bears Mercer's name.

For Hyndburn council elections Great Harwood is divided into two wards called Netherton and Overton.  As the name suggests, Overton ward is the uphill part of the town; it's also very much the whiter part of the town.  Great Harwood has a fair-sized population of Asian heritage like many Lancashire textile centres, but the local Asians are concentrated in Netherton ward.

The four industrial districts of East Lancashire - Pendle, Burrnley, Rossendale and Hyndburn - are all politically-marginal areas with Conservative MPs at present.  In local elections they are very different to each other.  Pendle and Burrnley have large Lib Dem contingents on their local councils, and Burrnley has also been fertile ground for samller parties for many years; by contrast Rossendale and Hyndburn local elections are classic two-party contests with the occasional independent councillor.  Rossendale is very politically swingy, but Hyndburn council has had only two leaders in the last nineteen years.  Peter Britcliffe ran the council for the Conservatives from 2003 until Labour won a majority in 2011, and Miles Parkinson has been leader of Hyndburn council since then.  Following the 2019 elections Labour were in a strong position here, with a 26-9 lead over the Conservatives.

Since 1976 Hyndburn council has had only three years under No Overall Control, and this year is the third of them.  This is partly due to Labour losses in recent elections (the Conservatives made two net gains on the council in May) and partly due to the Labour group comprehensively falling apart.  Over the last few months a number of Labour councillors have quit the party, notably council leader Parkinson who told March's full council meeting that the Hyndburn branch of the party had become "unpleasant, bullying and vindictive".  He is now an independent.  Several defections later, Hyndburn now stands at 14 Conservative councillors, 13 Labour and seven independents: Miles Parkinson remains council leader, but his cabinet now consists of Conservative and other independent councillors.

March's Hyndburn council meeting wasn't even the most dramatic this year.  Duing a break in February's full council budget meeting, there was an unpleasant incident in which former Conservative councillor Gareth Molineux (who had defected from Labour some time previously) was physically attacked in the public gallery by Labour councillor Michael Hindley.  Hindley accepted a police caution, and resigned from the council shortly before May's election; this by-election is to replace him.  It's a sad way to end to a long political career: Michael Hindley was a Labour leader of Hyndburn council from 1981 to 1984, and later that year he was elected to the European Parliament by gaining the Lancashire East constituency from the Conservatives.  Hindley served three terms in Strasbourg, retiring in 1999.

Which brings us to the politics of Overton ward, which in normal circumstances is a closely-fought marginal.  The current ward boundaries date from 2002, and it voted Conservative on that occasion and (with the exception of a July 2005 by-election) until 2008.  In 2010 an independent councillor gained the ward from the Conservatives without Labour opposition.  In 2011 the outgoing Conservative councillor stood for re-election on a breakaway "Independents in Hyndburn" ticket, split the Conservative vote, and Labour (the aforementioned Gareth Molineux) came through the middle to win.  Labour gained the second Conservative seat in 2012 very convincingly, and got all three seats in 2014 by defeating the independent councillor (who stood for re-election as UKIP) by nine votes.

Since then the ward has generally been Labour, but normally with low majorities.  Gareth Molineux lost his seat to the Conservatives in 2019, but the Tories somehow failed to make a second gain in 2021 when the national scene was much more favourable to them.  Perhaps it didn't help that Molineux was by now the Conservative candidate, and that Labour had selected Michael Hindley for a return to the council; Hindley won by 89 votes.  Despite the shenanigans over Councillor Hindley Overton ward then swung strongly to Labour this year, voting 52% Labour and 36% Conservative in a result completely out of kilter with the last few years.  Reform UK, in a rare local election outing, were the only other party to stand.

At Lancashire county council level the ward is part of the large Great Harwood, Rishton and Clayton-le-Moors county division which is just as marginal and closely-fought; in May 2021 it split its two seats between the Conservatives and Labour.  The losing Conservative candidate on that occasion was Gareth Molineux, and his selection on the Tory slate led to Overton ward's Conservative councillor Patrick McGinley quitting the party, and McGinley remains an independent member of the council.  McGinlay had also had a falling-out with former Tory council leader Peter Britcliffe, who still chairs the local Conservative party branch.  Peter's daughter Sara, the young Conservative MP for Hyndburn who gained her seat from Labour in December 2019, is sitting on a majority of 2,951 votes and will have the task of defending a key marginal seat at the next Westminster election.

As a marginal ward in a marginal seat this one should be watched closely, although given the local factors here and the splits in both main parties you should probably take any vote changes with bucketfuls of the red salt which the local chippies specialise in.  Defending for Labour is Colin McKenzie, a fomer science teacher who now runs a tutoring business in Great Harwood.  The Conservatives have selected Liz McGinley, wife of the ward's independent ex-Conservative councillor Colin McGinley.  Also standing are Richard Oakley for Reform UK and Michael Miller, a former Conservative Hyndburn councillor who lost his seat in Rishton to Labour last May; Miller subsequently quit the Conservative party over Boris Johnson's behaviour, and he is an independent candidate in this by-election.

<h2>Arden</h2>

Warwickshire county council; caused by the death of Conservative councillor John Horner.

<blockquote>
All the world's a stage,
And all the men and women merely Players;
They have their exits and their entrances,
And one man in his time plays many parts...
- William Shakespeare, <em>As You Like It</em>, Act II, Scene VII
</blockquote>

For our first Conservative defence of the week we travel to the Midlands.  The Arden division of Warwickshire county council covers a large swathe of Warwickshire west of Warwick, south of Solihull, east of Redditch and north of Stratford.  In mediaeval times this was part of the Forest of Arden, which might or might not be the same Forest of Arden where local lad William Shakespeare set his perennially-popular play <em>As You Like It</em>.

This area's ten parishes are sparsely populated, and the division's largest urban centre has just 1,583 electors on the roll.  That's Henley-in-Arden, which was an important market town in mediaeval times but was passed by when the Industrial Revolution came.  Tanworth-in-Arden lies at the northern end of the division, close to the West Midlands conurbation; perhaps because of this, TV viewers of a certain age might know it better as Kings Oak in the ITV soap <em>Crossroads</em>.  Tanworth is also known as the final resting place of the motorcycle and Formula 1 racer Mike Hailwood.  Other villages within the division include Claverdon, Earlswood and Wootton Wawen.  The North Warwickshire railway line runs through the division linking the villages to Stratford and Birmingham; Claverdon station, however, is on the line from Stratford to Warwick and Leamington Spa, with some trains continuing to London.

The whole area, particularly the northern end around Tanworth, is part of the Birmingham stockbroker belt and full of well-off Conservative voters.  The current boundaries of Arden division were introduced in 2017 when the Conservatives polled 82% here; that fell to 74% in 2021 against opposition from Labour, the Greens and the Lib Dems.  Stratford-on-Avon council also has a Conservative majority, and that may well continue after a recent attempt to merge with Warwick council fell through; the four wards wholly or partly in this division all had large Conservative majorities in 2019.  As does the local MP: Nadhim Zahawi, the recently-appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer, would appear to have a secure base for his Tory leadership campaign.

Before that we have a by-election to cover following the death of county councillor John Horner, who passed away in May at the age of 70.  Horner had served on the county council since 2013 and was also a former Stratford-on-Avon district councillor.

Defending for the Conservatives is Ian Shenton, who represents part of the division (Wootton Wawen ward) on Stratford-on-Avon council and now has the chance to double up at county level.  He is opposed by Bryn Turner for Labour and Thom Holmes for the Lib Dems.

Parliamentary constituency: Stratford-on-Avon

<h2>Binley and Willenhall</h2>

Coventry council, West Midlands; caused by the death of Labour councillor John Mutton.

Our other Midlands by-election this week isn't that far away from the Forest of Arden but couldn't be more different in character.  We've come to Binley and Willenhall, two strongly working-class areas on the south-eastern edge of Coventry.  Much of the housing here was built by the council, and a third of the housing stock is still socially rented.

The Wikipedia entry for Binley states "It is famous for the Binley Mega Chippy, which is located within Binley."  Your columnist got food from the Binley Mega Chippy before it was famous - there's a hotel behind it which I use on an occasional basis, and the chippy has unusually long opening hours - and the food was decent enough but not particularly memorable.  So quite why this place has become a star of TikTok over the last few weeks is difficult to fathom, but bored people on the internet do what bored people on the internet do and the result is that Kamal Gandhi, the chippy owner who is just as nonplussed about how this all blew up, has had to take on four extra staff members to meet the demand.  And since I've had to hear the Binley Mega Chippy song in researching this piece, you can too; best of luck getting this out of your head.

The Coventry South parliamentary seat turned in a very close result in December 2019, with Labour holding the seat by just 401 votes.  That majority must have come out of Binley and Willenhall ward, which consistently votes Labour in Coventry city council elections although not always safely so: the Conservatives were fairly close to winning in 2004, 2006 and 2019.  In May this year Labour councillor John Mutton was re-elected with 41% of the vote against 29% for the Conservatives and 19% for the localist Coventry Citizens party - this was despite a damaging and long-running strike by the city's bin lorry drivers.

John Mutton was described in the council's obituary as a recognised political heavyweight, who had worked his way up from semi-professional footballer and union shop steward to leader of the council in his native city.  Mutton was first elected for Binley and Willenhall ward in 1984, and served as Lord Mayor of Coventry in 1997-98 and Leader of the Council in 2003-04 and from 2010 to 2013; in between he was leader of the Labour group in opposition.  Mutton passed away in May, aged 74, just ten days after he had been re-elected for another four-year term.  We'll never know what he would have made of the Binley Mega Chippy song.

Defending this by-election for Labour is Seyi Agboola.  The Conservatives have reselected Amarjit Singh Khangura who was runner-up here in 2021 and last May.  Also returning is Paul Cowley for the Coventry Citizens, who has contested this ward every year since 2018 (originally with the UKIP nomination).  The ballot paper is completed by a third returning candidate from May, Marianne Fitzgerald of the Alliance for Democracy and Freedom, and by Michael Morgan for the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition.

<h2>Thetford Boudica</h2>

Breckland council, Norfolk; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Mark Robinson.

We now cross to East Anglia.  Thetford is an old town in the south-west corner of Norfolk, located on the old road from London to Norwich at the point where it crosses the Riber Thet.  This important location at the centre of East Anglia once had a population to match: at the time of the <em>Domesday</em> survey in 1086 Thetford's population was over 4,000 and the town had a bishop, whose see moved to Norwich in the following decade.  Thetford was hit hard by the dissolution of the monasteries in the 1530s and never became a great city: there has been major population growth over the last century, but that was due to London overspill development following the Second World War.

Thetford has some associations with radical politics.  It was the birthplace of Thomas Paine, the American revolutionary, and it was the first town to elect a black mayor: Allan Minns, a medical doctor from the Bahamas, was Mayor of Thetford in 1904-05 and 1905-06.  Even now the town's politics is rather more left-wing than the countryside which surrounds it.  Thetford is, however, outvoted by the countryside parts of the Breckland district and the South West Norfolk parliamentary seat, both of which have large Conservative majorities: Liz Truss, the local MP and Foreign Secretary, would appear to have a secure base for her Tory leadership campaign.

Thetford Boudica ward may have a name commemorating the ancient warrior queen of the Iceni, the Celtic tribe who were based in this corner of East Anglia; but the ward is definitely not old.  This is a residential area in the north-east of the town.  Boudica ward was created for the 2015 Breckland elections out of territory which was previously part of Thetford-Guildhall ward: in the 2011 census that was a working-class area which made the top 100 wards in England and Wales for those employed in manufacturing, and had a large population from the new EU states.

Despite or perhaps because of that, UKIP topped the poll in Thetford Boudica ward in 2015, with the Conservatives' Mark Robinson winning the other seat.  The UKIP councillor didn't seek re-election in 2019 and the two-person Tory slate was opposed only by a single Labour candidate, who picked up the open seat 25 votes ahead of the second Conservative.  Shares of the vote were 54% for the Conservatives and 46% for Labour.  Most of the ward is within the Thetford East division of Norfolk county council, which has returned five different councillors at its last five elections but is currently safely Conservative.

This by-election follows the resignation of Conservative councillor Mark Robinson, who was first elected in 2011 for Thetford-Saxon ward and transferred here in 2015.  Robinson was mayor of Thetford in 2020-21.  He has stood down from both Breckland council and Thetford town council for personal reasons.

The by-election to replace Robinson is another straight fight.  Defending for the Conservatives is Mac Macdonald, who has recently retired from a 39-year career in the Royal Air Force.  Challenging for Labour is Terry Land, a retired journalist.

For our London by-election this week we are in the borough where Normal Rules Did Not Apply.  From 1978 to 2022 Wandsworth was the Tory Flagship borough in London, holding firm for the Conservatives while many similar areas of Inner London fell out of the party's grasp long ago.  An aggressive low-council tax policy was a major part of the Wandsworth Conservatives' appeal, as can be seen by the fact that in 2002 the borough had a full slate of Labour MPs and a 50-10 Conservative lead on the council.

The revolution came and the Wandsworth Conservatives' luck finally ran out this year, with the 2022 borough elections returning 35 Labour councillors, 22 Conservatives and an independent.  The Labour majority includes Tooting Broadway ward which is one of the longest-standing Labour parts of the borough: Tooting, the main predecessor ward, had returned Labour councillors at every election this century.  Tooting Broadway ward is centred on the Underground station of that name, and its largest employer is St George's Hospital.

This column previewed a by-election in Tooting ward in 2016 (<em>Andrew's Previews 2016</em>, page 168), at which I noted that St George's is a teaching hospital, part of the University of London.  As a result, the ward's demographics are skewed by a large number of students living in the area.  Famous students and staff to have come out of St George's include the vaccination pioneer Edward Jenner, the mathematician and Egyptologist Thomas Young, the present Tooting MP Rosina Allin-Khan, and the ITV Chaser Paul Sinha.

Your columnist has known Paul for some years through the quiz circuit.  For the moment, he is not letting his Parkinson's diagnosis stop him competing in that game at the highest level, as those unlucky enough to be playing aginst him soon find out.  At the time of writing Sinha is ranked as the number 1 player in the current season of the Online Quiz League UK, playing on the team called "Quiz Machine Kills Fascists".  Wolfie Smith would approve.

In May the Labour slate in Tooting Broadway ward defeated the Conseravtives by a 61-19 margin.  The elected candidates included Andy Gibbons, a retired teacher who has sat as a member of Wandsworth council for various Tooting wards since 1994.  For many years he was deputy leader of the council's Labour group.  Unfortunately, Gibbons passed away less than three weeks after his final re-election.

Defending for Labour is Rex Osborn, who is a Blue Badge tourist guide.  The Conservative candidate is Jonathan Iliff, a doctor and mental health campaigner who fought Furzedown ward in the borough elections two months ago.  Two more candidates who stood in different Wandsworth wards in May complete the ballot paper, Lisa Osborne for the Green Party and Haren Thillainathan for the Lib Dems.

<h2>Brympton</h2>

South Somerset council; caused by the death of Liberal Democrat councillor Alan Smith.

We finish with what might well be the final by-election to South Somerset council.  Local government reform is in the works, and all the district councils in Somerset will be abolished in April next year as part of a takeover by the county council.

The outgoing district of South Somerset covers pretty much the area you'd expect from that name.  Don't be fooled by the nice rural countryside: this is a major manufacturing centre, with the Augusta Westland helicoptuer factory in Yeovil underpinning the economy.  In the 2011 census nine of the top eleven wards in south-west England for manufacturing were in South Somerset, including Brympton.

Brympton itself has now been swallowed up by the growth of Yeovil, although it has not been formally incorporated into the town and retains its own parish council.  The rapidly-disappearing open space in the ward includes the manor house of Brympton d'Evercy.  Within the ward boundary is the football stadium of Huish Park, home since 1990 to Yeovil Town FC, which hosted league football from 2003 to 2019.  Yeovil had one season in the Championship (2013-14), but have fallen on hard times since then; in May South Somerset council bought Huish Park off the club and immediately leased the stadium back to them.

South Somerset council has been a Lib Dem stronghold since the days when Paddy Ashdown was the local MP.  There is a decent minority Conservative vote in Brympton ward but the Tories' best result here in recent years was winning one of the two seats in 2015.  Boundary changes for the 2019 election left the ward pretty much intact but added a third councillor to reflect population growth; the Liberal Democrats won all three seats in the 2019 election with a 54-37 lead over the Conservatives.

The local government reorganisation in Somerset meant that the 2021 county council elections were postponed to 2022.  The Brympton county council division, which covers a larger area than this ward, had voted Conservative in 2017 but comfortably returned two Liberal Democrats in May; this means that Brympton is part of the Lib Dem majority on the new Somerset county council.  Once the reorganisation completes in April the county council will continue as a unitary council.  So the winner of this by-elcection will not serve for long until their post is abolished in April, and could then have to wait a while for the next Somerset elections in 2027.

Defending for the Liberal Democrats is Barbara Appleby, the clerk of Yeovil Without parish council.  The Conservatives have selected Tony Power, a Brympton parish councillor who was a candidate in the Somerset county elections here two months ago; Power also fought the 2017 Somerset county elections here, on that occasion with the UKIP nomination.  Also standing are Terry Ledlie for Labour, Alan Flint for the Green Party and ex-Lib Dem Yeovil town councillor Ashley Richards as an independent candidate.
