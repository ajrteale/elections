It would be remiss of me to start a piece about Chester without bringing you my photograph of what is reputed to be the second-most photographed clock in England.
Indeed, given that the Elizabeth Tower of the House of Commons has been shrouded in scaffolding for much of the last few years, this particular clock might have been temporarily promoted to number 1.  This is the Eastgate Clock, erected in 1899 to mark (albeit two years late) the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria.

The four faces of the Eastgate Clock sit on top of an arch which carries Chester's city walls over Eastgate Street.  The arch dates from the eighteenth century; the wall here is mediaeval or later and the buildings around it still lie on their mediaeval footprints, but this site is older than it looks.  Eastgate lies on the site of the original east gate of the Roman fortress of <em>Deva Victrix</em>, and Eastgate Street is a Roman road.

<em>Deva</em> was the origin of modern Chester, being founded in the mid-70s as a fortress on the uncertain fringes of the Roman Empire.  The Romans' truce with the Brigantes, whose stronghold was what is now northern England, had broken down, and the emperor Vespasian sent the Legio II <em>Adiultrix</em> to subdue the region.  The legion chose for this task a strategic site on a hill overlooking the River Dee, which at the time was navigable up to a harbour on the Roodee.

Roman forts were built to a standard plan, with an outer wall in the shape of a playing-card and gates in all four walls.  <em>Deva</em> was no exception to this rule, but it was an unusually large fort with its outer wall enclosing 62 acres.  Inside the walls were everything needed for the legion to keep going: barrack-blocks, stores, a large house for the commanding officer and a headquarters building (the <em>principia</em>).

The modern Eastgate Street, Bridge Street and Watergate Street all started off as Roman streets between these buildings; the other thoroughfare feeding into the road junction at Chester Cross, Northgate Street, came later and runs through the site of the <em>principa</em> building.  The west wall of <em>Deva</em> roughly followed the modern Nicholas Street, while the north and east walls now form part of the modern Chester city walls.  Nothing remains of the original southern boundary of the Roman fort except for the foundations of the angle tower at the south-east corner, which can be seen next to Little St John Street.

Opposite the angle tower on the other side of that road can be seen what is left of Chester's Roman amphitheatre.  Originally this would have seated around 7,000 soldiers and other Cestrians to watch all kinds of sport.  Much of the site is buried under later buildings, so the modern retaining wall that runs through the arena has been painted to give visitors an impression of what the place might originally have looked like.

The Roman city of Chester was the fort and the civilian settlement outside it; and in a very literal sense the fort and the city are still the same thing.  The Old English word <em>ceaster</em> is a generic name for any Roman fort, and forms a major element in modern placenames such as Manchester, Doncaster, Leicester and even Wroxeter; but all of those cities have an extra part to their name, something to mark them apart from all the other abandoned forts.  Chester used to have this - the Venerable Bede wrote of "the city of the Legions, which the Angles call Legacæestir, and the Britons also more correctly Carlegion" - but in both the English and Welsh languages the name of the city, "Chester" or "Caer", has lost its disambiguator.  It's simply "the fort".

Even after the Romans quit these shores, Chester remained as a thriving city.  One reason for this was that it was a port; immediately to the west of the city was a harbour now known as the Roodee.  This harbour silted up long ago leaving behind an open field within a bend of the Dee.  Since at least 1539 this has been the site of Chester Racecourse, which is recognised by Guinness as the oldest racecourse still in operation; it's also the shortest racecourse in England with one lap of the course covering 1 mile and 1 furlong.  Spectators who are too stingy to pay the entrance fee can get a great view of the action from the city walls, which overlook the finishing straight.

Two bridges cross the Dee either side of the Roodee, both of which have some significance too.  The Grosvenor Bridge, which carries the main road towards Wrexham, was when it was built in 1832 the largest single-arch stone bridge in the world.  The Dee Bridge, which carries the railway line towards North Wales, collapsed in 1847 - nine months after its opening - while a train was passing over it.  The investigation into that accident found that the bridge's design was flawed, with the collapse caused by the failure of the cast iron used in its construction.  The Dee Bridge was subsequently rebuilt in a stronger material, wrought iron.

The Normans refortified Chester.  Within five years of the 1066 conquest Chester Castle had been erected, and the Earls of Chester quickly established a strong position within Norman England as the most important of the Marcher Lords, protecting the western frontier of England from the Welsh.  Such was their initial success that the <em>Domesday</em> survey covered a large part of what is now Flintshire, reflecting the Earls' holdings.  Cheshire became a county palatine, with the Earl having powers not dissimilar to those of the king.

Indeed, in time the Earldom and the monarchy became one, as every Prince of Wales since the 14th century has held the subsidiary title of Earl of Chester.  One of the first Acts of Charles III following his accession was to create William and Kate as the current Earl and Countess.

Not much of the mediaeval Chester Castle survives; it was comprehensively redeveloped in the late eighteenth century as a series of imposing neoclassical buildings.  The largest of these is Chester Crown Court, which has been the venue for a number of famous trials including that of the Moors Murderers in 1966.

The modern Chester city walls form an almost-complete circuit of two miles around the city, but there is a break in the walls next to the River Dee.  Which brings us to one of Britain's administrative anomalies.  Backing onto the Crown Court and facing the River Dee is the old Cheshire county hall, which was the headquarters of Cheshire county council.  That council was abolished in 2009; its suceessor, Cheshire West and Chester council, then sold the building to the University of Chester which now uses it for teaching in education, health, children's services and social care.

The presence of County Hall in Chester city centre created a problem, because in the Victorian era Chester became a county borough - somewhere where the county council's remit did not run.  The solution to this was one of Britain's most bizarre administrative oddities.  Chester Castle became a civil parish of its own, surrounded by but not part of the county borough, for the sole purpose of allowing the county council to administer its own offices.  The reason for this arrangement disappeared when Chester county borough disappeared almost half a century ago, and the county council itself no longer exists, but nobody ever has seen fit to abolish Chester Castle parish which is still in operation to this day.  The 2001 and 2011 censuses both recorded a population for Chester Castle parish of zero, so if an election is ever needed to the parish this might be a bit of a challenge to organise.

The county borough never included the full extent of Chester's built-up area.  Hoole, a Chester suburb to the north-east of the town along the main road towards Manchester, wasn't incorporated into the city until 1954.  A mile west of the Roodee, the village of Saltney is an integral part of Chester's built-up area but is over the border in Wales.  This caused all sorts of problems when COVID restrictions in Wales and Cheshire were different, notably so for the non-league football club Chester FC, which plays its football in the English league system but whose stadium is in Wales.  In January 2022 the club was threatened with legal action for admitting spectators to the ground; at the time this was legal in England but was a breach of Welsh COVID rules.

In between Saltney and the city centre can be found Curzon and Westminster, which - as one look at the mansions overlooking the Roodee from the far side of the river would suggest - is a high-status area.  The north-western suburb of Blacon is a complete contrast: this is Chester's council-estate ward, and even after a few decades of Right to Buy 39% of Blacon's households were still socially-rented in 2011.  The city's eastern and northern suburbs, Great Boughton, Hoole, Newton and Upton-by-Chester, fall within those two extremes.

Upton-by-Chester is the location of one of the UK's most-visited tourist attractions.  Chester Zoo has been operating on this site since 1931, and welcomed more than 2 million visitors in 2019 alone.  The zoo has done its bit for the current by-election, hosting a candidate hustings earlier this week with a focus on the environment.  Channel 4 have broadcast a documentary series on the zoo's running for over ten years now, and it's not the only Chester-based programme on that channel.  Hollyoaks, the soap opera set in a fictional Chester suburb of that name (although it's actually filmed in Liverpool), is about to broadcast its 6,000th episode.

Among the villages around Chester located within this parliamentary seat, one has a railway connection to the big city.  Capenhurst is a small village with a lot of industry, notably in the form of a factory which enriches uranium for the nuclear power market.  Its station, close to the factory, has half-hourly trains to Chester and to Liverpool as part of the Merseyrail network.

Chester has returned MPs to Parliament since the reign of Henry VIII, who put to an end a system whereby Cheshire went unrepresented because of its status as a county palatine.  For centuries one of the city's two MPs was usually a Grosvenor.  It's difficult to get far in Chester without encountering the name Grosvenor, as the family of that name have been investing in and doing good works in the city for centuries.  The current head of the Grosvenor family, the 7th Duke of Westminster, is one of the richest men in the country as the head of a property empire which includes much of Mayfair.  Anybody who has played Monopoly will know that landing on Mayfair can cost you a small fortune in rent, and the Duke's large fortune shows that that's true in real life too.

The redistribution of 1885 cut Chester's representation from two MPs to one and expanded the franchise, but even then the Duke of Westminster could influence the city's elections through the large number of electors in Chester who were his tenants.  This was blamed for the defeat in 1886 of the city's Liberal MP Walter Foster, a doctor and medical professor.  Foster had been elected for the city in 1885, defeating the Conservative candidate Robert Yerburgh by 300 votes; a year later, with the Liberals split over Irish Home Rule, Yerburgh prevailed by 2,540 votes to 2,483, a majority of 66.

Robert Yerburgh went on to serve as MP for Chester for nearly 30 years.  He was a barrister who was probably in the unusual position for the time of having a wife who was wealthier than he was.  Elma Yerburgh was the daughter of the Blackburn brewer Daniel Thwaites, and she inherited the Thwaites brewery upon her father's death in 1888.

The Liberal landslide of 1906 was just strong enough to unseat Yerburgh, who lost by the narrow margin of 47 votes (3,524 to 3,477).  The Liberal candidate who won Chester that year was Lord Melchett - yes, really.  Alfred Mond, as he was known at this point, was the son of the noted chemist Ludwig Mond.  He went on to become a director of his father's businesses Brunner Mond and Mond Nickel, and ended up as the first chairman of ICI.  Mond combined this with a long political career, which started here in Chester: he went on to serve in the Lloyd George cabinets as First Commissioner of Works and Minister of Health.  He was also a prominent Zionist, and a town in Israel (Tel Mond) is named after him.

Alfred Mond left Chester in January 1910 for a safer seat in Swansea, and to date he was the last Liberal MP for Chester.  The seat reverted to the Conservatives' Robert Yerburgh who won both 1910 elections narrowly (his majorities were 202 votes in January and 106 votes in December).

By now Robert Yerburgh's health was deteriorating, and his heart troubles wouldn't have been helped by an episode in 1914.  When the First World War broke out Robert and Elma were in the German spa town of Bad Nauheim, and they were detained as prisoners of war for several weeks before being allowed to return to England via Switzerland.  Yerburgh resigned from the Commons in early 1916, having been promised a peerage; however, he died before the paperwork to send him to the Lords was ready.

The resulting 1916 Chester by-election was subject to the wartime political truce, which meant that the Conservative candidate was elected unopposed.  In a surprising move the Tory nomination went to Sir Owen Philipps, who had previously been a Liberal MP: he represented the Pembroke and Haverfordwest District of Boroughs from 1906 to December 1910.  Philipps was another prominent businessman who was a major figure in the shipping industry: he controlled the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company, which was on an aggressive growth spurt.  By 1927, when it took over White Star Line, the Royal Mail Steam Packet was the largest shipping group in the world.

Unlike Alfred Mond's business empire, Philipps' turned out to be built on sand.  The Royal Mail line had been loss-making since 1926 and covered this up by opaque accounting while continuing to pay dividends.  By 1929 the reserves were exhausted and the directors were forced to ask for a renegotiation of their government loan repayments; the Treasury ordered an audit of the company's accounts which revealed the truth, and the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company went into liquidation owing £10 million to its creditors.  In an Old Bailey trial in 1931 Lord Kylsant (as Sir Owen Philipps had by now become) was found guilty of falsifying one of the company's trading prospectuses (a conviction which was upheld by the Court of Appeal) and sentenced to twelve months' inmprisonment.  Kylsant's barrister in that trial was the Liberal MP and future party leader Sir John Simon; leading the prosecution case was Sir William Jowitt, who fourteen years later would succeed Simon as Lord Chancellor.

Owen Philipps/Lord Kylsant had stood down as MP for Chester in 1922.  By this point it was a very different constituency to the one he had first been elected for.  Chester had been disenfranchised as a borough by the 1918 redistribution, and was now the centre of a county constituency which included all of what would become the city's suburbs (except Welsh Saltney) and some nearby villages to make up the numbers.  Exactly which villages have been in this constituency has varied over the years, but otherwise the City of Chester constituency (as it was now renamed) is little altered since 1918.

From 1885 to 1918 most of Chester's suburbs and surrounding villages had formed part of the Eddisbury constituency, which covered a large swathe of western Cheshire but no large towns.  With the exception of the 1906 Liberal landslide, this was a Conservative seat throughout this period.  The Tory MPs for the seat were local squire Henry Tollemache (1885-1906) and Harry Barnston (Jan 1910-1918); the Liberal MP from 1906 to 1910 was Arthur Stanley, who would later serve throughout the First World War as governor of the Australian state of Victoria.

In 1922 the expanded Chester constituency was handed over by Sir Owen Philipps to another Conservative with an interest in a shipping line.  Sir Charles Cayzer, 3rd baronet, had rather more success in business than Kylsant as a director of the Clan Line, which by the 1930s was the largest cargo line in the world - this time with sound finances.

Cayzer was only in his mid-twenties when he took over the City of Chester constituency, having survived two years in France during the First World War.  Given the mortality rate among young upper-class officers of his generation during that war, that's quite an achievement.  Sir Charles went on to have a long career as MP for Chester, only being seriously threatened in 1929 when he held off the Liberal candidate Aubrey Herbert by just 162 votes (13,454 to 13,292).

When the Second World War broke out Cayzer rejoined the Army and was commissioned into his old regiment, the 19th Hussars.  On 18th February 1940 he was found dead at his country estate, Kinpurnie Castle in Angus, along with his butler; both of them had gunshot wounds to the head.  It appears that Sir Charles Cayzer shot his butler before taking his own life.

Again, the resulting 1940 City of Chester by-election was uncontested due to the wartime political truce.  The city's new Conservative MP was Basil Nield, a barrister who at the time was in his mid-thirties.  Nield was in the Officers' Emergency Reserve, which meant he was often away on active service during the war years: he was mentioned in despatches while serving as a deputy judge advocate general in the Middle Eastern Force, and was awarded a military MBE.

Nield held his seat easily against the Attlee landslide of 1945, and became a KC the same year.  The highlight of his parliamentary career was introducing the bill which became the Adoption of Children Act 1949, which significantly reformed and liberalised the law relating to adoption.  Nield's legal career also continued to develop, and in 1956 he was appointed a judge and became Recorder of Manchester.  This meant he had to leave the Commons.

This time, the resulting City of Chester by-election of 15th November 1956 was contested.  The Liberals reselected their candidate from the previous year's general election John Seys-Llewellyn, a barrister who had taken part in the Nuremberg Trials.  The Labour candidate was Lewis Carter-Jones, a teacher who would later have a long parliamentary career as MP for Eccles.  Despite getting a 5% swing to Labour, Lewis-Jones wasn't elected here; the City of Chester was a safe Conservative seat at the time which duly elected John Temple.

John Temple spent over 17 years as a backbench Conservative MP, only being seriously threatened in the Wilson landslide of 1966 when his majority fell to 2,803.  In February 1974 he passed the seat on to 29-year-old Peter Morrison.

Nearly all of Morrison's parliamentary career coincided with Margaret Thatcher's leadership of the Conservative Party.  Peter Morrison was a strong supporter of Thatcher, and ran her ill-fated final leadership campaign in 1990; at the time he was the Prime Minister's parliamentary private secretary.

Peter Morrison had spent most of the Thatcher administration in govermment at junior ministerial rank, including a period as deputy chairman of the Conservative Party, but he never made it to Cabinet.  Perhaps there was a reason for this.  During his career rumours had been circulating within the Whips office and within his constituency that Morrison was homosexual and excessively interested in small boys.  Morrison always denied the allegations that were put to him, but the effect was to place a limit on his government career.  At the time his alleged homosexuality was seen as more of a problem by the Whips, because it could lead to his being compromised by Soviet agents.  In the twenty-first century multiple sources have discussed Morrison's paedophilia, and the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse had some harsh words for the way the allegations against him were covered up.  Whatever Morrison actually did or may have done, he'll never answer for it now: he suffered a fatal heart attack in 1995, aged just 51.

Sir Peter Morrison was knighted shortly before he retired from the Commons in 1992, passing the seat on to the new Conservative MP Gyles Brandreth.  Yes, <em>that</em> Gyles Brandreth.  He was elected by just 1,101 votes, the closest result in the City of Chester since 1929; the Labour candidate David Robinson's 42% of the vote was the best Labour performance to date in the seat.  It was a harbinger of things to come.

Ironically for such a natural media whore, when Brandreth got into government in 1996 he was placed in the relative seclusion of the Whips' office.  From the backbenches he had previously piloted through Parliament the Marriage Act 1994, which liberalised the rules on marriage ceremonies by allowing them to be solemnised "on premises approved for the purpose by local authorities", not just in churches or register offices.

Gyles Brandreth was swept away by over 10,000 votes in the Labour landslide of 1997, which in retrospect was a watershed in Chester's politics.  Chester had never voted Labour before 1997; since then it has only failed to vote Labour once.  The new Labour MP for the city was Christine Russell, a Chester city councillor who at the time was working for the mental health charity Mind.

Russell's majority fell to just 917 votes in 2005, and she lost her seat in 2010 when the Labour government fell.  Enjoying a majority of 2,583 was the new Conservative candidate Stephen Mosley, another Chester city councillor who represented Handbridge and St Mary's ward (south of the city centre on the far side of the Dee).  In 2006 Mosley had been good enough to email me with a correction to the Local Elections Archive Project: the city council website had put a typing error in his vote total for 2004 which I had unwittingly copied.  These things happen.

Unexpectedly and against the national trend, Stephen Mosley lost his seat to Labour in 2015, becoming the first Chester MP to serve only one term since the Liberals' Walter Foster in 1885-86.  When the votes came out of the boxes, Mosley had 22,025 but Labour's Chris Matheson had 22,118, giving a Labour majority of just 93 votes.  It was the third-closest result of the 2015 general election.

Chris Matheson subsequently went on to make one of the most marginal of seats into a safe Labour constituency.  He was re-elected for a third term in December 2019 with 50% of the vote against 38% for the Conservatives' Samantha George, a majority of 6,164 votes.

This good recent Labour performance also reflects good recent Labour performances in local elections.  The local authority here is the appallingly-named Cheshire West and Chester council, which combines a lot of very Tory and very affluent countryside with the city of Chester. the industrial towns of Ellesmere Port and Northwich, and the Liverpool overspill town of Winsford.  It's a rather delicate political balance, and the council has been hung since 2015 with a precarious Labour minority administration in place.

Cheshire West and Chester's ward boundaries don't match up with the parliamentary seat, which shouldn't be surprising because the ward boundaries here have changed three times since the seat was last drawn up based on the December 2000 electoral register.  The last local elections here were all the way back in May 2019.  If we take as a best fit for the constituency the eight wards wholly within the seat plus the whole of Christleton and Huntington ward, then aggregating those nine wards together gives vote shares of 39% for Labour, 33% for the Conservatives and 12% for the Liberal Democrats.  The council seats split 12 to Labour and 7 to the Conservatives.

At this point Britain Elects has to declare an interest, because also elected here in 2019 was this column's genial host and Britain Elects founder Ben Walker.  He is not a Cheshire West and Chester councillor, instead sitting on Upton-by-Chester parish council.  Walker has been selected as a Labour candidate for the next Cheshire West and Chester elections in May 2023, when he will contest the city-centre Chester City and the Garden Quarter ward.  (Will this do, Ben?)

Readers who have got this far will have noted that the City of Chester has elected a number of previous MPs who have been the subject of scandal, either during or after their terms of office.  Financial misconduct, alleged paedophilia, even murder, we've had it all.  Well, we can now add to that list the Labour MP Christian Matheson, who has recently been investigated by Parliament's Independent Expert Panel over allegations of sexual misconduct towards a junior staff member.  On 21st October that panel recommended that Matheson be suspended from the Commons for four weeks.  Under recent changes to parliamentary rules prompted by the similar case of the Conservative MP for Delyn Rob Roberts (who remains in post), this would have resulted in Matheson facing a recall petition from his electors.  Although he continued to deny the allegations, Matheson decided to jump before he was pushed and he promptly applied for the Children Hundreds.

So we have a by-election which will be the first of a series of Labour defences in north-west England.  We have further by-elections to come in Stretford and Urmston in two weeks' time, before travelling to West Lancashire in the new year.

Defending this by-election, the first of the Sunak era, is Samantha Dixon.  She is a former leader of Cheshire West and Chester coucnil and currently represents Chester City and the Garden Quarter ward on that council.

The Conservatives have also gone for a Cheshire-based candidate, although not a local one.  Liz Wardlaw is based on the far side of the county in Congleton, where she represents Odd Rode ward on Cheshire East council.  She is a registered nurse.

The only other party to save their deposit here in December 2019 were the Liberal Democrats, who start from 6.8%.  Their candidate is Rob Herd, who is one of two candidates (the other being Dixon) to live in the constituency; Herd is a modern languages teacher and also a parish councillor.

Two other parties stood here last time.  The Greens have selected Paul Bowers, who is currently the only Green member of Cheshire West and Chester council; he represents Helsby ward, which is part of the Weaver Vale constituency.  The Brexit Party are now Reform UK; their candidate is Jeanie Barton, who lives over the Welsh border in Gresford.  Barton was a UKIP candidate in last year's Senedd election, and in the 2022 Welsh local elections she was an independent candidate for Minera ward in Wrexham.

Four other candidates stand.  Cain Griffiths, a student who works part-time in the hospitality industry, is standing for the UK Independence Party.  There is one London-based candidate on the ballot, Richard Hewison of Rejoin EU whose policy platform is left as an exercise for the reader.  Howling Laud Hope is back for his latest by-election as leader of the Official Monster Raving Loony Party.  Completing the ballot paper is Chris Quartermaine of the Freedom Alliance.

There has been no specific polling for this by-election, but given the recent upturn for Labour and collapse for the government in the national polls this should be a far easier Labour defence than Hartlepool, which was also triggered by MP misconduct.  That was only 19 months ago, but it feels like a different era.

The result for this by-election won't come in until very late into the night, so while you're waiting let me bring you the undercard to today's title fight, as we consider five local by-elections.  The Conservatives and Labour are defending two each, with the odd one out being a Green Party defence.  I'll start with one of the Labour defences, in Scotland...
