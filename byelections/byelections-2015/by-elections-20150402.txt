The General Election is imminent: Parliament is dissolved, the televised debates are under way, and for most of the country the political parties have bigger fish to fry this April than local by-elections.  Nonetheless, three contests have been scheduled for April, the first two of which are this week: both slightly unusual in that one is a Wednesday poll, while the other falls on Maundy Thursday - it's only a few years since electoral law prohibited polling on the Thursday before Easter.  The Thursday poll is in Gwynedd and will be covered on Welsh Elections, while on Wednesday a trip to the very southern edge of London awaits us.

As there aren't many by-elections this month, your columnist intends to fill the gap by turning his gaze to the national picture, and putting together a prediction for the general election which you can all laugh at.  Stay tuned.

By-election on 1st April 2015:

WHYTELEAFE, Tandridge council, Surrey; caused by the disqualification of Conservative councillor Tom Dempsey, who failed to attend any meetings of the council in six months.

Nestled in a dry valley in the North Downs, Whyteleafe is named after the aspen trees that used to grow in White Leaf Field here: the olde-worlde spelling is a gimmick seized on by property developers following the coming of the railway in the second half of the nineteenth century.  Development of housing here proved to be so lucrative that there are now three railway stations in the ward on two separate lines (Whyteleafe and Whyteleafe South on the Caterham branch, and Upper Warlingham on the Oxted branch).  Despite the presence of Upper Warlingham in Travelcard Zone 6, Whyteleafe lies just outside the Greater London boundary; another slightly unexpected feature of the village is that the main employer here is the head office of Ann Summers.  Ahem.

Over the last five years the ward's political representation has turned fifty shades of blue, as the Conservatives gained what was before May 2010 a safe Lib Dem ward - the May 2010 Tory gain came just three months after the Lib Dems had easily held the ward in a by-election.  At the most recent election the Tories (43%) made the ward safe, with the Lib Dem vote falling away to 27% and UKIP polling 20%.  The Tories also hold the local county council seat (Caterham Valley) which at the most recent county election in 2013 had very similar shares of the vote.

Defending for the Conservatives is Peter Sweeney.  He is opposed by David Lee, the winner of the February 2010 by-election, who lost his seat to the Tories in 2012 and has been trying to get it back ever since.  UKIP have selected Martin Ferguson, a bus driver.  Labour aren't bothering this time, so these are your three candidates.

By-election on 2nd April 2015:

CADNANT, Gwynedd county council; caused by the death of Plaid Cymru councillor Huw Edwards.  A Gwynedd councillor since 2005 and chairman of the council in 2013, Edwards served three times as Mayor of Caernarfon and spent over 30 years in the Caernarfon Male Voice Chior.

This division covers the bits of Caernarfon the tourists don't normally see: it's a residential area in the east of the town, between the Bethel Road and the Llanberis Road, together with a small part of the town centre.  Caernarfon is a bastion of the Welsh language, and the 2011 census found that 86% of the population of Cadnant division were Welsh speakers - one of the highest figures in the whole of Wales.  Other parts of the census figures for the division paint a working-class picture, with relatively high levels of social renting and long-term sickness.

Edwards had been the councillor here since winning a by-election just before Christmas 2005: he had also stood in the 2004 ordinary election as an independent, finishing second.  At his final re-election in 2012 Edwards won 60-40 in a straight fight with Labour.

Defending for Plaid Cymru is Glyn Tomos, who works for the Welsh-language local newspaper Papur Dre.  He is not to be confused with Glyn Thomas, the Labour candidate who fought the division in 2012 and represents the division on Caernarfon town council.  Maria Sarnacki, who finished second to Plaid in a town council by-election here last year, is standing as an independent candidate; Jason Parry, a barber, represents the anti-Plaid regionalist party Llais Gwynedd; and the ballot paper is completed by the Conservatives' David Hibbert, who gives an address in Bangor and is presumably therefore a paper candidate.

The anti-Plaid regionalist party Llais Gwynedd have nominated Jason Pa
