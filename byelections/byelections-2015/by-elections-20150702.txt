One by-election on Tuesday 30th June:

PENTYRCH, Cardiff city council; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Craig Williams, who is now MP for Cardiff North.  He had served on Cardiff city council since winning a 2008 by-election.

This division is a rural area, covering the villages of Pentyrch and Gwaelod-y-Garth and part of Taff's Well to the north-west of Cardiff.  The division lies on the slopes of Garth Hill, thought to the inspiration for the book "The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain", which gives good views of the city of Cardiff and the Bristol Channel.  Taff's Well is named after a hot spring, the only spa in Wales, but its traditional industry was ironworking.  Pentyrch division was annexed by Cardiff in 1996 and, according to the 2011 census, has Cardiff's largest proportion of Welsh speakers.

In 2004 Pentyrch was a three-way marginal, with Labour topping the poll on 35%, four points ahead of the Conservatives who were themselves five points ahead of Plaid.  The Conservatives gained the division from Labour in 2008 with a majority of 49 votes, but their new councillor Simon Roberts had to resign almost immediately on health grounds.  Craig Williams held the by-election in July 2008 with a majority of 12 votes, and made his seat safe in 2012 with a 54%-29% win over Labour, the Plaid score dropping to 12%.

The defending Conservative candidate is Gavin Hill John, who is campaigning against the planned reopening of Creigiau quarry nearby.  Labour have selected Paul Fisher, a barrister.  Plaid's candidate is local businessman Hywel Wigley, Ruth Osner stands for the Greens, Cadan ap Tomos for the Lib Dems and Munawar Mughal is an independent candidate.

Two by-elections on Thursday 2nd July:

HAMPTON WICK, Richmond upon Thames London borough council; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Tania Mathias, who defeated the Business secretary Vince Cable in May to become MP for Twickenham.  She had served as a Richmond councillor since 2010.

This ward is on the Middlesex side of Richmond borough, directly opposite Kingston upon Thames and running north-west along the Kingston Road and Broom Road from Kingston Bridge and Hampton Wick railway station (on the Kingston Loop line from Waterloo).  It is probably still best known as the location for the 1970s ITV sitcom George and Mildred.

Although Richmond council is closely fought between the Tories and Lib Dems, this is a safe Tory ward.  In 2014 the Tory slate had 50%, with the Lib Dem slate narrowly falling into third place behind the single Green candidate; both those parties polled 18%.  At the top of the Tory slate with a clear personal vote is Tony Arbour, who has been a Richmond councillor since 1968 and represents the borough on the London Assembly.  At the most elections to that Assembly, in 2012, Boris beat Ken 61-20 here in the Mayoral ballot, while the Tories topped the list ballot with 45% to 19% for Labour, 16% for the Lib Dems and 12% for the Greens.

Defending for the Conservatives is Jon Hollis, chairman of the Twickenham Conservative association, who describes himself on Twitter as "husband to a wife, father to a son, slave to 3 cats".  He lost his council seat in his home Teddington ward last year.  Standing for the Greens is construction entrepreneur Anthony Breslin, who appears to be the only candidate to live in the ward.  The Lib Dems have selected school governor Geraldine Locke, who only joined the party last month.  Also standing are Dr Paul Tanto for Labour, independent candidate Michael Lloyd and the ward's first UKIP candidate, Sam Naz.

GRANTHAM BARROWBY, Lincolnshire county council; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Jo Churchill, who is now the MP for Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk.

This county division combines the south-west corner of the town of Grantham with the village of Barrowby just to the west.  The Grantham half of the division, based on the old Earlesfield district ward (the district wards were redrawn this year, but the county divisions here haven't yet caught up) has some light industry and distribution, notably the book distribution company Grantham Book Services.

The division was narrowly won by Labour at the 2005 election, but they fell to a poor third place in 2009 with the Tories gaining.  Jo Churchill was first elected here in 2013 in a three-way marginal result, polling 38% to 32% for an independent candidate and 30% for Labour.  District council results make it clear that the Labour vote comes out of the town rather than Barrowby, but in May's district council election the redrawn Grantham Earlesfield ward saw the Labour slate lose a seat to the single UKIP candidate, who was not opposed by the Tories and topped the poll.

Mark Whittington defends for the Tories: he is a self-employed accountant and Barrowby parish councillor.  The independent candidate from 2013, Mike Williams, tries again as candidate of the Lincolnshire Independents, a well-organised county council group.  Labour have selected Rob Shorrock, who lost his district council seat in Grantham Earlesfield in May.  Also on the ballot is UKIP's Maureen Simon.
