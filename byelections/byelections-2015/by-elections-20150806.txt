It's a Scottish by-election special this week with no fewer than five local by-elections, four of which are in Glasgow.

ANDERSTON/CITY, Glasgow city council; caused by the resignation of SNP councillor Martin Docherty who is now the Member of Parliament for West Dunbartonshire.

Let's start at the most obvious point: the centre.  Anderson/City is Glasgow's central ward, covering the whole of the city centre on the north bank of the Clyde, together with the Anderston, Finnieston, Kelvingrove and Yorkhill districts to the west of the centre.  Anderston, an independent burgh until it was annexed by Glasgow in 1846, was comprehensively redeveloped in the 1960s thanks to slum clearance and the building of the M8 motorway and Kingston Bridge through the area, a redevelopment which saw the population fall by over 20,000 in twenty years.  Further out of the centre, Finnieston is a former industrial/dockland area now redeveloped into a major leisure and office centre: among other things the SECC, Scotland's largest exhibition centre and a venue for several events in last year's Commonwealth Games, is here.  Away from the riverside is Kelvingrove, part of Glasgow's bohemian West End and home to the Kelvin Hall and the Kelvingrove Art Gallery, the most-visited museum in the UK outside London.

While the west end may have a bohemian reputation, something which is reflected in a sizeable Green vote, the ward's political character is determined by the tower blocks in Anderston.  In those long-ago days of 2012, the last Glasgow council election, this ward was solidly Labour.  The main surprise came on the SNP side, where the SNP councillor Craig Mackay lost his seat to his running-mate Martin Docherty.  The Green Party councillor Nina Baker was re-elected to the final seat with the help of transfers from Labour and minor parties, defeating Mackay in the final round fairly comfortably.  On first preferences Labour led the SNP 50-30, so the SNP would need a 20-point swing to win in the first round.  Eminently possible, considering the very changed political landscape in Glasgow since 2012; and that the third party in the ward, with just over 10% in 2012, is the pro-independence Scottish Greens.

Defending for the SNP is Eva Bolander, a Swedish-born web designer.  No stranger to marathon struggles is the Labour candidate Katie Ford, whose Twitter describes her as an ultra-marathon cyclist and epilepsy campaigner.  Also standing are Christy Mearns for the Green Party, Ary Jaff for the Conservatives, Gary McLelland for the Lib Dems, Stevie Creighton for the Libertarian Party and Janice MacKay (who gives an address in rural Lanarkshire) for UKIP.

CALTON, Glasgow city council; caused by the resignation of SNP councillor Alison Thewliss who is now the Member of Parliament for Glasgow Central.

If Anderson/City was the west end of Glasgow, this is the East End.  Here can be found the city's oldest park, Glasgow Green; the Barrowland Ballroom and Market; and Celtic Park, the home of Celtic FC.  With the presence of Celtic Park and the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome, sport is now a major feature of the ward; however, this is an ex-industrial area and ranks very highly on the indices of multiple deprivation.

Obviously this was a strongly Labour ward in 2012, with Labour leading the SNP 55-30 and winning two seats to the SNP's one, Thewliss defeating her running-mate Alexander Belic in the final round by a rather narrow 106 votes.  Although a large number of parties stood in 2012 the Greens were best of the rest on just 3%, and not a lot of votes split for the last-placed Britannica, a far-right party who polled just nine first preferences.  Not much better was independent candidate Thomas Rannachan, who was second-last with 41 votes on a ticket of opposing Scottish legislation on offensive behaviour at football matches, and didn't do much better in a by-election in Govan ward the following year: confusingly given that electoral pedigree, he is the Labour candidate for this by-election.

Defending for the SNP is Greg Hepburn, formerly communications director for Young Scots for Independence.  Thomas Rannachan, as stated, stands for Labour.  Also on the ballot are Malachy Clarke for the Greens, Thomas Kerr for the Tories, independent candidate Tommy Ramsay, Chris Young of the Liberal Democrats and Karen King for UKIP.

CRAIGTON, Glasgow city council; caused by the resignation of SNP councillor Iris Gibson on health grounds.  Gibson was one of the longest serving SNP councillors in Glasgow, having been first elected in 1999 in the years before PR was introduced; she is the mother of SNP MSP Kenneth Gibson, who is convenor of the Scottish Parliament's finance committee.

South of the Clyde now, and we move to an outer residential area on the Paisley Road.  The Craigton ward is based on the areas of Mosspark, Hillington and North and South Cardonald, former villages which boomed in the inter-war years thanks to its good rail and tram links to Glasgow and the opening of a large industrial estate centred on a factory which made engines for Rolls-Royce.  In 1950 Cardonald saw the building of Moss Heights, the first of Glasgow's many tower blocks of high-rise flats.  With over 24,000 electors, Craigton is one of the largest wards in Scotland.

The raw voting figures from 2012 mask the fact that this is in fact one of Glasgow's more pluralistic areas, with Labour having won only two of the predecessor wards at the last FPTP election in 2003: they were Cardonald and North Cardonald, with Mosspark being SNP as stated above and the former Pollok ward, part of which is here, being one of only a handful of wards in Scotland to elect a councillor for Tommy Sheridan's Scottish Socialist Party.  Support for Sheridan also had an effect in the 2007 election in which Labour tried for three seats: Labour failed to balance their candidates and the Solidarity candidate, Ruth Black, got transfers from the Scottish Socialist Party to defeat the third Labour candidate by 148 votes.  Labour played it safe in the 2012 election with only two candidates, resulting in the SNP easily gaining the Solidarity seat: the first preferences were 53-31 to Labour.

Defending for the SNP is Alex Wilson, who is opposed by Labour's Kevin O'Donnell.  Solidarity having thrown in the towel, the ballot paper is completed by Phillip Charles for the Tories, Katie Noble of the Green Party, UKIP's Arthur Thackeray and the Lib Dems' Isabel Nelson.

LANGSIDE, Glasgow city council; caused by the resignation of Green Party councillor Liam Hainey due to health and family circumstances.

We end our tour of Glasgow in the south of the city.  Langside itself is at the western end of the ward that bears its name, with King's Park at the eastern end and Mount Florida in the middle.  At the ward's geographic centre is Hampden Park, home of the Scotland national football team and venue for the athletics events in the Commonwealth Games last year.  This is one of Glasgow's most desirable wards and very middle class; it once formed the core of the Glasgow Cathcart parliamentary constituency which for many years was a safe Conservative area.

The original Battle of Langside was fought in 1568 and resulted in defeat for Mary, Queen of Scots, who was then exiled to England.  Modern battles are, of course, fought over votes.  In 2007 the ward elected one councillor each from the SNP, Labour and the Lib Dems, who got strong transfers from the Conservatives after the Tory candidate (who had started fourth in the count) was overtaken by the Greens on transfers from Solidarity.  The 2012 result is muddied by a cockup at the count which led to the result being declared without one of the ballot boxes being included, although this did not in the end change the winning candidates.  The SNP topped the poll on first preferences but failed to balance their candidates, and their second candidate was overtaken by the Green Party's Liam Hainey who got transfers from the defeated Lib Dem councillor.

With the Greens only polling 9% here in 2012 there is little chance of them holding their seat.  Instead it'll be a battle between the SNP and Labour, and as stated the SNP were already ahead here in 2012, by 38% to 36%.  

Defending for the Green Party is Robert Pollock.  The SNP candidate is Anna Richardson, an antenatal teacher.  Labour have selected Unison officer Eileen Dinning.  Also on the ballot paper are Kyle Thornton for the Tories, Will Millinship for the Lib Dems, Ian Leech for the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition and Cailean Mongan of UKIP.

HAMILTON SOUTH, South Lanarkshire council; caused by the resignation of SNP councillor Angela Crawley, who is now the Member of Parliament for Lanark and Hamilton East.

Southern Hamilton here, running from the edge of the town centre along the road to Strathaven to the edge of the built-up area.  This is a strong Labour area and before the introduction of PR Labour held all four of the predecessor wards, although in the 2003 election they only just beat Lawson in Silvertonhill ward (covering the Silvertonhill, Low Waters and Eddlewood areas above Eddlewood Glen, connected by Silvertonhill Avenue).  In the two elections since proportional representation was introduced Labour have had the votes to elect three out of the four councillors but never stood more than two candidates; this has resulted in the Tories winning a surprise seat at the 2007 election with just 11% of the vote, and the SNP winning a second seat at the 2012 election to split the ward's representation 2/2.  The ward's other SNP councillor died in 2013 and the SNP lost the by-election to Labour by 52% to 33% - exactly the same scores as in 2012 - so Labour have a chance here to hold all four seats in the ward.

Defending for the SNP is John Ross, a former Hamilton district councillor who has recently retired from running a newsagents.  Labour's candidate is Jim Lee, secretary of the Scottish Co-operative Party.  Also on the ballot paper are Lynne Nailon for the Conservatives (who fought the 2013 by-election), Craig Smith for the Christian Party (fighting the ward for the third time), Donald Mackay for UKIP (who appears to be the husband of their candidate in the Glasgow Anderston/City by-election), Matthew Cockburn of the Lib Dems, Jane Kane for the Green Party and Andrew McCallum for the Pirate Party.
