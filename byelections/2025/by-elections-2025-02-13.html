Six by-elections on 13th February 2025, and lovers of the Oxford comma should look away now:
</p><p>
<h2>Kirkintilloch East and North and Twechar</h2>
</p><p>
East Dunbartonshire council, Scotland; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Susan Murray.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/e-duns-kirkintilloch-e-n-twechar-2025.png" alt="E Duns, Kirkintilloch E/N/Twechar" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
We'll start this week north of the Border within the Central Belt of Scotland.  Here we find the town of Kirkintilloch, which lies around eight miles morth-east of Glasgow.  This was originally a Roman settlement on the Antonine Wall, which passes through this ward from west to east: there were forts at Kirkintilloch, Auchendavy and at Bar Hill to the east of Twechar, where remains of the wall and fort can be seen.  Very little remains of Kirkintolloch's fort, which was located in the modern Peel Park.
</p><p>
Modern Kirkintilloch is a creation of the Industrial Revolution, spurred by the opening of the Forth and Clyde Canal through the town in 1773.  The town was a centre for textiles, ironmaking and even shipbuilding, despite its long distance from the coast.  For many years the Lion Foundry at Kirkintilloch had the contract to make the UK's iconic red telephone boxes, and there is a plan to bring tourists to the town by erecting a giant telephone box here as a public artwork.  The ward name also referes to Twechar, which is a much smaller village located on the canal a few miles east of Kirkintilloch.
</p><p>
Kirkintilloch has seen strong population growth over the last 80 years thanks to Glasgow overspill, although not to the same extent as the New Town of Cumbernauld to the east.  Until 1975 those two towns formed a detached part of Dunbartonshire, cut off from the rest of the county to the west by the Lanarkshire town of Bishopbriggs and the small Stirlingshire villages of the Campsie fells.  These areas were merged in 1975 into the Strathkelvin local governemnt district, most of which subsequently merged with Bearsden and Milngavie in 1996 to create the present East Dunbartonshire council.
</p><p>
East Dunbartonshire council is administered from Kirkintilloch in a building named after the former Labour MP Tom Johnston, who was born in Kirkintilloch and represented West Stirlingshire on and off from 1922 to 1945.  Johnston was briefly Lord Privy Seal in the second Macdonald government, before serving for four years as Scottish secretary in the wartime coalition government.
</p><p>
The 1983 redistribution made Kirkintilloch the centre of a constituency called Strathkelvin and Bearsden, with similar boundaries to the modern East Dunbartonshire district.  This seat still exists for Scottish Parliament elections, although it has had a very high turnover of MSPs: this includes a win in 2003 for independent candidate Jean Turner, who had also come second in a 2001 Holyrood by-election on a ticket of saving services at Stobhill Hospital.  Turner lost her seat to Labour in 2007; Labour subsequently lost the seat to the SNP in 2011.  In 2021 the SNP's Rona Mackay became the first MSP for Strathkelvin and Bearsden to win re-election for a second term.
</p><p>
For some reason, the Scottish Boundary Commission have a blind spot when it comes to drwaing Westminster boundaries in the Kirkintilloch area, and their last two redistributions have left the town divided between two constituencies.  In 2005 the town was split between a seat called "Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East" which set a new record for the number of letters in a constituency name, and a western seat which would have had an equally unweildy name had the public consultation not decided that "East Dunbartonshire" might be less of a mouthful.
</p><p>
The East Dunbartonshire seat combined some of the best Liberal Democrat areas in the Central Belt, and it was won at its first election by 25-year-old Lib Dem candidate Jo Swinson who became the Baby of the House.  Swinson lost her seat to the Scottish National Party in their 2015 landslide, got it back in 2017, became leader of the Lib Dems in the summer of 2019, and then lost her seat to the SNP again in December 2019.  The Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East seat had a much more conventional Central Belt voting history, voting Labour up to 2010 and then SNP from 2015.
</p><p>
The 2024 Westminster redistribution left the constituency boundary through Kirkintilloch more or less as it was, but inexplicably changed the names of the seats on either side of it: "East Dunbartonshire" changed to "Mid Dunbartonshire" for no particularly good reason, while "Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East" was simplified to "Cumbernauld and Kirkintilloch" despite the fact that it does not contain the whole of Kirkintilloch.  (It also still contains Kilsyth.)  Both seats reverted to their 2010 alignment as a result of the SNP collapse.  Most of Kirkintilloch East and North and Twechar ward is part of the Cumbernauld and Kirkintilloch constituency where Labour candidate Katrina Murray narrowly defeated the SNP MP Stuart McDonald; while the western end of this ward, including Kirkintilloch town centre, is part of the Mid Dunbartonshire seat where Lib Dem councillor Susan Murray soundly defeated the SNP MP Amy Callaghan.  Susan Murray is the last of the large intake of new Scottish MPs from 2024 to resign their previous council seat, so this by-election marks the end of a series.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2022/e-duns22s.svgz" alt="E Duns, 2022" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Quite where the Lib Dem Westminster vote in Mid Dunbartonshire comes from is rather difficult to discern from local election results.  In the 2022 East Dunbartonshire elections the Scottish National Party carried every ward in the council area except Bearsden North (which had a strong independent vote), and the SNP are the largest party on the council with 8 seats against 6 Lib Dems, 4 Labour, 3 Conservatives and an independent.  An SNP minority administration is running the show.  This the first by-election in East Dunbartonshire since 2012, so the council must be doing something right.
</p><p>
The theme of long and unweildy names here for electoral units continues at council level with "Kirkintilloch East and West and Twechar", which is 35 letters long but amazingly is only in a tie for the longest ward name we will see this week.  Kirkintilloch East and West and Twechar ward was created in 2017, and its two elections to date have both returned one councillor each from the SNP, Labour and the Lib Dems, the Lib Dem being Susan Murray on both occasions.  First preference shares in 2022 were 38% for the SNP, 30% for Labour and 19% for the Lib Dems; Lib Dem transfers mean that a single-seat count here would have gone to Labour over the SNP by 52-48.
</p><p>
So the Lib Dems have it all to do to hold this seat.  Their defending candidate Marthos Christoforou has the advantage of being top of the ballot paper.  Intending SNP and Labour voters should check carefully which Marshall they are putting their first preference for, as the SNP have selected Serina Marshall while Aidan Marshall is the Labour candidate.  Also standing are Satbir Kaur Gill for the Conservatives, Alan McManus who was the Freedom Alliance candidate here in 2022 and is now standing for "Sovereignty", Eamonn Gallagher for Alba, Bruce Hampton for Reform UK and Elizabeth Rowan for the Greens.

<h2>Warwick All Saints and Woodloes</h2>
</p><p>
Warwick council; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor John Sullivan.
</p><p>
There are quite a lot of repeats this week, because three of the six English wards up for election today have been covered before by Andrew's Previews either in whole or in part.  This sort of thing happens when you've been writing this stuff for nearly two decades.
</p><p>
Our first repeat is a ward which featured in this column just thirteen months ago.  We return to the town of Warwick, which still gives its name to an English county in the Midlands but has been overtaken in size by several other towns within Warwickshire.  Rugby, Nuneaton and Leamington Spa all have larger populations, to say nothing of Birmingham and Coventry.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/warwick-all-ss-woodloes.png" alt="Warwick, Warwick All SS/Woodloes" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Modern Warwick is a rather prosperous town, with good road links to the major conurbations of the West
Midlands supplemented by lots of high-end employment.  For example, All Saints and Woodloes ward is largely a residential area covering Warwick town north of the Grand Union Canal, but it also includes a large office and IT complex run by IBM.
</p><p>
Warwick effectively forms a single urban area with the neighbouring town of Leamington Spa, which it's fair to say is more politically left-wing - partly because Leamington Spa has a lot of Warwick University students.  The Warwick and Leamington parliamentary seat, which is tightly drawn around the urban area, was gained by Labour in 2017: its MP Matt Western was re-elected for a third term in 2024 with a majority increased from 789 votes to over 12,000.
</p><p>
We can see some of this leftward swing from looking at the electoral history of Warwick All Saints and Woodloes ward, which was drawn up for the 2019 Warwick election: however, the ward has the same boundaries as the Warwick North division of the county council, so we can compare county and district results directly.  The area voted Conservative narrowly in the 2017 county and 2019 district elections, but was gained by Labour in 2021 (which was a good Conservative year generally) and in 2023 (which wasn't).  The Conservatives collapsed across the district in the 2023 Warwick council elections and now only hold five out of 44 seats; the Greens are the largest party on 15 having recently picked up a defector from the Conservatives, Labour have 10 plus this vacancy, the Lib Dems are on 10 and the other three seats are held by the Whitnash Residents Association.  A coalition of Green and Labour councillors is running the show.
</p><p>
As stated Warwick All Saints and Woodloes was gained by Labour in 2023, with vote shares being 44% for the Labour slate, 34% for the Conservatives and 13% for the Greens.  Labour councillor Raj Kang resigned within the year for personal reasons, and thankfully the by-election did not replace Kang with Kodos; instead Labour candidate Claire Wightman held the resulting by-election in January 2024 with a 52-38 lead over the Conservatives.  On that occasion the Greens did not stand.
</p><p>
Just thirteen months later we are back in Warwick All Saints and Woodloes to replace John Sullivan, who had left the Labour group in April 2024 to sit as an independent before quitting the council altogether in December.  Given the change of government and political fortunes over the last year this will be a more difficult Labour defence for Cora-Laine Moynihan, who already represents this ward on Warwick town council and now has the chance to double up at district level: she works for a charity which helps victims of sexual abuse.  She will not be helped by having "(address in Solihull)" next to her name on the ballot paper.  The Conservatives have again selected Jody Tracey, who lost his seat in this ward in 2023 and failed to get it back in last year's by-election.  The other losing candidate from January 2024, the Lib Dems' Laurence Byrne, is also back for another go, and he is joined on the ballot paper by Nigel Clarke for Reform UK and Sam Jones for the Greens.

<h2>Manor</h2>
</p><p>
Stevenage council, Hertfordshire; caused by the death of Liberal Democrat councillor Graham Snell.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/stevenage-manor.png" alt="Stevenage, Manor" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
We now travel to one of those wards whose names are so generic that they tell you very little about where they are.  This Manor ward is on the eastern edge of Stevenage, and its name refers to Chells Manor - a 14th-century manor house which long predates the housing around it.  This is a more modern part of Stevenage New Town, which was mostly develpoed in the 1980s and 1990s: in fact, some of the new housing ended up overspilling the New Town limits, and the boundary between Stevenage and East Hertfordshire districts had to be adjusted in 2013 to reflect this.
</p><p>
In the 2021 census Manor ward had by far the highest owner-occupation rate in Stevenage, at 76.9%, and its demographic was rather more middle-class than the town as a whole.  Ward boundary changes in 2024 will probably not have changed that.
</p><p>
Stevenage council has been under Labour control since its creation.  It's not large enough to be a constituency of its own, and the Stevenage parliamentary seat has been a bellwether since its creation in 1983 because it includes more politically right-wing areas outside the town itself, such as Knebworth.  The MP here since 2024 has been Labour's Kevin Bonavia, a lawyer who was born in Malta and had previously served on Lewisham council in London.
</p><p>
Manor ward has consistently voted Liberal Dmoecrat since its creation in 1999.  Until his sudden death last November Graham Snell had represented the ward throughout that period: he was first elected in 1998 for the former Mobbesbury ward.  Snell was most recently re-elected at the whole council election in 2024, at which the Liberal Democrat slate enjoyed a 56-20 lead over Labour.  His successor will be due for re-election in 2026, if municipal government here lasts that long.  The ward is part of the Chells division of Hertfordshire county council, which is also safely Lib Dem.
</p><p>
Defending this seat for the Lib Dems is Peter Wilkins, who has a background in social housing and is a building surveyor; in 2024 he stood in Bandley Hill and Poplars ward.  Labour have selected Thea Pendlebury, who contested the neighbouring Chells ward last year.  Also on the ballot are Marcel Houps for the Conservatives, Stephani Mok for the Greens and Matthew Hurst for Reform UK.

<h2>Burnt Oak</h2>
</p><p>
Barnet council, London; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Ammar Naqvi.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/barnet-burnt-oak.png" alt="Barnet, Burnt Oak" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
For our London by-election this week we are in the outer reaches of the capital.  Burnt Oak is the last stop before Edgware on one of the northern branches of the Northern line, and its Underground station opened in 1924.  This sparked a building boom in the area, led by the London County Council which quickly filled the area to the north of the A5 with the Watling estate, a cottage estate of over 4,000 homes fit for heroes.  The Watling estate has had one long-lasting legacy: the very first Tesco store was opened here at 54 Watling Avenue by Jack Cohen in September 1931.
</p><p>
The original residents of the Watling estate were working-class people rehoused from inner-city districts such as Islington and St Pancras, leading to the area quickly being nicknamed "Little Moscow" by people from nearby Edgware.  In more recent years this has been replaced in the local public consciousness by "Little Romania" or "Little Bucharest" due to Burnt Oak's large Eastern European community, and the census return bears this out: in 2021 Burnt Oak made the top 20 wards in England and Wales for residents born in Bulgaria or Romania, at 9.9%.  It is also in the top 100 wards for Buddhism (2.0%) and for those working in the construction industry (14.9%).
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2022/barnet22s.svgz" alt="Barnet, 2022" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
In local elections Burnt Oak remains a seriously left-wing area, and in 2022 the Labour slate enjoyed a 63-24 lead over the Conservatives here.  That makes the ward rather more left-wing than either Barnet council as a whole (which returned a Labour majority in 2022 for the first time) or the Hendon constituency which Burnt Oak is part of.  Hendon turned in the closest result of the 2024 general election, with Labour MP David Pinto-Duschinsky gaining the seat from the Conservatives by just 15 votes.  So, while Burnt Oak is not a marginal ward the result here should be worth watching.
</p><p>
This by-election has come out of the Councillors Behaving Badly file and is to replace Labour councillor Ammar Naqvi, who tendered his resignation from the council last month.  This came after Naqvi had been sacked as the council's cabinet member for finance, following revelations by the <em>Barnet Post</em> that he had falsely claimed to have worked as an associate professor at UCL Medical School.  Naqvi had represented Burnt Oak ward since 2014.
</p><p>
Defending this seat for Labour is Charlotte Daus, who describes herself on LinkedIn as a regional officer at the Royal College of Nursing; she chairs the New Colindale residents association.  The Conservative candidate is Kevin Ghateh.  Also standing are Gabrielle Bailey for the Greens, Altan Akbiyik for the Lib Dems, Charles Honderick for Rejoin EU (whose signature policy is left as an exercise for the reader) and Sury Khatri for Reform UK.

<h2>Bransgore, Burley, Sopley and Ringwood East</h2>
</p><p>
New Forest council, Hampshire; caused by the resignation of Green Party councillor Neil Millington.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/burley-signpost.jpg" alt="Signpost, Burley, Hants" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
We now travel from one Burnt Oak to a Forest.  Although the New Forest isn't all trees: the word "Forest" in this name is used in its mediaeval sense of royal hunting territory, which encompassed both woodland and heathland.  It's in this heathland that we can find the village of Burley, located to the east of Ringwood around 13 miles north-east of Bournemouth.
</p><p>
Just outside the National Park boundary is Bransgore, whose eponymous parish includes a number of villages just outside Christchurch: Neacroft, Waterditch and Hinton are all part of this ward.  Christchurch used to be part of Hampshire, but it was transferred to Dorset in the 1974 reorganisation.  As part of that reorganisation the new Hampshire-Dorset boundary was drawn through the middle of what was then Christchurch East parish, and Bransgore parish is the part of that area which remained in Hampshire.  The ward includes Hinton Admiral railway station on the northern edge of Christchurch's built-up area; not far from the station is the Office Field Solar Farm, which has been generating electricity for the National Grid (particularly in sunnier months than February) since 2013.
</p><p>
To the west of Bransgore is the village of Sopley, which lies on the Hampshire Avon a few miles north of Christchurch.  This was the home of a Second World War radar station and associated RAF camp which was used in the 1970s to house Vietnamese boat people; Sopley is also the location of Moorlands College, which is a seminary for evangelical Christians.  Finally, the Ringwood East part of the ward name is a reference to the eastern ward of the parish of Ringwood, which covers the area of Ringwood parish within the National Park boundary and doesn't actually contain anything of the town itself: the main population centre here is the small village of Crow.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/new-forest-bransgore-burley-sopley-ringwood-e-2025.png" alt="New Forest, Bransgore/Burley/Sopley/Ringwood E" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
The 35 letters of "Bransgore, Burley, Sopley and Ringwood East" introduce one of the few genuinely rural wards in the New Forest district.  This is because the New Forest district is generally not as rural as it might at first sound.  In fact the New Forest is England's second-largest second-tier district by population, after East Suffolk, and most of its residents live outside the national park in towns such as Ringwood in the Avon valley, Lymington, New Milton and other retirement towns on the coastal strip, the Southampton suburb of Totton and a very industrial area on the west bank of Southampton Water.
</p><p>
This ward was created in 2023 as a straight merger of the former Bransgore and Burley ward with the former Ringwood East and Sopley ward, with a reduction in the overall number of councillors from three to two but no cut to the number of elements in the ward name.  Bransgore and Burley ward was featured in this column in December 2021 (<em>Andrew's Previews 2021</em>, page 598) as part of the fallout from a scandal involving the long-serving former Conservative leader of New Forest council Barry Rickman, who was prosecuted by the Environment Agency in 2021 for running a scrapyard without the necessary environmental permits and fined £1,000.  Rickman was subsequently kicked out of the Conservative group, and the new council leader then proposed to remove him as one of the council's representatives on the New Forest Natioanl Park Authority: that proposal led to the resignation of Bransgore and Burley ward councillor Mark Steele, who made complaints of bullying which were not upheld by the council's monitoring officer.  The resulting by-election, held two days before Christmas, returned former ward councillor (2014-19) Richard Frampton who had previously sat on New Forest council for the both the Conservatives and the Lib Dems; the defending Conservative candidate actually fell to third place behind the Greens.  There were no such shenanigans in the former Ringwood East and Sopley ward, which was very strongly Conservative to the point where it was left uncontested in 2015.
</p><p>
Two long-serving members of the Conservative awkward squad, Sir Christopher Chope and Sir Desmond Swayne, live in this ward and are electors in this by-election.  Sir Desmond has represented this area in Parliament since 1997 as part of the New Forest West constituency, and even in the carnage of July 2024 he had no problem being re-elected for his eighth term of office.  The ward is split between the Brockenhurst and Ringwood divisions of Hampshire county council, which were both very safe Conservative when they were last contested in 2021.  And the Tories did manage to keep control of New Forest council in 2023 - but they still lost nearly half of their seats in the process, falling from 46 seats out of 60 to 26 out of 48.
</p><p>
Two of those Tory losses came in Bransgore, Burley, Sopley and Ringwood East ward, which turned in a close three-way result when it was first contested in 2023.  Independent candidate Nigel Linford finished top of the poll with 34%, and the other seat went to Neil Millington of the Green Party on 31%; the Conservatives finished close behind on 28%.  Millington stepped down from New Forest council in December 2024 because he is moving away from the area.
</p><p>
So this will be a difficult defence for the Green Party candidate Barbara Czoch, who is a carpenter and foster carer.  There is no independent candidate this time.  The Conservatives have selected former councillor Richard Frampton who is hoping to make it a hat-trick of by-election wins here, having won the previous Bransgore and Burley by-elections in 2014 (as a Conservative) and 2021 (as an independent).  Also on the ballot are Sally Johnston for Labour, Adam Elcock for Reform UK and Iestyn Lewis for the Lib Dems.

Andrew's Previews started this week with a Welsh by-election in Haverfordwest on Tuesday, and we'll finish today with another Welsh by-election in the Valleys.  The village/council estate of Trevethin lies just outside the Bannau Brycheniog or Brecon Beacons National Park, clinging to the eastern slopes of the Afon Lwyd valley, and in the large old parish which was named after the village a town grew up during the Industrial Revolution, harnessing the power of the river and the coal and iron ore in the ground.  That town was Pontypool, which developed into an important metalworking (particularly ironworking), coalmining and railways centre.
</p><p>
Those industries are of course gone, and when this column previously looked at the former Trevethin ward seven years ago (<em>Andrew's Previews 2018</em>, page 79) we noted that it was one of the most deprived parts of Wales and made several of the top 100 wards in England and Wales lists from the 2011 census.  Boundary changes in 2022, which merged Trevethin ward with the former ward of St Cadocs and Penygarn, have taken the ward out of the top 100 list for routine occupations and for long-term sickness or disability, but the deprivation and its associated issues remain a long way from being solved.  In the 2021 census Trevethin and Penygarn remained in the top 100 wards in England and Wales for residents with no religion (59.4%) and residents born in the UK (97.8%).
</p><p>
The 2022 boundary changes which merged Trevethin ward with St Cadocs and Penygarn ward also cut the area's representation on Torfaen council from three councillors to two.  In the end the Labour slate of Sue Malson and John Horlor was opposed only by a single Conservative candidate, who lost 76-24.  Effectively the seat which disappeared was that held by independent councillor Louise Shepphard, who didn't seek re-election; Malson had previously been the councillor for St Cadocs and Penygarn, while Horlor transferred from the abolished Pontnewynydd ward.

The Torfaen council area is the basis for constituencies in both Parliaments.  The Westminster seat, which has the same boundaries as the council area, has been represented in Westminster since 2015 by Nick Thomas-Symonds, who is a junior minister with the roles of Paymaster General, minister for the Cabinet Office and minister for the Constitution and EU Relations.  Torfaen has been represented in Cardiff Bay since the establishment of the original Assembly in 1999 by Labour MS Lynne Neagle, who is the Welsh cabinet secretary for education; her seat is slightly smaller than the council area.  Both Neagle and Thomas-Symonds have safe seats, with second place going to the Conservatives in 2021 and Reform UK in 2024.

</p><p>
Labour also control Torfaen council, with the 2022 elections returning 30 Labour and 10 independent councillors.  At a by-election in 2023 an independent councillor succeeded another independent in Llantarnam ward in Cwmbran (<em>Andrew's Previews 2023</em>, page 37); the three independent councillors for that ward have subsequently joined Reform UK.
</p><p>
This by-election is to replace Labour councillor Sue Malson following her resignation in November.  Malson, who was first elected for St Cadocs and Penygarn ward in 2017 and transferred to the wider Trevethin and Penygarn ward in 2022, was the council's Gypsy Traveller champion and she is thought to be the first Torfaen councillor from that community.  She hit the headlines in January last year after posting a very sweary video on her social media, apparently in response to unnamed men who had made false accusations against her.
</p><p>
Defending this seat for Labour is Toniann Phillips, who is a former teaching assistant and treasurer of a community centre in Trevethin.  This time there is no Conservative candidate, so Labour's opposition will come from the Greens' Tony Clark, independent candidate Catherine Howells, Reform UK's Stuart Keyte, and independent candidate and former Trevethin ward councillor Louise Shepphard.
