Pre-New Town Runcorn was a lot smaller when the modern system of single-member Parliamentary seats became the norm in 1885.  Cheshire was a net loser from that redistribution, largely as a result of Parliament's decision to disenfranchise Macclesfield following a series of corrupt elections there, and the county went down from 14 MPs to 13 (elected from 12 constituencies, as Stockport was a two-seat borough).  Eight of Cheshire's MPs were elected from county constituencies, and the two which concern us here are Northwich and Eddisbury.

The Northwich constituency of 1885 was based on the Weaver valley and the industrial towns therein, including Middlewich, Winsford and Runcorn.  It was dominated by the salt-mining industry, which literally changed the landscape during this period: Northwich had been so thoroughly undermined by brime pumping to extract salt from the ground that the town suffered massively from subsidence in the 19th and 20th centuries.   This problem remains so acute that there is still a quango in existence, the Cheshire Brine Subsidence Compensation Board, which assess damages and pays compensation for subsidence damage caused by brine pumping.  Much of the extracted salt was transported down the Weaver Navigation to Runcorn, from where it was either exported or consumed by the chemical industry.

Which makes it appropriate that Northwich's first MP was a chemical entrepreneur.  John Brunner - who became Sir John Brunner, 1st Baronet in 1895 - was the Brunner in Brunner Mond and Company, which had made its fortune on exclusive UK and US rights to the Solvay process for making soda ash.  Invented in 1861 by the Belgian chemist Ernest Solvay, this process uses salt brine, limestone and heat to create bicarbonate of soda via a complex series of chemical reactions: its only waste product is calcium chloride, a relatively harmless chemical which has a number of industrial and other uses.  Brunner and Mond were able to make the Solvay process a commercial success from their large factory at Winnington near Northwich, which started production in 1874, and by the end of the century the previous Leblanc process for making soda ash (whose byproducts were the far more environentally-damaging hydrochloric acid and calcium sulphate) had been more or less abandoned on financial grounds.  In 1900 Brunner Mond was the UK's wealthiest chamical company, and when it merged with three other companies to form ICI in 1926 its market capitalisation was equivalent to well over £1 billion in today's money.

John Brunner was the subject of a biography in 1970 by Stephen Koss which was titled <em>Radical Plutocrat</em>.  These days those words might conjure up an image of a tech bro, but Brunner was a very different type of person.  He a Unitarian with a local reputation as a paternalistic employer, and he ploughed a lot of his wealth back into the community in Northwich, Runcorn and his native Liverpool (a number of chairs at Liverpool University were endowed by him).  For example, Brunner put £68,000 of his own money into the building of the Runcorn and Widnes Transporter Bridge, opened the bridge himself in 1905 when Edward VII (who had been booked to do the honours) pulled out, and then he gave his interest in the bridge away to Widnes Corporation once it became apparent a few years later that the bridge was never going to make a profit.

All this made Brunner a natural fit for the Liberal Party in the late Victorian era, and he won all but one election in Northwich between 1885 and 1910.  The exception was 1886, when the Liberal Party had split over the issue of Irish home rule and Brunner was challenged in the general election by Robert Verdin, standing as a Liberal Unionist candidate.  Verdin and his brothers (his brother William Verdin had stood against Brunner on the Conservative ticket in 1885) were even more heavily involved in the Cheshire salt industry: the family firm Joseph Verdin and Sons was the UK's largest salt manufacturer, and the Verdin family also did its fair share of philanthropy in the Cheshire salt towns.  To this day one of the electoral wards for Winsford is called Over and Verdin.  Robert Verdin unseated Joshn Brunner in 1886 by 458, but he died the following year and the resulting Northwich by-election of 13th August 1887 brought John Brunner back to Parliament with a large majority over the new Liberal Unionist candidate, Lord Henry Grosvenor.  Only in 1900 did his majority subsequently fall below 10 points.

Sir John Brunner, 1st Baronet retired in January 1910 on health grounds, although he didn't leave politics entirely and he was subsequently elected to Surrey county council.  His son and the heir to the baronetcy, also called John Brunner, was by this point already in the Commons as Liberal MP for Leigh, and he moved to Cheshire to take over his father's seat.  In his younger days Brunner junior had nearly died in 1890 while swimming in Lake Como in Italy, and unfortunately his brother Sidney drowned in the process of rescuing him.  These days John Brunner II is probably best known for his famous descendent: he was the maternal grandfather of the Duchess of Kent, although he died in 1929 before she was bown.

Boundary changes for the 1918 general election added Sandbach to the Northwich constituency, but a far more consequential change was that John Brunner II did not get the Coalition government's coupon.  This instead went to Conservative candidate Harry Dewhurst, a businessman who owned four cotton mills in the Preston area and was a member of the Cheshire Hunt.  In the First World War Dewhurst had served in England and France as a remount officer with the Army rank of major, and then as a King's Messenger for the Admiralty with the naval rank of lieutenant-commander.  He went on to defeat John Brunner in 1918 by the very comfortable margin of 61-39.  Sir John Brunner, 2nd Baronet, turned up later in the 1923-24 Parliament as Liberal MP for Southport, but that was the end of his time in Northwich.

Lt-Cdr Dewhurst retired from the Commons in 1922 after one term and successfully passed his seat on to the new Conservative candidate.  Lord Colum Crichton-Stuart was a younger son of the 3rd Marquess of Bute, and his previous career had been in the diplomatic service with overseas postings to Cairo and Christiania (the city now known as Oslo).  He had been unsuccessful in his first parliamentary campaign, in Cardiff East in 1918.

Crichton-Stuart went on to serve as MP for Northwich for 23 years, but only in 1931 could his seat be counted as safe.  In his first election in 1922 Crichton-Stuart was challenged by John Williams, a Labour Party organiser associated with the National Union of General Workers; this job was based out of Manchester, and Williams subsequently served as a Manchester city councillor.  He lost in 1922 by 2,388 votes, and then finished third behind the Liberals in a close three-way result the following year.

In 1924 Labour changed their candidate for Northwich to Barbara Ayrton-Gould, a former suffragist who had been arrested in 1912 as part of the WSPU's window-breaking campaign.  (Her mother, Hertha Ayrton, was a noted physicist who had designed a fan to blow poison gas out of the First World War trenches.)  At her first attempt she finished 2,915 votes behind Crichton-Stuart.  Her second attempt in 1929 resulted in one of the closest Parliamentary election results of all time, as Lord Colum Crichton-Stuart won his fourth term of office with 15,477 votes to Ayrton-Gould's 15,473, a majority of just four votes.  A further 14,163 votes had been cast for the Liberal candidate John Barlow, of whom more later, meaning that both the Conservative winning share of the vote was just 34.3%.  Barbara Ayrton-Gould tried again in 1931, but this was the year of the National Government and round 3 of Crichton-Stuart v Ayrton-Gould finished with a Conservative majority of over 14,000.

Lord Colum Crichton-Stuart stood down at the 1945 election, which resulted in another photofinish.  On this cccasion the Liberal candidate was John Brunner II's son Sir Felix Brunner, 3rd Baronet, who saved his deposit but didn't poll much better than that.  That left a faceoff between two lawyers for the Northwich seat.  On the Labour side was Robert Chorley, who was the Sir Ernest Cassel professor of commercial and industrial law at the University of London and had served in a number of civil service and civil defence rules during the Second World War.  On the Conservative side was international law specialist John Foster, the Recorder of Oxford, who had spent the war as a legal advisor to the British Embassy in Washington DC and later to General Dwight Eisenhower, for which he received the military rank of brigadier.  In the election, Foster defeated Chorley by 20,198 votes to 20.183, holding the Northwich seat with a majority of fifteen votes.  Before the year was out Chorley was in Parliament as the first Lord Chorley, working as a government whip in the House of Lords, while Foster was in Germany working on the Nuremberg trials.  Foster went on to have a long Parliamentary career, much of which was spent advocating for Holocaust survivors and other victims of persecution, but he leaves our story after 1950 when boundary changes took Runcorn out of his Northwich constituency.

Meanwhile the towns of Frodsham and Helsby were included within the Eddisbury constituency.  Named after an ancient Hundred of Cheshire, this was a very rural and agricultural seat covering the countryside to the east of Chester.  While the Eddisbury seat of 1885-1950 was certainly Tory-inclined, it wasn't overly safe and the 1885 election resulted in a majority of just 121 votes for the Conservative candidate Henry Tollemache.  He was a major landowner in the seat who had been one of the outgoing MPs for the predecessor seat of West Cheshire, and during his time in the Commons he co-founded a local newspaper firm in Chester.  Most of his rare intervetions in the chamber were on agricultural issues.  At his final election in 1900 nobody could be found who was prepared to take Tollemache on, and he was re-elected unopposed.

Tollemache retired in 1906, at which point Eddisbury fell in the Liberal landslide of that year.  The Cosnervative candidate Edward Cotton-Jodrell (seeking to return after standing down as MP for Wirral six years previously) lost by 1,123 votes to the Liberal candidate Arthur Stanley.  He was a barrister and London county councillor who had served in the Boer War and was the heir to three separate peerages (the titles of Lord Stanley of Alderley, Lord Sheffield and Lord Eddisbury).

Stanley served one term before losing both 1910 elections in Eddisbury to the Conservatives' Harry Barnston, who had majorities of 688 votes in January and 289 votes in December.  He did not return to Parliament until 1925, when he succeeded to his father's titles and entered the Lords as the fifth Lord Stanley of Alderley (and the fifth Lord Sheffield, and the fourth Lord Eddisbury).  In between Stanley spent the First World War in Australia, where he served from 1914 to 1920 as Governor of Victoria.

Harry Barnston, who had unsuccessfuly stood in Stockport in 1906 before being elected for Eddisbury in January 1910, was the lord of the manor of Farndon near Crewe, and he was a captain in the Cheshire Imperial Yeomanry.  He served in France during his time in Parliament, and enjoyed no fewer than three uncontested elections in Eddisbury after the First World War: Barnston was elected unopposed in the 1918 general election with the coupon, in a ministerial by-election on 19th April 1921 after he had joined the government as Comptroller of the Household, and in the 1922 general election.  As such the 1923 general election was the first contested poll in Eddisbury for 13 years, and it turned out to be a close contest between Harry Barnston and the Liberal candidate R J Russell: Barnston won by 8,716 votes to 8,520, a majority of 196.  A rematch between Barnston (who by now had been made a baronet) and Russell in 1924 saw a larger Conservative majority, but the Eddisbury seat was not safe.  The 1924 election returned the Conservatives to power, and Barnston resumed his previuos post as Comptroller of the Household - this time with no by-election required.

Sir Harry Barnston died in February 1929 at the age of 58, leaving no heir to his baronetcy and a tricky succession problem for the Conservatives.  The resulting second Eddisbury by-election was held on 20th March 1929 and was widely seen as a warmup for the upcoming general election.  The Conservatives selected Roderick Fenwick-Palmer, who was well-known in Cheshire hunting circles and was chairman of the party's Wrexham branch; the Liberals readoped R(ichard) J(ohn) Russell, an alderman of Birkenhead and dental surgeon who had continued to nurse the seat through the previous Parliament.  The by-election was a straight fight between them, and R J Russell emerged victorious by 10,223 votes to 8,931, gaining the seat for the Liberals with a majority of 1,292.  A rematch between Russell and Fenwick-Palmer at the 1929 general election two months later resulted in a win for Russell by 825 votes.

That proved to the last contested election in Eddisbury for 14 years, because Russell was on the Simonite wing of the Liberal Party which supported the National Government in 1931.  He was therefore re-elected unopposed a the Liberal National MP for Eddisbury in both 1931 and 1935.  The official Liberals had intended to stand against him at the general election in 1939 or 1940, but the outbreak of the Second World War meant that election never took place.

R J Russell died in February 1943 at the age of 70.  The resulting third Eddisbury by-election of 7th April 1943 did not have an officail Liberal candidate owing to the wartrime political truce, but it was contested nonethelss.  In fact the candidate list was a bit of a mess, characterised as between "a Conservative who called himself a 'Liberal National', a Liberal who wanted to call himself 'the Liberal' but couldn't and the son of a Liberal".  The first of these was the defending Liberal National candidate Thomas Peacock CBE, a farmer who was a Cheshire county councillor and a former president of the National Farmers Union.  Peacock was known to be a Conservative, and his selection irritated the local Liberal party so much that they nominated their own Independent Liberal candidate: Harold Heathcote-Williams was a barrister who had alraedy stood for Parliament four times without success (three times in Poplar South, once in Knutsford).  Finally the son of a Liberal was Warrant Officer John Loverseed, an RAF fighter pilot who had served on the Republican side in the Spanish Civil War and then in the Battle of Britain, winning the Air Force Cross; his father, also called John Loverseed, had been the Liberal MP for Sudbury in the 1923-24 Parliament.  Loverseed was standing for Common Wealth, a left-wing party co-founded by the former Liberal MP Sir Richard Acland and the independent MP Vernon Bartlett.   In an upset reult, Loverseed won the 1943 Eddisbury by-election with a majority of 486 votes over Peacock, becoming Common Wealth's third MP; Eddisbury marked the party's first by-election win.  Two others followed, Skipton in 1944 and Chelmsford in 1945.

By 1945 John Loverseed had left Common Wealth and he stood for re-election as a Labour candidate.  This was the first time that Labour had stood in Eddisbury, but they were unable to capitalise on Loverseed's popularity.  On this occasion the Liberal Nationals selected Sir John Barlow, 2nd Barnonet, who as a Liberal candidate had previously finished third in the three-way photofinish result in Northwich 16 years earlier.  The official Liberals did stand against Barlow: they selected Commander Dunstan Curtis DSC, a solicitor who had had an eventful war in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve (including accepting the surrender of Kiel) and is sometimes cited as an inspiration for the character of James Bond.  Curtis only narrowly saved his deposit, and Sir John Barlow regained the Eddisbury seat very easily for the Liberal Nationals with a majority of 7,902 votes over Loverseed.

The 1950 boundary changes radically redrew this corner of Cheshire, creating a Runcorn parliamentary seat for the first time.  This was before Runcorn was designeted as a New Town, and the new constituency contained not only Frodsham and Hsleby but also the part of the what is now the borough of Warrington south of the Manchester Ship Canal, including some affluent southern Warrington suburbs and the even more affluent town of Lymm.  It proved to be a true blue seat, but not for Sir John Barlow who saw his Eddisbury seat disappear: Barlow tried to seek re-election in Walsall, without success, before resurfacing as the Conservative MP for Middleton and Prestwich.

The Runcorn constituency of 1950-83 was a safe Conservative seat which had just two MPs during its existence.  Elected here in 1950 was Dennis Vosper, who served in the Commons for 14 years and was on the Conservative frontbench for nearly all of that time, in a number of junior ministerial roles including a brief period in Cabinet in 1957: Vosper was appointed as Minister of Health, but was forced to resign that role a few months later due to illness.

Dennis Vosper retired to the Lords in 1964, taking the title of Lord Runcorn, and he passed his seat on to Mark Carlisle, a barrister who had previously had two unsuccessful Parliamentary campaigns in St Helens.  Runcorn proved to be a much safer berth for one of the most high-profile Tory "wets".  Carlisle's political career peaked in 1979 when he joined the first Thatcher cabinet as secretary of state for education and science, a role in which he served for two years before being discmissed in 1981.  His main political legacy was the Assisted Places Scheme, which aimed to give bright working-class children free or subsidised places at public schools.

Further major Parliamentary boundary changes came in 1983, reflecting three major changes since 1950.  Nine years previously, local government reorganisation had transferred Widnes and Warrington into Cheshire; transport links between Widnes and Runcorn had been seriously improved with the opening of the Silver Jubilee Bridge in the 1960s; and the dssignation of Runcorn as a New Town had led to major population growth.  The new county boundaries left Widnes somewhat out on a limb, with not enough electors for a parliamentary seat of its own and only two options for getting it up to the right size: add bits of Warrington to the east, or add bits of Runcorn to the south.  Since Widnes and Runcorn were now covered by the same borough (Halton), the latter option was chosen: this left Runcorn town split between constituencies, with the town centre in the new Halton cosntituency while the east of the town was placed in a new seat called Warrington South.  Meanwhile Frodsham and Helsby were transferred back to a recreated Eddisbury seat.

The new Warrington South was the main successor to the old Runcorn constituency, and Mark Carlisle sought re-election there.  In 1987 he retired to the Lords (taking the title Lord Carlisle of Bucklow) and passed the seat on to new Conservative candidate Chris Butler, who had lost the Brecon and Radnor by-election to the Liberal Democrats two years previously.  On that occasion Bell's majority fell to 3,609 votes over Labour candidate Albert Booth, who had served as employment secretary in the Callaghan government and had lost his seat in Barrow and Furness in 1983.  In 1992 Butler in turn lost his seat to Labour candidate Mike Hall, the leader of Warrington council, who won Warrington South by just 191 votes.  (Sarah Hall, who now represents the seat of the same name, is Mike's daughter-in-law.)

Meanwhile the recreated Eddisbury seat was held with large majorities throughout the period 1983-97 by the long-serving Conservative MP Alastair Goodlad, who transferred here from the abolished Northwich seat.  For nearly all of this period Goodlad was either on the Conservative frontbench or in the Whips office, with his career peaking as Government Chief Whip from 1995 to 1997 - a thankless task at the best of times, but particularly so at the tailend of the Major government as by-election losses whittled its majority down to nothing.  Goodlad leaves our story following the 1997 boundary changes, and he left these shores two years after that to become the UK's high commissioner to Australia; he now sits in the Lords as Lord Goodlad.

By contrast, the Halton cosntituency of 1983-2024 was a very safe Labour seat throughout its existence.  Runcorn's first Labour MP was Gordon Oakes, a solicitor who had represented the predecessor Widnes seat since a 1971 by-election; Widnes and then Halton proved to be a much safer berth than Bolton West, which Oakes had previously represented in the 1966-70 Parliament.

Oakes retired in 1997 and passed the Halton seat on to Labour MP Derek Twigg, who had started his political career by being elected to Cheshire county council in 1981 at the age of 21; he came to Parliament from a long career in the civil service.  Twigg won seven terms of office as MP for Halton, and he is still in Parliament today as the Labour MP for Widnes and Halewood: he is one of 13 remaining MPs from the large Labour 1997 intake.

Tha Halton seat was left more or less intact by the 1997 boundary changes, but further population growth in Warrington had forced the creation of a new constituency in Cheshire for the 1997 general election.  This seat took in the eastern part of Runcorn New Town in the north, Frodsham and Hsleby to the west, and Northwich to the east.  It was called Weaver Vale, and at its first election in 1997 it returned the outgoing Warrington South Labour MP Mike Hall with a large majority of 13,448 votes.

Hall won two more terms of office here before retiring in 2010, at which point Weaver Vale was gained by the Conservatives.  The new Conservative MP Graham Evans, who had been selected by an open primary, had previously served for ten years on Macclesfield council and came to politics from a career in manfacturing.  He is now in the Lords as Lord Evans of Rainow, having received a life peerage in Boris Johnson's 2022 resignation honours, and he was a Lords whip until the Conservatives lost power last year.  Evans' two terms in the Commons both followed close results, with a Cosnervative majority of 991 votes in 2010 falling to 806 votes in 2015.

In 2017, Graham Evans was one of the Conservatives who unexpectedly lost their seats as Theresa May's election campaign imploded.  The beneficiary of this was Labour candidate Mike Amesbury, a former careers advisor and Labour Party adviser who had previously served on Manchester city council for eleven years, including four years in the council's cabinet with the culture and leisure portfolio.  He defeated Evans by 3,928 votes in 2017 and was re-elected for a second term in 2019 with a majority of 562 votes.
