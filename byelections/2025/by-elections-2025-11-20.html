"All the right votes, but not necessarily in the right order"
</blockquote>
</p><p>
Seven by-elections on 20th November 2025:
</p><p>
<h2>Stranraer and the Rhins</h2>
</p><p>
<em>Dumfries and Galloway council, Scotland; caused by the resignation of independent councillor Willie Scobie.</em>
</p><p>
It's always nice when Andrew's Previews has a week with something for everyone, and this is one of those weeks.  Today's polls run the gamut from deprived urban areas through comfortable suburbia to small towns and villages.  Of the seven seats up for election today, the Conservatives and Labour are defending two each and the other three polls are to replace Green Party, Liberal Democrat and independent councillors.
</p><p>
Our first two polls today are both in areas containing important ports.  We'll start in the south-west corner of Scotland, which has always been a major focus for maritime traffic because this is the shortest and most convenient sailing route from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.  From the village of Portpatrick on the west coast of the Rhins of Galloway, the Northern Irish coast is just 21 miles away.
</p><p>
The Rhins themselves are a pair of peninsulas which point south into the Irish Sea and north into the Firth of Clyde.  This is relatively low-lying land with its own warm and wet microclimate thanks to the Gulf Stream.  Near the village of Port Logan on the South Rhins can be found the Logan Botanic Garden, an offshoot of the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh where tropical plants are grown.  Not too far from here is Scotland's southernmost point at the Mull of Galloway, which is run by the RSPB as a nature reserve.  At 54 degrees 38 minutes North, the Mull of Galloway has the same latitude as Hartlepool.
</p><p>
The North Channel came to wider notice at the start of 2020 when Boris Johnson, who was the Prime Minister then, proposed building a bridge across it to link Northern Ireland to Great Britain.  Such a project faces many engineering obstacles, not least that the North Channel has unusually deep water.  Beaufort's Dyke, a trench which runs roughly parallel to the west coast of the Rhins, reaches up to 300 metres deep and has been historically used as a dumping ground for unexploded conventional and chemical weapons left over from the Second World War.  Some of this ordnance exploded on the seabed in 1986, creating an earthquake measured at 2.5 on the Richter scale; dredging in 1996 for the construction of a gas pipeline led to phosphorus bombs washing up on the Scottish coast.  And also lurking in the waters somewhere down there is around 2 tonnes of low-level nuclear waste, consisting of luminous paint and irradiated rubbish from laboratories inside metal drums encased in concrete.  Disturbing all this with bridge construction work would be both difficult and inadvisable.
</p><p>
So, for the foreseeable future the link from Galloway to Northern Ireland will rely on ferries across the North Channel.  Originally this took the form of a daily packet boat between Portpatrick and Donaghadee in County Down, but by the 17th century the main settlement in this area - indeed, the main settlement in the whole of the county of Wigtownshire - had become the town of Stranraer.  This town is located at the southern end of Loch Ryan in a much more sheltered position than Portpatrick, and when the railway came to Stranraer in 1861 (on a now-closed line from Dumfries) the town became the main ferry port for travel to Northern Ireland.  It retained that position for over a century.
</p><p>
But the ferries no longer go all the way to Stranraer harbour.  The ferry companies have abandoned the town in favour of Cairnryan, a small village on the eastern bank of Loch Ryan which is conveniently located on the main road towards Ayr and Glasgow.  Cairnryan had been developed as a military port during the Second World War, and it then became a centre for shipbreaking before Townsend Thoresen (who are now P&O Ferries) started their ferry link from Cairnryan to Larne in County Antrim in 1973.  In 2011 Stena Line moved their Stranraer-Belfast service to Cairnryan, ending nearly 150 years of ferry services from Stranraer harbour.  This has created the problem of regenerating the former harbour space together with Stranraer's railway station, which has a limited service of five daily trains to and from Ayr: the railway station was located to be convenient for the port rather than the town centre.
</p><p>
The ferries from Cairnryan normally run without incident, but the North Channel was the scene of one of the UK's deadliest ferry disasters.  The 31st January and 1st February 1953 are remembered for the great North Sea floods which killed hundreds of people on the coasts of England and nearly 2,000 people in the Netherlands.  The floods were the result of a spring tide and a severe windstorm, and the greatest single loss of life in that storm came in the North Channel when the car ferry <em>Princess Victoria</em> was swamped by high seas and sank on a journey from Stranraer to Belfast.  135 lives were lost.  The death toll included two high-ranking politicians: Maynard Sinclair was the Northern Ireland finance minister and MP for Belfast Cromac in the Parliament of Northern Ireland, while Sir Walter Smiles was the Unionist MP for North Down.  The North Down by-election to replace Smiles was won by his daughter Patricia Ford, whose family links to the Commons don't end there: Ford's second husband Sir Nigel Fisher, stepson Mark Fisher and son-in-law Sir Michael Grylls all served as MPs.  Patricia Ford was also the grandmother of the explorer and former Chief Scout Bear Grylls.
</p><p>
In Scotland's devolved legislature, Stranraer is part of the Galloway and West Dumfries constituency.  This has been represented since its creation in 2011 by the Conservatives, and its MSP since 2016 has been Finlay Carson who is convenor of the Parliament's rural affairs committee.  In 2021 the Scottish National Party candidate for the seat was Emma Harper, who was elected to Holyrood via the alternative route of becoming a regional MSP for South Scotland.  Carson and Harper will face off again at the 2026 Holyrood elections.
</p><p>
The Westminster constituency covering this area is Dumfries and Galloway, which has been in Conservative hands since 2017.  Until 2024 this seat was represented by Allister Jack, now Lord Jack of Courance, who served in Cabinet as Scottish secretary throughout the Johnson, Truss and Sunak administrations - a notable achievement in such chaotic political times.  Jack stood down in 2024 and was replaced by new Conservative MP John Cooper, a former journalist who had previously edited the <em>Stranraer and Wigtownshire Free Press</em>.  Cooper was elected last year with under 30% of the vote and a majority of 930 thanks to an even split of votes between the SNP and Labour in second and third place.
</p><p>
The Conservatives were also the largest party on Dumfries and Galloway council at the 2022 Scottish local elections.  Scores on the doors here were 16 seats for the Conservatives, 11 for the SNP, 9 Labour, 6 independents and a Lib Dem.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2022/dumgal22s.svgz" alt="Dumfries and Galloway, 2022" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
The Tories formed a minority administration which continues to run the council, but their local party branch has fallen apart a bit and there are only nine councillors left in the ruling group.  The four Conservative councillors representing wards in Wigtownshire all walked out in June to form a splinter group called Novantae, after a former Iron Age tribe who were recorded by Ptolemy as living in what is now Galloway.  The trigger for this split appears to have been the rejection by the Scottish Government of proposals to designate most of Galloway as a national park: the proposed national park had been opposed by the council administration, but the splinter group were in favour of it.
</p><p>
Two of the four Novantae councillors are the sitting Conservative councillors for Stranraer and the Rhins ward, which returns four councillors by proportional representation.  However, the PR system has found it difficult to deal with the popular support in Stranraer for Willie Scobie, who is apparently notable enough for Wikipedia.  Scobie had been a councillor for Stranraer continuously since 1988, when he was first elected to the former Wigtownshire council.  He is now 75 and he retired in September after 37 years in office, citing underlying health conditions for his resignation.
</p><p>
Originally Scobie was a Labour councillor, but in 2012 he sought re-election as an independent candidate in what was then Stranraer and North Rhins ward, and he polled a massive 62% of the first preferences - almost 2.5 times the 25% quota required for election.  If there had been three Willie Scobies he would have won all three seats on that occasion; instead, the ward's other two seats went to the SNP and Labour, who came from behind to beat the Conservatives on Scobie's surplus transfers.
</p><p>
Boundary changes for the 2017 election added the South Rhins and a fourth councillor to this ward, and the beneficiary of that expansion was the Conservatives' Andrew Giusti.  First preferences on that occasion were 37% for Scobie, 32% for the Conservatives and 15% for the SNP; there was only one Willie Scobie and the Conservatives had only stood one candidate, so the transferable vote system gave the final seat to Labour's Tommy Sloan who had started on just 5.9%.
</p><p>
In 2022 the Conservatives went for two seats in Stranraer and the Rhins and they got them, with the outgoing Labour councillor Sloan standing for re-election as an independent and losing his seat.  Vote shares were 40% and two seats for the Conservatives, and 23% and one seat each for the SNP and Scobie.  If we rerun the count for a single seat then the Conservatives' Andrew Giusti beats Scobie by the narrow margin of 1,963 votes to 1,930, or 50.4-49.6 in percentage terms.  If we eliminate Scobie and redistribute his votes, then the starting point is 45% for the Conservatives, 26% for the SNP and 14% for independent Tommy Sloan, with the Conservatives beating the SNP after transfers by 60-40.  So on paper the Conservatives look well-placed to make a gain in this by-election, but one wonders what effect the defection of all their Wigtownshire councillors to Novantae might have had.
</p><p>
One independent candidate has come forward to succeed Willie Scobie: Shaun Smith is a digital creator who runs a sweetshop in Stranraer and also has his own wedding and event design firm.  The Conservatives' Julie Currie works in public health improvement for the NHS and also runs two holiday lets in the area.  The Scottish National Party have selected Simon Jones, who like Smith and Currie is standing for election for the first time.  Also on the ballot here are John McCutcheon for Labour, Michael Havard for the Scottish Greens, John Roberts for Reform UK, Gisele Skinner for the Heritage Party and Tracey Warman for the Lib Dems.  The usual Scottish comments apply here: Votes at 16 and the Alternative Vote are in use at this by-election.

<h2>South Bank</h2>
</p><p>
<em>Redcar and Cleveland council, North Yorkshire; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Izzy Attwood.</em>
</p><p>
We now cross south of the Border for an episode of the South Bank Show.  But Melvyn Bragg this is not.  We are on the industrial South Bank of the River Tees, in an area which has been politically controversial for a long time.
</p><p>
The South Bank ward of Redcar and Cleveland is dominated by the vacant site previously occupied by the Teesside steelworks, which turned iron into steel from the middle of the 19th century until the final blast furnace went cold in 2015.  All of that site has now been cleared and is awaiting redevelopment, a process which has never been far from the pages of <em>Private Eye</em> for many years.
</p><p>
The old industry hasn't completely gone here, because the ward boundary also includes Teesport.  This is one of the UK's busiest sea ports, importing and exporting bulk cargo (including potash from the Boulby mile) and also handling up to half a million TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units) of containers per year.  P&O Ferries operate daily sailings from Teesport to Rotterdam and Zeebrugge specifically for cargo, and Tesco have a large distribution centre here.
</p><p>
All this industry spawned not just the modern Teesside Freeport but also the 19th-century town of South Bank, which lies 3 miles east of Middlesbrough town centre.  South Bank in Normanby was its own urban district within the North Riding of Yorkshire from 1894 until it became part of Eston Urban District in 1915.  Eston Urban District, which covered eastern suburbs of Middlesbrough, was itself abolished in 1968 when the towns of Middlesbrough, Redcar and Stockton-on-Tees came under the single administration of Teesside County Borough; the 1970s reorganisation split those towns apart again, but it did not recreate Eston as an independent town.  Famous sons and daughters of South Bank include the legendary and much-missed magician Paul Daniels, whose first job was as a junior clerk in the Eston Urban District Council treasurer's office.
</p><p>

</p><p>
South Bank is now administered as part of Redcar and Cleveland district, even though it's much closer to Middlesbrough than it is to Redcar.  It's the first stop out of Middlesbrough for stopping trains on the line to Redcar and Saltburn.  The ward boundaries also include the former British Steel Redcar railway station, which lies in the middle of the redevelopment site and lost effectively all of its passengers when the steelworks closed.  No trains have called at British Steel Redcar since December 2019, and the station is officially mothballed.
</p><p>
This deprived area of Teesside has normally returned Labour councillors over the years, with the exception of 2019 when independent candidate Sandra Smith topped the poll.  Labour got that seat back rather resoundingly in 2023, when the Labour slate defeated Smith by 65-22.  The ward is part of the volatile Redcar parliamentary seat which has returned MPs from all three main Westminster parties in this century: its current representative is the Labour Party chair Anna Turley, who recovered a seat in 2024 which she had lost in 2019.
</p><p>
Redcar and Cleveland council has been under no overall control since 2013.  The 2023 elections returned a balanced council with 23 Labour councillors, 13 independents, 12 Conservatives and 11 Lib Dems; following these elections, Labour formed a minority administration.  Since then Labour have lost two seats in by-elections, one to the Conservatives and one to Reform UK: Reform UK's win in Skelton East ward last month was with 65.3% of the vote, which at the time was their record vote share.  That record has since been broken, when RUK polled 65.8% in the Chapel St Leonards by-election last week.
</p><p>
This hy-election in the rather different territory of South Bank ward is to replace Labour councillor Izzy Attwood, who was first elected here in 2023 and tendered her resignation in October.  Attwood has been in poor health for some time and she had not attended a council meeting since November 2024; in May the council voted to grant her a six-month leave of absence, which has now expired.
</p><p>
Defending this seat for Labour is a high-profile candidate.  Susan Jeffrey was the leader of Redcar and Cleveland council from 2015 to 2019 and she has a long political history here: Jeffrey has previously been a South Bank councillor from a 2009 by-election to 2023 on Redcar and Cleveland council, and before that from 1987 to 1991 on the old Langbaurgh council.  There is no independent candidate standing this time and only two other candidates have come forward: they are Richard Kerr-Morgan for the Conservatives and Reform UK's Adam Jones, who is described as South Bank born and bred.

<h2>Hale</h2>
</p><p>
<em>Trafford council, Greater Manchester; caused by the resignation of Green Party councillor Owain Sutton.</em>
</p><p>
The central section of this week's column will feature Cheshire past and present.  In Cheshire past we find Hale, a former Urban District of Cheshire which is now on the southern edge of Greater Manchester.  This was a small place just to the south of Altrincham until the railways came here in 1862, and Hale railway station lies on the Mid-Cheshire line from Manchester to Chester via Altrincham and Knutsford.
</p><p>
In many ways Hale has the demographics of a classic London railway commuter town, but its census return sticks out even more in the context of north-west England.  In the 2021 census Hale Central, the predecessor to this ward, made the top 10 wards in north-west England for residents educated to degree level, at 62.0% of adults; it had the north-west's highest proportion of residents employed in professional, scientific and technical activities (17.0%) and made the top 70 wards in England and Wales for that statistic; and it had the north-west's second-highest proportion of residents in higher managerial, administrative and professional occupations (33.7%) and made the top 40 in England and Wales for that statistic.  (For those who haven't already guessed, the number 1 ward in north-west England for residents in higher managerial, administrative and professional occupations was Didsbury West.)  This might not quite be the super-rich <em>Real Housewives of Cheshire</em> territory of nearby Hale Barns, but it's certainly a comfortable enough place to live.
</p><p>
Hale urban district was absorbed in 1974 into the Metropolitan Borough of Trafford, which has swung very hard to the left over the last decade.  The latest council composition has 41 Labour councillors against 9 Conservatives, 7 Lib Dems and 5 Greens plus this vacancy.  But Trafford was the last Greater Manchester borough to have a Conservative majority, and wards like Hale are places which the Conservatives should arguably never have lost.
</p><p>
And the old Hale Central used to be a very safe Conservative ward - until 2021, when the Green Party decided to have a go here.  Their candidate Jane Leicester came up just short on that occasion, but she stood again the following year and won easily.
</p><p>
Boundary changes in 2023 then saw Hale Central ward renamed as simply Hale.  On slightly revised boundaries, the Greens won a full slate of three Hale councillors by defeating the Conservative slate by 49-36.  Owain Sutton, who had finished third of the three Green candidates and therefore got the shortest term, was then re-elected in May 2024 by the slightly smaller margin of 48-37.
</p><p>
That was on the same day as Labour's Andy Burnham was re-elected for his third term as Mayor of Greater Manchester.  Hale is the home ward of Laura Evans, who was the Conservative candidate for Mayor in the 2021 election, and who then ended up standing again in 2024 after the originally-selected Conservative candidate for that election walked off to join Reform UK at the last moment.  Evans has signed the nomination papers for the Conservative candidate in this by-election.  Commendably, the Greater Manchester returning officer has put together ward-level breakdowns of the 2021 and 2024 mayoral counts which are notable for their homogeneity: Burnham carried <em>every single ward</em> in the county in 2021 and missed out on only one ward in 2024.  (Bizarrely, the one that got away last year was Werneth ward in Oldham where the Gaza Independent vote appears have coalesced behind ... ex-Reform UK independent candidate Nick Buckley.)   We can deduce from these ward breakdowns that Laura Evans was such a weak Conservative mayoral candidate that she couldn't even top the poll in Hale.  Twice.
</p><p>
Two months after the 2024 Trafford and mayoral elections, Hale elected a non-Conservative MP for the first time in a century following the retirement of prominent Tory backbencher Sir Graham Brady, who had been the only Conservative MP in Greater Manchester when he was first elected here in 1997.  The Altrincham and Sale West constituency is now represented by Connor Rand, a former USDAW figure and Labour Party backbencher.
</p><p>
The Conservatives did poll impressively well in a Trafford council by-election last month when they gained Broadheath ward in northern Altrincham from Labour, but they face a different opponent in Hale.  This by-election is to replace Green Party councillor Owain Sutton, who tendered his resignation last month for health reasons after two-and-a-half years in office.
</p><p>
Defending this seat for the Greens is Orla Weir, who is standing for election for the first time.  The Conservatives have reselected Natalie Shalom, who stood here last year and got some bad publicity on that occasion for allegedly anti-Islamic social media posts.  Also on the ballot here are Clare Sheridan for Labour, Jason Stack for the Lib Dems and Phil Holt for Reform UK.

<h2>Election Court Watch</h2>
</p><p>
Staying in Cheshire, we can report that the Election Court case of <em>Moore v Pochin</em> arising out of May's Runcorn and Helsby by-election has now concluded, following a three-day hearing at Chester Crown Court earlier this month.  I summarised this case before the trial in the 18th September edition of the Previews, and I repeat the relevant points here:
</p><p>
<blockquote>
</p><p>
The legal challenge here does not come from Labour, who were only six votes away from holding the [Runcorn and Helsby] seat. They accept that they lost to [the Reform UK candidate Sarah] Pochin fair and square. Instead the petition ... has been submitted by Graham Moore, who stood in the by-election as the candidate of the English Constitution Party and finished in fifteenth and last place with a total of 50 votes. Remember that figure, it will be important later.
</p><p>
Moore named four respondents to the petition: the chief executive of Royal Mail (which was amended to Royal Mail Group Ltd by the High Court), the chief constable of Cheshire, Pochin and the returning officer. He is unhappy with Royal Mail for allegedly failing to deliver his leaflets, while his beef with Cheshire Constabulary includes unreasonable demands by the police to "furnish us with some more details - how many people are expected, what is the nature of the event, where was it advertised, what time will it be going on etc" and a complaint that they failed to investigate Wikipedia deleting the page for the English Constitution Party during the by-election campaign. Following a preliminary hearing in July, the High Court issued a judgment ... throwing out the claims against Royal Mail and the chief constable on the grounds that these are people you can't bring an election petition against; however Pochin and the returning officer failed in their attempts to get the whole thing struck out, and the trial will proceed later this year.
</blockquote>
</p><p>
(Pausing here, Pochin and the returning officer then went to the Court of Appeal in another attempt to get the whole thing struck out.  They failed there too.)
</p><p>
<blockquote>
</p><p>
No wrongdoing is alleged against Pochin or the Reform UK campaign generally. Instead Moore's ire is focused on the returning officer, who is accused of running a fraudulent and/or erroneous vote count.  ...
</p><p>
Moore also notes that he had stood in the Tooting by-election back in 2016 and also polled 50 votes on that occasion. He states that:
</p><p>
<blockquote>
</p><p>
    "The probability of receiving exactly 50 votes in two unrelated parliamentary elections, nine years apart, in separate constituencies under councils controlled by mainstream parties (Labour and Conservative) protecting the status quo, is not just strange but impossible. The Petitioner's estimate of a 1 in 40,000 "elections" chance assumes a hypothetical scenario of standing in 40,000 by-elections or general elections, which is infeasible, rendering the identical 50-vote counts statistically implausible and indicative of deliberate fraud. The use of bundle counts (typically in 25s or 50s) likely facilitated misallocation of votes, as the 50-vote result aligns suspiciously with standard bundle sizes.
</p><p>
    No other candidate in UK parliamentary by-elections or general elections, to the Petitioner's knowledge, has received the exact same vote total in different constituencies, reinforcing the impossibility of this result absent manipulation."
</blockquote>
</p><p>
When the above paragraph was brought to the attention of one UK election discussion forum, it took less than half an hour for not one but <em>two</em> examples to be posted of Official Monster Raving Loony Party candidates receiving the exact same vote total in different constituencies. One of them was the late and much-missed Screaming Lord Sutch, who scored 506 votes in two different 1990s by-elections (Islwyn 1995 and South East Staffordshire 1996); while in general elections, Nick "The Incredible Flying Brick" Delves polled 162 votes against Ed Miliband in Doncaster North 2015 and another 162 votes against Keir Starmer in Holborn and St Pancras 2024.
</blockquote>
</p><p>
(Defying the laws of gravity is all in a day's work for the Incredible Flying Brick, but this must be the first time he's also been accused of defying the laws of statistics.)
</p><p>
<blockquote>
</p><p>
If we drop the requirement that the constituencies be different, then one Conservative candidate polled exactly 19,843 votes in both 1974 general elections: that total was enough for Tom Iremonger to win Ilford North in February, but he then lost with the same score in October. It seems doubtful that this was the same 19,843 people both times.
</p><p>
This column hasn't tried to work out the reasoning behind Moore's 1 in 40,000 figure, but probability and combinatorics in general is a field of mathematics which is full of counter-intuitive results and general traps for the unwary, and even experienced mathematicians who venture into this area regularly get confused. One reason why bookies remain consistently in business is that the general punter is usually very bad at estimating probabilities.
</p><p>
There's other stuff in the petition about the 1703 decision of <em>Ashby v White</em> and alleged violations of Bill of Rights, the European Convention on Human Rights and the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which the English Constitution Party asserts applies to the English people as an indigenous group. Maybe we'll find out more about how this is relevant when the trial of <em>Moore v Pochin</em> gets going later this year.
</blockquote>
</p><p>
Unfortunately we never did find out from the final judgment how <em>Ashby v White</em> and all the rest of it was relevant.  Most of the judges' reasoning was instead taken up with the conduct of the count and the recount, and the recording of the live BBC feed from the counting hall together with the deputy returning officer's evidence demonstrated that everything was in order throughout the counting process and comprehensively demolished Moore's case.  There were also some harsh words for the statistical analysis, which - quite apart from its mathematical shortcomings - came from a statistician who may well have had an axe to grind against Reform UK.
</p><p>
Mr Justice Bryan and Mr Justice Martin Spencer duly dismissed the petition and confirmed that Reform UK's Sarah Pochin MP had been duly elected.  Chalk that up as another win for the returning officer's counsel Timothy Straker KC, who has been acting in Election Court cases for decades.  A barrister of Straker's experience does not come cheap, as Graham Moore - who represented himself in the proceedings - is now finding out: the Court ordered Moore to pay the legal costs of Ms Pochin (£30,000) and the returning officer (£45,000).
</p><p>
<h2>Macclesfield Central</h2>
</p><p>
<em>Cheshire East council; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Ashley Farrall.</em>
</p><p>
And with that, the Election Court can now go back to sleep until somebody wakes it from its slumber next.  The Court was originally created by the Second Reform Act in 1868 and much of its caselaw is Victorian: <em>Moore v Pochin</em> was only the 17th trial of a parliamentary election petition since 1922.  Fear of the Election Court has done a great deal to clean up our election campaigns from the rampant bribery and corruption of the pre-Reform Act era, but until the 20th century there was an even greater sanction for the very worst of corrupt elections: the entire borough could be disenfranchised and lose its representation in Parliament altogether.
</p><p>
One of the last towns to be punished in this way was Macclesfield.  This Cheshire town had gained representation in Parliament thanks to the First Reform Act in 1832 as a two-seat borough, and after the Second Reform in 1868 its MPs were William Brocklehurst (who took his seat over from his father John Brocklehurst) and David Chadwick of the Liberals.  The 1880 general election saw Brocklehurst and Chadwick re-elected for their third terms of office with majorities of 268 and 66 votes over the lead Conservative candidate William Eaton.  Four electors of the borough took this to the Election Court, and volume 3 of the <em>O'Malley and Hardcastle</em> series of law reports for Election Court cases simply summarised the proceedings in <em>Day v Brocklehurst</em> <!--(1880) 3 O'M & H 100--> thus:
</p><p>
<blockquote>
</p><p>
The petition contained the usual allegation of corrupt practices, but not pray the seat.
</p><p>
It was proved that an organised system of bribery and treating by agent prevailed at the election.
</p><p>
The Court, in giving judgment, declared the election void.
</blockquote>
</p><p>
Brocklehurst and Chadwick were unseated.  A Royal Commission was then asked to investigate further, and their report in April 1881 confirmed that the 1880 general election in Macclesfield had been corrupt from top to bottom.  Parliament refused to issue a writ for a by-election to fill Macclesfield's vacant seats, and when the Third Reform Act was passed in 1885 Macclesfield became one of the last two towns to be disenfranchised for corruption.  (The other was Sandwich.)
</p><p>
Ironically, the 1885 redistribution then created a brand-new Macclesfield constituency, this time as a county division of Cheshire, and its first election was won by none other than William Brocklehurst.  His son, also called William Brocklehurst, went on to serve as Macclesfield's last Liberal MP to date from 1906 to 1918.
</p><p>
The Brocklehursts had major business interests in Macclesfield in those days.  This is a Pennine textile town, but unlike other Pennine textile towns Macclesfield specialised in handling silk.  At one stage the town produced more finished silk than anywhere else in the world.
</p><p>
The Central ward of Macclesfield covers the sort of area you might expect from the name, including all of the town centre.  Its eastern boundary is the railway line, and most intercity trains running south from Manchester call at Macclesfield.  Sadly the S&M Supplies shop next to the station closed down some years ago: this was a hardware store named after its original proprietors Sam and Mabel Gallibrand, so you can stop giggling at the back now.
</p><p>
Macclesfield is actually a rather left-wing town and definitely not <em>Real Housewives of Cheshire</em> territory: the super-rich instead live in villages nearby like Prestbury and Mottram St Andrews.  The Tory vote in Prestbury used to be weighed rather than counted, and that fact will certainly have helped the Conservatives to hold Macclesfield in Parliament throughout the Blair and Brown years.  Another factor then was that Sir Nicholas Winterton, who was the Conservative MP for Macclesfield from a 1971 by-election until 2010, was very well thought of in the town and had a large personal vote.  But Macclesfield is no longer in Conservative hands: it was gained in 2024 by Labour’s Tim Roca, who had previously been the deputy leader of Westminster council.
</p><p>
The Macclesfield council created in 1974, which also included Knutsford and Wilmslow, was England's largest second-tier district by population until it disappeared in a 2009 reorganisation of Cheshire's local government.  This created Cheshire East council, which additionally includes towns like Congleton, Sandbach, Crewe and Nantwich.
</p><p>
Initially Cheshire East had a rather controversial Conservative majority, but the Tories lost control in 2019 and Labour have been running the council since then, currently at the head of a coalition with independent councillors.  The latest composition has 34 Conservatives, 28 Labour councillors plus this vacancy, 13 councillors in the independent group (several of whom were elected on localist tickets), and six ungrouped councillors.  They are a single Lib Dem, a defector from the Lib Dems to Reform UK, an ex-Conservative independent who succeeded future Reform UK MP Laura Pochin as councillor for Bunbury ward when she stood down in 2023, and three Smiths: John Smith whom readers may remember as the sane one in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgGmYeAm0jk"><em>that</em> notorious Handforth Parish Council video</a>, his wife Julie, and the former Labour MP for Crewe and Nantwich Laura Smith who is now listed by the council website as an Independent Socialist.  The Conservative total includes two by-election gains since the 2023 elections, one from Labour in Crewe Central and the other from the Residents of Wilmslow in Wilmslow Lacey Green ward.
</p><p>
Since its recreation in 2011 Macclesfield Central has generally been a Labour-inclined ward, although the Conservatives did take one of the two available seats in 2015.  In the two most recent Cheshire East elections the Green Party have run second here: they were quite close to winning a seat in 2019, but Labour pulled away in 2023 to beat the Greens by 54-22.
</p><p>
Unfortunately from Labour's point of view, this by-election has come out of the Councillors Behaving Badly file.  The outgoing councillor Ashley Farrall, who was first elected here in 2019, was arrested in November 2024 on suspicion of strangling his partner during a row at their home over a television programme.  In August 2025 a jury at Chester Crown Court found him not guilty of that charge, but convicted him of attempting to pervert the course of justice: following his arrest Farrall had repeatedly met with his partner in breach of his bail conditions, and they had discussed whether she would retract her witness statement.  Farrall resigned from Cheshire East council in September, just before he was sent to prison for 12 months.
</p><p>
Trying to pick up the pieces of this for Labour is their defending candidate James Barber-Chadwick, who is currently the deputy mayor of Macclesfield and represents this ward on Macclesfield town council: Barber-Chadwick is trying to return to Cheshire East council, where he represented Broken Cross and Upton ward from 2019 to 2023.  The Green Party have reselected John Knight who was runner-up here in 2023: Knight has stood in Macclesfield Central ward at every Cheshire East election from 2011 to date, and he was previously the Green candidate for Macclesfield at the 2010 general election and on the Green Party list for the North West at the 2014 European Parliament elections.  Also standing for Macclesfield Central are the Conservatives' Beverley Dooley who was previously a councillor here from 2015 to 2019; the Lib Dems' Stephen Broadhead who finished in sixth and last place here in 2023; Reform UK's Alan Miles who is fighting his first election campaign; and Kim Slater who is the first-ever election candidate for the Equality Party, a feminist movement founded by former activists for the now-defunct Women's Equality Party.

<h2>Quinton; and<br>
Salford Priors and Alcester Rural</h2>
</p><p>
<em>Stratford-on-Avon council, Warwickshire; caused respectively by the resignations of Liberal Democrat councillor Dominic Skinner and Conservative councillor Lauren Stanley.</em>
</p><p>
Our two Midlands polls today both fall in rural wards on the southern boundary of Warwickshire.  Here we find the northern end of the Cotswolds, whose National Landscape includes the Warwickshire villages of Ilmington and Upper Quinton; the Quinton ward extends north-east from here to take in the village of Lower Quinton.  This was the scene for the 1945 murder of Charles Walton, with local rumour having it that he had been ritually killed and that witchcraft was involved.  Despite the involvement of the Metropolitan Police officer DS Robert Fabian of the Yard as chief investigating officer, no-one was ever prosecuted for Walton's death and Warwickshire Constabulary class it as their oldest unsolved murder case.
</p><p>
Had Walton been killed fifteen years earlier his case might have ended up on the books of another police force.  Of the seven parishes which make up Quinton ward, only two - Atherstone on Stour and Ilmington - were historically part of Warwickshire.  And Ilmington formed part of an exclave of Warwickshire, which was cut off from the rest of the county by a salient of Gloucestershire (including Admington, Preston on Stour and Quinton parishes) and a detached part of Worcestershire which included Alderminster parish.
</p><p>
As can be appreciated from the above map of the county boundaries, all this formed a tangled mess which persisted even after most detached parts of English counties had been abolished in 1844.  It wasn't until 1931 that the present-day boundaries between Gloucestershire, Warwickshire and Worcestershire were settled and this whole area was placed within Warwickshire.
</p><p>
No such issues affect the area of Salford Priors and Alcester Rural ward, which has always been part of Warwickshire.  The village of Salford Priors lies in the Avon valley and is bypassed by the main road from Evesham to Alcester; the wider ward takes in five other parishes which together surround Alcester on three sides.
</p><p>
Included within the boundary is the stately home of Ragley Hall to the west of Alcester, which is available for weddings, events, filming and so on, together with an associated estate running to 6,000 acres.  All of this is owned by the Marquess of Hertford, and that remains the case following a legal case earlier this year.  The Marquess and the Marchioness have fallen out with their son and heir William Seymour, Earl of Yarmouth, who had been under the impression that he would take over management of the Ragley estate last year when he was 30; when this didn't happen he launched legal action to remove the estate trustees, but in May <a href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/ch/2025/1099">the High Court rejected this</a><!--[2025] EWHC 1099 (Ch)-->.  Media reports from earlier this month put Yarmouth's legal bill at £1.3 million, so Graham Moore might reflect that he got off lightly.
</p><p>
Elections in this corner of the world are run on lower budgets, and in recent years they have been dominated by the Liberal Democrats.  In 2024 the Stratford-on-Avon parliamentary seat failed to return the Conservative candidate for the first time since its re-creation in 1950: instead it was won easily by the Liberal Democrat candidate Manuella Perteghella, an Italian-born university lecturer.  She defeated the outgoing Conservative MP for Heywood and Middleton Chris Clarkson, who attempted to do the chicken run here after his slim majority in that seat had disappeared in boundary changes.  The Stratford Conservative nomination had become available at a late stage following the last-minute retirement of the former Chancellor of the Exchequer Nadhim Zahawi, who had been sacked from the Sunak cabinet for failing to disclose that he was under investigation by HMRC while he was Chancellor.
</p><p>
Perteghella had previously been the Stratford councillor for Welford-on-Avon ward, which bordered Quinton ward when she was first elected at a March 2020 by-election and now borders Salford Priors and Alcester Rural ward.  The Lib Dems gained overall control of Stratford-on-Avon council from the Conservatives in 2023, winning 25 seats to 12 Conservatives, 3 Greens and an independent.  Two subsequent by-elections in May 2025, in Welford-on-Avon (to replace Perteghella) and Alcester West wards, were both Lib Dem holds.  The three Warwickshire county divisions which cover parts of the wards up for election today were all Lib Dem gains from the Conservatives in May's county elections.
</p><p>
Quinton ward was part of the Lib Dem majority on Stratford-on-Avon council, but the result here was close in 2023 with Dominic Skinner winning just 29 votes ahead of the Conservatives; in percentage terms that was 44-41.  Salford Priors and Alcester Rural remained strongly in the Conservative column two years ago, with a 57-23 lead over the Lib Dems.  That ward's outgoing Conservative councillor Lauren Stanley cites personal reasons for her resignation, while the Lib Dems' Skinner - who was their parliamentary candidate for Stratford-on-Avon in 2019 - explains that he is having to devote more time to his role as an RAF reservist.
</p><p>
The Conservative defence in Salford Priors and Alcester Rural is led by Justin Kerridge, who was the Warwickshire county councillor for Studley from 2021 until he lost his seat to Reform UK in May.  In the 2023 Stratford-on-Avon elections he contested Studley North ward.  The Lib Dems have selected Huw Lewis, a former firefighter who runs a mechanic business in Bidford-on-Avon where he is a parish councillor.  Also standing here are Julie Fewins for Labour, Tom Genders for the Green Party and Reform UK's Ashley Jones, who stood in May for the county council in Alcester division (which covers all of this ward except Salford Priors) and in the Alcester West district council by-election.  Hopefully the election material from the candidates will promise better times ahead, on the grounds that Alcester has suffered enough.
</p><p>
In Quinton the Liberal Democrat defence is led by Paul Harrison, who is a professor at the University of Warwick specialising in particle physics.  The Conservative candidate Sarah Hession has a track record in local government: she sat on Bromsgrove council in Worcestershire from 2019 to 2023 representing Wythall East ward, and in May's county elections she stood in Alcester division.  The Green Party have selected Penny Stott, the Labour candidate is John Hartigan, and Reform UK's candidate is Quinton parish councillor Sean Edmunds: he stood in May's county elections for Stour and the Vale division, which covers nearly all of this ward.

<h2>Ashdown and Conquest</h2>
</p><p>
<em>East Sussex county council; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Peter Pragnell.</em>
</p><p>
We'll finish for the week in Sussex, on the northern edge of Hastings.  Travellers entering the town via the main A21 road from Tunbridge Wells will first encounter the Ashdown ward of Hastings, which covers a series of relatively upmarket suburbs along the Battle Road.  To the east of this is Conquest ward which is equally upmarket suburbia: this is centred on Conquest Hospital, which was opened in 1988 and is the main district general hospital for Hastings and its hinterland.  The hospital propels Conquest ward into the top 90 wards in England and Wales for residents employed in health and social care (23.75% of adults in employment).  Conquest ward also has Hastings' highest proportion of residents employed in higher managerial, administrative and professional occupations, with Ashdown ward close behind.
</p><p>
Hastings returns eight members of East Sussex county council, and its county divisions are simple pairings of the sixteen wards of Hastings council.  This had had a Labour majority since 2010, but in the 2022 Hastings elections Labour lost three seats to the Green Party and control of the council with it.  The Labour group then comprehensively split, and the Greens took over the council leadership in January 2024: this was confirmed by the 2024 election, in which the Green Party won nine wards to Labour's five and the Conservatives' two.  The Greens continue to run Hastings as a minority administration, currently with 12 seats against 9 Labour councillors, 6 ex-Labour independents and 5 Conservatives.
</p><p>
The two Hastings wards which the Conservatives held on to in May 2024 were Ashdown and Conquest wards, which form the basis for a very safe county division.  In 2021 the late Conservative county councillor Peter Pragnell enjoyed a 60-23 lead over Labour, and the only serious challenge to the Conservatives here in recent East Sussex elections came from UKIP in 2013.  The 2021 county elections were held at the height of the Boris Johnson COVID vaccine bounce, and by the May 2024 Hastings council elections the Tory vote here had been eroded: aggregating the votes cast in Ashdown and Conquest wards gives 38% for the Conservatives, 31% for Labour and 12% for the Green Party.
</p><p>
The Conservative position in the county council chamber has also been eroded.  The Tories won an overall majority on East Sussex county council in 2021 with 27 seats out of a possible 50, but by-election and defection losses have since tipped the Conservative administration into a minority with 22 seats plus this vacancy.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/e-sussex21s.svgz" alt="E Sussex CC, 2021" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
The whole of the borough of Hastings is contained in the Hastings and Rye parliamentary seat, which has been a bellwether since its creation in 1983.  Labour's Helena Dollimore, a former senior manager at Unilever, was so confident of success in 2024 that she resigned her seat on Merton council in London in advance of the election.  This gamble was rewarded, as Dollimore defeated the outgoing Conservative MP Sally-Ann Hart by 8,653 votes.  Back in 2017, Amber Rudd - who at the time was Home Secretary - had held on to the Hastings and Rye seat by just 346 votes.
</p><p>
The late Peter Pragnell, who was the last Conservative leader of Hastings council between 2006 and 2010, served as the county councillor for Ashdown and Conquest from 2009 until his death in September at the age of 65.  This came four years and four months into what was originally supposed to be a four-year term of office: the 2025 East Sussex elections were postponed pending local government reorganisation.  Pragnell had also been a Hastings councillor from 2000 until he lost his seat in St Helens ward in 2024.
</p><p>
Defending this seat for the Conservatives is Caroline Kerswell, a solicitor advocate and former barrister whose profile on the Hastings and Rye Conservatives website says she has "advised major financial institutions, fintech innovators and global regulators".  Kerswell has previously stood for Parliament twice as a Conservative candidate, contesting Wigan in 2015 and Luton North in 2017.  Labour have selected Amanda Pollard, who describes herself as an NHS whistleblower and healthcare campaigner.  Also on the ballot are the Lib Dems' Martin Griffiths who previously stood here in 2021, the Green Party's Paula Warne who is a Hastings councillor for Gensing ward and who is also endorsed by Hastings council's ex-Labour independent group, Reform UK's Adrian Fisher whose previous experience is in the financial sector and as a TA officer, and independent candidate Ricky Hodges who is standing on a right-wing ticket.
