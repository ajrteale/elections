"All the right votes, but not necessarily in the right order"
</blockquote>
</p><p>
Eight by-elections on 23rd October 2025, and we start with the big one:
</p><p>
<h2>Caerphilly</h2>
</p><p>
<em>Senedd Cymru; caused by the death of Labour MS Hefin David.</em>
</p><p>
It's time for us to consider what might well be the largest remaining UK poll of the year.  To do this we're going to head into the Welsh Valleys, into a town built by invaders.
</p><p>
Caerphilly is a Welsh-language name, as its Welsh spelling <em>Caerffili</em> makes clear.  <em>Caer</em> is a common prefix in Welsh placenames referring to a Roman fort, while it's not known who Ffili was.  Eleven centuries after the Romans had quit the fort, this area was being fought over between the Prince of Wales Llywelyn the Last and the English Marcher Lord "Red" Gilbert de Clare.  De Clare had made territorial gains in 1266 in the cantref of Senghenydd, and two years later he started to build a castle next to the old Roman fort to consolidate those gains.
</p><p>
Still representing the state of the art in 13th-century military design, Caerphilly Castle is the largest castle in Wales; in Britain, only Windsor is larger.  It was the first castle in Britain whose defences were in the form of concentric circles, while a series of artificial lakes discouraged attackers from getting too close.  It's now run by Cadw, the Welsh Government's heritage arm, as a tourist attration.
</p><p>
Much of what we see of Caerphilly Castle today is a restoration by two people called John Crichton-Stuart, respectively the 3rd and 4th Marquesses of Bute, who were extremely rich men.  But not even their riches could sort out the south-east tower, which leans outwards at a drunken angle of around 10 degrees from the vertical; opinions differ as to whether this is due to subsidence or a failed Civil War demolition attempt.
</p><p>
The castle spawned its own town to the south, on the northern slopes of Caerphilly Mountain which cuts the town off from Cardiff.  The main road going south from the town centre climbs steeply up to the top of the mountain, which has excellent views of the town.  The railway from Caerphilly to Cardiff, which is part of the Rhymney Line of the Valley Lines network, punches through the mountain in a tunnel.  There are six hourly trains from Caerphilly through that tunnel to Cardiff city centre and beyond, and the Rhymney Line is currently in the process of being electrified meaning that better trains are on the way.  St Martin's ward, which covers the town centre and the south-west of the town and includes Caerphilly and Aber railway stations, has a clear commuter economic profile.
</p><p>
There is still a lot of work to do to improve Lansbury Park, a 1960s council estate lying to the east of the castle, behind Morrison's supermarket.  Officially opened in 1965 by the Caerphilly MP Ness Edwards and consistently ranking among Wales' most deprived census districts, Lansbury Park is named after the former Labour Party leader George Lansbury and its housing courts are named after major Labour Party figures of yesteryear: Maxton Court, Snowden Court and so on.  You'd be hard-pressed to find a Labour Party poster in a window here right now, though.
</p><p>
Another former Labour MP commemorated in the town is Morgan Jones, who gives his name to Caerphilly's northern electoral ward and to a park north-west of the castle.  One recent addition to Morgan Jones Park is the Ukrainian Gratitude Orchard, a series of young fruit trees which have been planted here by the local Ukrainian refugee community.
</p><p>
While we're on the subject of famous sons and daughters of Caerphilly, we should mention the comedian and magician Tommy Cooper who has a statue in the town centre.  Cooper was born here in 1921.
</p><p>
In 1921, of course, coal was king in Caerphilly and in the Valleys as a whole.  The lower Rhymney valley and its western offshoot, the Aber valley, are full of towns and villages which developed in the late 19th or early 20th centuries around the pits.  This was a very dangerous job, and possibly nowhere suffered more than the village of Senghenydd at the head of the Aber valley.  On 14th October 1913 this was the site of Britain's worst-ever mining accident, a massive underground explosion in the Universal Colliery which killed 440 men, nearly all of whom lived in Senghenydd or down the valley at Abertridwr.  These villages have a combined modern population of around 6,000, which underlines what a devastating blow this was to the local community.  The centenary of the disaster was marked in 2013 by the opening of the Welsh National and Universal Mining Disaster Memorial Garden.  On my visit the memorial was lined with wreaths from another anniversary commemoration.
</p><p>
There are no active collieries in South Wales now.  The last deep mine in the Rhymney Valley was the Penallta Colliery up the valley at Hengoed, which closed in November 1991.  In 1935 Penallta had set a European record for coal wound in 24 hours.  The pithead buildings survive and have been turned into a business park.
</p><p>
Not far away from here we find Parc Penallta, the colliery's old spoil tip turned into a country park with some artworks.  Here we find the Observatory, which commands fine views over the Rhymney valley.
</p><p>
Meanwhile Sultan is one of the UK's largest artworks, a mound of earth in the shape of a pit pony 200 metres long and 15 metres high.  Sultan is so large he's difficult to photograph from the ground.
</p><p>
Parc Penallta overlooks the Tredomen business park outside Ystrad Mynach, which is dominated by the very 21st-century structure of Tŷ Penallta.  This building opened in 2008 and since then it has been the headquarters of Caerphilly council.
</p><p>
All this was once part of the Gelligaer urban district, which covers a series of pit villages on the west side of the Rhymney Valley.  The old UDC offices were located opposite Hengoed railway station - which was in fact two separate stations, the present Low Level station on the Rhymney Railway and the now-closed Hengoed High Level on the Taff Vale Extension railway.
</p><p>
The latter line crossed the Rhynmey valley on the impressive Hengoed Viaduct, which stands up to 120 feet above the valley floor.  It's now been restored for pedestrian and cycle traffic, linking Hengoed on the west side of the valley with Maesycwmmer on the east side.
</p><p>
Hengoed and Maesycwmmer are now both part of the Caerphilly council area, but they were once in different counties because the Rhymney was the boundary between Glamorgan and Monmouthshire.  They were also arguably in different countries, because Momouthshire's legal status was unclear: it was often counted as part of England, until the 1974 local government reforms settled the matter by declaring that county to be part of Wales.  References to Wales before 1974 were often made using the formula "Wales and Monmouthshire" to make clear which area was intended.
</p><p>
So perhaps it's appropriate that Bargoed, the northernmost town in the constituency, takes its name from the Welsh word for border or boundary, <em>bargod</em>.  This town clings to the steep western side of the Rhymney Valley, as can be seen from this photograph of the back of the library: the top floor of this building is in fact level with the main entrance, which is a converted chapel on the town's main street.  Bargoed has clearly had some money spent on it in recent years, and this large sculpture of colliery workers dominates the public space of Hanbury Square.

The census return for the Caerphilly constituency has some features which are often seen in the Valleys.  Aber Valley, the ward covering Senghenydd and Abertridwr, ranks 11th in England and Wales for residents who have no religion (63.4%) and three other wards in this constituency are in the top 100.  Three wards are in the top 100 for residents born in the UK, with Gilfach ward top at 98.1%.  Two wards are in the top 100 for long-term sickness and disability, with the highest figure of 10.9% being in Van ward (the ward which includes Lansbury Park).  St Cattwg ward, which covers Gelligaer village and Penpedairheol, is the in the top 100 wards in England and Wales for White British residents.  Immigration is not a major factor in the modern-day population of the Caerphilly constituency.

Things were very different on that score in 1885, when the coal industry was developing here and the population of Glamorgan was booming as people moved here for the jobs that the collieries could provide.  The county was a big winner from the 1885 redistribution which increased its representation from six MPs to 10: two for Merthyr Tydfil, two for the Swansea District of Boroughs, one for the Cardiff District of Boroughs and five for the rest of the county.  Caerphilly was placed within the single-member East Glamorganshire constituency, which covered the Glamorgan parts of the present Caerphilly seat plus the Taff valley to the west from Aberfan down to Tongwynlais.  This East Glamorganshire seat also had a detached part: the modern-day community of Rhigos at the head of the Cynon valley, which was cut off from the rest of the seat by the Merthyr Tydfil constituency.  Caerphilly and Pontypridd were the seat's largest towns.
</p><p>
This was a seat utterly dominated by the mining industry, but in 1885 the Labour Party did not exist and many working men (and all women) did not yet have the vote.  This meant that the East Glamorganshire seat was dominated by the Liberal Party throughout its existence, and in 1886 and 1895 the Liberals won the seat unopposed.  All but one of its elections were won by Sir Alfred Thomas, who had been mayor of Cardiff in 1881-82 and served as president of both the Baptist Union of Wales and the University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire, the predcessor to the modern Cardiff University.  Thomas led the Welsh Liberal parliamentary party for more than a decade, and the January 1910 <em>Times Guide to the House of Commons</em> noted that "his part in the national affairs of Wales has been conspicuous".
</p><p>
In 1900 the Conservatives put up Army officer Morgan Lindsay as their candidate for East Glamorganshire, despite the fact that Lindsay was away serving in the Boer War at the time.  Lindsay holds the record of being the first Welsh footballer to appear in the English FA Cup final, turning out for the Royal Engineers in the 1878 final at the Kennington Oval in London: his team lost 3-1 to the Wandereres, who won their third successive FA Cup.  After he retired from the Army Lindsay became a racehorse trainer, and he was the winning trainer at the 1926 and 1928 runnings of the Welsh Grand National.
</p><p>
Sir Alfred Thomas retired from the Commons in December 1910, although he was back in Parliament a couple of years later as the first and only Lord Pontypridd.  His retirement prompted a Labour candidate to stand, Charles Stanton, but without success as Thomas successfully passed East Glamorganshire on to the new Liberal candidate.  Clem Edwards was a barrister who specialised in trade union cases, including acting for the railway union in the notorious <em>Taff Vale</em> case of 1901.  He was making a quick return to Parliament, having previously served from 1906 to January 1910 for the Denbigh Boroughs - a seat which he had lost by just eight votes.
</p><p>
The 1918 redistribution split the East Glamorganshire seat up into two new seats called Caerphilly and Pontypridd, and the Caerphilly constituency has been little changed since then - either by the Boundary Commission or in terms of its politics.  By this point Clem Edwards had joined the short-lived National Democratic Party and he successfully sought re-election in East Ham South, leaving the way clear for Labour candidate Alfred Onions.  Onions was born into a Shropshire coalmining family and followed his father down the pit at the age of 10½, eventually moving to South Wales for work.  In 1891 he was the South Wales representative at the Paris congross of the Miners' International Federation; by the time he joined the Commons in 1918 he had become treasurer of the South Wales Miners' Federation and chairman of Monmouthshire county council.
</p><p>
Alfred Onions suddenly died in 1921, aged 62.  The resulting first Caerphilly by-election of 24th August 1921 returned Labour's Morgan Jones, the chairman of Gelligaer urban district council.  Jones was not from a mining background: he had worked as a teacher until 1916, when he lost his job after being imprisoned as a conscientious objector.  He was the first former conscientous objector to be returned to Parliament, and he ended up winning easily enough despite a high-profile campaign from the Communist Party of Great Britain which was fighting its first election.  The Communist candidate Bob Stewart ended up polling 10%, which under the rules at the time meant a lost deposit.
</p><p>
Morgan Jones went on to win seven terms of office as MP for Caerphilly, in the process seeing off future Conservative MPs Alan McLean (South West Norfolk 1923-29 and 1931-35), Gwilym Rowlands (Flintshire 1935-45) and Owen Temple-Morris (Cardiff East 1931-42).  Jones' support was such that his closest call was his first election in 1922 when he defeated McLean by 57-43; by contrast, in 1931 - which was a disaster for Labour nationally - the Conservatives' Catherine Bowen-Davies lost in Caerphilly by 68-32.  In Parliament Jones was a strong advocate for what we would now call devolution, and he served in the 1924 and 1929-31 Labour governments as Parliamentary secretary to the Board of Education.
</p><p>
Morgan Jones died in 1939 at the age of 53, from his third heart attack.  The resulting second Caerphilly by-election of 4th July 1939 easily returned Labour's Ness Edwards, who defeated the Conservatives' Ronald Bell by 68-32.  (Bell would go on to briefly serve as MP for Newport in 1945 before embarking in 1950 on a long career as a right-wing Conservative MP in Buckinghamshire.)  Like his predecessor, Ness Edwards had been imprisoned during the First World War as a conscientious objector; like many of his constituents he had worked down the coal pits, and at the time of the by-election he was an official in the Rhymney Valley district of the South Wales Miners' Federation.  He served in Attlee's second government as Postmaster-General.
</p><p>
One grisly relic of Ness Edwards' time in the Commons has recently come to light.  In April 1945 Edwards had visited the Buchenwald concentration camp as part of a parliamentary delegation, and as evidence of Nazi crimes he was given a fragment from a lampshade which had belonged to the camp commandant Karl-Otto Koch and his wife Ilse.  That lampshade had been made from human skin.  Edwards' daughter Llin Golding, who went on to serve as a Labour MP for Newcastle-under-Lyme from 1986 to 2001 and is now in the House of Lords, testified that her father couldn't face having this evidence of the Holocaust in his house and eventually gave it to his son to keep safe.  Earlier this year Edwards' granddaughter returned the lampshade fragment to Germany, where is is now in the collection of the memorial museum at Buchenwald.
</p><p>
Ness Edwards won eight terms of office as MP for Caerphilly before he died in 1968 at the age of 71.  The resulting third Caerphilly by-election of 15th July 1968 was held at a time when the Wilson government was very unopoular, and the Labour party had already lost five by-elections to the Conservatives that year.  Caerphilly nearly proved to be a sixth loss, but not to the Conservatives who lost their deposit.  Instead the challenge came from Plaid Cymru's Phil Williams, who had previously stood here in 1964 to little effect.  Williams had grown up in Bargoed and went on to become a professor of solar terrestrial physics at Aberystwyth.  He pulled off a swing of 29%, which cut the Labour majority from 21,148 down to just 1,874 votes.
</p><p>
Nonetheless a win is a win, and after this rocky start Fred Evans consolidated his position as Labour MP for Caerphilly.  Evans' previous career had been in education, and at the time of 1968 by-election he was headmaster at the Lewis Boys' School in Pengam, a prestigious institution which David Lloyd George had once described as "the Eton of the Valleys".  This school's former pupils included Phil Williams and Morgan Jones who have already been mentioned, plus the future Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock.  Evans went on to win four terms of office, defeating Plaid Cymru's Phil Williams on all four occasions.  (Williams did eventually achieve elected office, being elected to the first Welsh Assembly in 1999 as a regional member for South Wales East; shortly after his retirement in 2003, he suffered a fatal heart attack while visiting a Cardiff massage parlour.)
</p><p>
Fred Evans retired in 1983 and successfully passed the seat on to Ron Davies, who had started his political career early: in 1970, aged 24, Davies had become  Britain's youngest council leader by taking the top job at Machen urban district council.  He then became the first leader of Rhynmey Valley council following the 1974 reorganisation, before making it to the Commons in 1983.
</p><p>
In 1992 John Smith appointed Ron Davies as shadow Welsh secretary, and in that role Davies laid the foudations for Welsh devolution by agreeing plans for a 60-seat Assembly to be elected by proportional representation.  The plans for this were narrowly approved by the Welsh electorate in a September 1997 referendum, by a margin of 50.3% to 49.7%, and the following year Parliament passed the Government of Wales Act 1998 to give effect to devolution.  Davies had always been clear that "devolution is a process and not an event", and those words have been borne out: a subsequent referendum in 2011 on increased powers for the Assembly was passed easily, and the National Assembly for Wales is now Senedd Cymru, or the Welsh Parliament.
</p><p>
Ron Davies had piloted the Governemnt of Wales Act 1998 through Parliament as Welsh secretary, but he didn't get to lead the ongoing process of devolution himself.  Later in 1998 he became the first of Blair's Cabinet ministers to resign following a murky incident on Clapham Common in London which is still probably best described as a "moment of madness".  However, this didn't stop him being elected to the first Assembly in 1999, as the constituency member for Caerphilly, and he stood down from Westminster in 2001 to concentrate on his new role.
</p><p>
That new role didn't last long.  Shortly before the 2003 Assembly election Davies was forced to retire by his constituency party after the <em>Sun</em> published pictures of him at a gay sex haunt near the M4 motorway; Davies had initially denied he was there, then came up with an unbelievable story involving "watching badgers".  It's the coverup that gets you in the end.  Ron Davies then quit the Labour party but didn't leave elected politics: he stood in the 2004 European Parliament election on the Forward Wales list, then in the 2007 Assembly elections as an independent candidate for Caerphilly before being elected in 2008 to Caerphilly council as an independent councillor for his old local government stomping ground of Bedwas, Trethomas and Machen.  Davies subsequently joined Plaid Cymru, but this move didn't do him much good: he lost as the Plaid candidate for Caerphilly in the 2011 Assembly election, then lost his seat on Caerphilly council in 2012 and failed to get it back in a September 2015 by-election for Bedwas, Trethomas and Machen ward.  Since then our electoral services departments have heard no more of Ron Davies, but who knows what might happen in the future?  Maybe there's yet another comeback left in him yet...
</p><p>
The beneficiary of the implosion of Ron Davies' political career in 2003 was Jeffrey Cuthbert, who took over as the Labour AM for Caerphilly.  Cuthbert had started his career as an engineer in the mining industry before transitioning into education and training.  He went on to win three terms of office in the constituency, and in 2013 Cuthbert was appointed to the Welsh Cabinet as minister for communities and tackling poverty.
</p><p>
Jeffrey Cuthbert left the Assembly in 2016 to become Gwent police and crime commissioner, a position which he held for eight years.  He passed the Caerphilly seat on to Hefin David, who came to the Assembly from local government: David had been elected to Caerphilly council in a 2007 by-election for St Cattwg ward in Gelligaer, and he served on the council until 2017, rising to become chair of the policy and resources scrutiny committee.  He was re-elected to the renamed Senedd Cymru for a second term of office in 2021 with 46% of the vote, against 28% for Plaid Cymru's Delyth Jewell (who was re-elected as a regional MS for South Wales East and is now Plaid's deputy leader) and 17% for the Conservatives.
</p><p>
Hefin David was an academic who was working as a lecturer in HR development and practice at Cardiff Metropolitan University when he was elected in 2016.  His previous studies had been an undergraduate degree in politics and economics, a masters' degree in European policy and a PhD in small business employment issues.  With this background, as well as his experience bringing up an autistic daughter, it's not surprising that the Welsh Government thought he was a good person to draw up a report in 2023 on how to help young people with additional needs get into work.
</p><p>
On 12th August 2025, the day before his 48th birthday, Hefin David was found hanging at his home.  He leaves behind his partner Vikki Howells, who is the MS for Cynon Valley, and his two daughters.
</p><p>
Hefin David was not related to Sir Wayne David, who took over as MP for Caerphilly when Ron Davies stood down from the Commons in 2001.  Wayne David had a long political career which goes back to 1989 when he was elected as the MEP for South Wales, transferring to South Wales Central following boundary changes in 1994 when Wales was granted a fifth seat in the European Parliament.  Wayne had stood down as an MEP to seek election in the Rhondda constituency at the first Assembly election; he lost to Plaid Cymru on that occasion, but Caerphilly in 2001 proved to be a safer berth.  He retired at the 2024 Westminster election, at which Chris Evans, the outgoing MP for the neighbouring Islwyn seat which had disappeared in the boundary changes, successfully transferred to Caerphilly.  Vote shares last year in the Caerphilly Westminster seat, which is generally larger than the Senedd constituency and does not include Bargoed, were 38% for Labour, 21% for Plaid Cymru, 20% for Reform UK and 11% for the Conservatives.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2023/cheshire-w-chester23s.svgz" alt="CWAC, 2023" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
The most recent Welsh local elections were in 2022.  Caerphilly council has a strong Labour majority overall, with the 2022 elections returning 45 Labour councillors against 18 for Plaid Cymru and 6 independents.  However, if we restrict our analysis to the 13½ wards that cover the Caerphilly constituency we get a very different picture: all 18 Plaid councillors were elected from wards in this constituency, and Plaid Cymru actually beat Labour 18-15 in seats and 45-41 in votes across the area.  These figures include the whole of Aberbargoed and Bargoed ward, of which only Bargoed is in this seat; that ward had a by-election last August, in which Labour held off a Plaid Cymru challenge by just one vote.
</p><p>
This will be the last by-election to Senedd Cymru for the foreseeable future.  Electoral reform is coming to Wales next year: the Senedd will be expanded from 60 members to 96, and the Additional Member System is being scrapped in favour of a party list system.  Going forward, Wales will be divided into 16 constituencies each returning six MSs by proportional representation; casual vacancies are to be filled from the party list without a by-election, as currently happens for regional members of the Senedd.  The present Caerphilly constituency will be entirely subumed into a larger electoral area called Blaenau Gwent Caerffili Rhymni, which has a notional result from the 2024 Westminster election of 45% and 3 seats for Labour, 18% and 1 seat for Plaid Cymru, 12% and 1 seat for the Conservatives, and 11% and 1 seat for Reform UK.  These figures should probably be taken with a pinch of salt, partly because Westminster and devolved elections are fought on different issues and partly because last year Reform UK had no candidate in the Blaenau Gwent and Rhymney half of the electoral area.
</p><p>
As if all this wasn't spicy enough, Hefin David's suicide tipped Welsh Labour into a minority in the Senedd.  The latest composition has the Labour adminstration on 29 seats plus this vacancy, against 14 Conservatives, 12 Plaid Cymru MSs, 1 Lib Dem, 1 defector from the Conservatives to Reform UK and two independents (one elected for Plaid Cymru, the other for the Conservatives).
</p><p>
This is the context in which Richard Tunnicliffe is seeking to defend the Caerphilly Senedd by-election for Labour.  Tunnicliffe is the Ri in Rily Publications, a publisher of Welsh-language children's books which he runs with his wife Lynda.  He is standing for election for the first time, but politics in his blood: Richard's father Denis Tunnicliffe has been a Labour member of the House of Lords since 2004, with the title Lord Tunnicliffe, and was leader of the Labour group on Bracknell Forest council in Berkshire in the 1980s.  Tunnicliffe's campaign got off to a rocky start when the Labour leader of Caerphilly council quit the party last month and endorsed Plaid Cymru.
</p><p>
Which brings us to Plaid, whose choice of candidate was an obvious one.  Lindsay Whittle has been the Plaid Cymru candidate for Caerphilly at nearly every Westminster and Senedd election in a sequence going back all the way to 1983: he has never won the seat as such, but he did serve in the Welsh Assembly in 2011-16 as a regional AM for South Wales East.  Whittle has served continuously since 1976 as a councillor for Penyrheol ward in north-western Caerphilly town, he has had two terms as leader of Caerphilly council (1999-2004 and 2008-11), and he is currently the leader of the opposition Plaid Cymru group on the council.
</p><p>
The Conservatives have never won the Caerphilly constituency at either Westminster or Senedd level, and that record doesn't look likely to be broken now.  Hoping to prove me wrong on that is Gareth Potter, a party staffer who has previously worked in the retail and charity sectors.
</p><p>
No other candidates saved their deposit here in 2021.  Fourth on that occasion with 3.9% was the anachronistically-named Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party, who are not trying again.  The Lib Dems have reselected Steve Aicheler, who finished in fifth place four years ago on 2.7%; Aicheler subsequently came closer to saving his deposit in the 2024 general election.  In the 2022 Caerphilly elections Aicheler was runner-up in Machen and Rudry ward, which was the only ward within this constituency that the Lib Dems contested, and he was elected to Bedwas, Trethomas and Machen community council.  For Reform UK the only way is up after they finished in sixth and last place in 2021 with 1.7% of the vote: they have selected Llŷr Powell, a communications specialist who is fighting his first election campaign.  Powell has previously worked for the disgraced Reform UK Wales leader Nathen Gill, who pleaded guilty during the campaign to accepting bribes to make pro-Russian statements in the European Parliament.
</p><p>

</p><p>
Overall we have an all-male ballot paper of eight candidates, with three new parties trying their luck.  Gwlad, a party which campaigns for Welsh independence, have selected Anthony Cook who is an Army veteran from Ystrad Mynach.  The Wales Green Party candidate is Gareth Hughes, who is retired after a career in political journalism which included over ten years as a political commentator for ITV Wales.  And trying his luck from his home over the border in faraway Hampshire is 22-year-old Roger Quilliam, standing for the UK Independence Party on a "Scrap the Senedd" ticket.
</p><p>
At the time of writing one opinion poll of the constituency had been attempted, carried out by Survation for the Cardiff-based PR consultancy Camlas: this had Powell (RUK) in the lead on 42%, narrowly ahead of Whittle (PC) on 38%, with Tunnicliffe (Lab) a long way back on 12%.  Constituency polling in the UK, of course, has a very mixed track record.  On my research trip, the completely unscientific metric of counting posters and stakeboards also showed a close Plaid Cymru versus Reform UK race, with Reform UK light blue particularly strong in Caerphilly town.  We'll know for sure, of course, once the votes tumble out of the ballot boxes onto the counting tables.  This by-election is being carried out on the Welsh local government franchise, so Votes at 16 apply and anybody, whatever their nationality, who is legally resident in the constituency is eligible to vote.  The winner will have the chance to try and resolve some of what they think Caerphilly's problems are; the losers may well end up being pilloried for their performance, but hopefully that process won't involve an actual pillory.

<h2>Moseley</h2>
</p><p>
<em>Birmingham council, West Midlands; caused by the death of Labour councillor Kerry Jenkins.</em>
</p><p>
On the undercard to today's Senedd by-election we have seven local by-elections taking place in England with a decent political spread: the Conservatives and Labour are defending two seats each, and there are also seats held by the Lib Dems and an independent, plus a free-for-all.  We'll start in the big bankrupt city of Birmingham, whose city council will be the biggest single prize in next year's English local government elections when all of its 101 members come up for re-election.
</p><p>
Probably the last Birmingham election of this strike-hit council term occurs in Moseley, a suburb to the south of the city centre.  Moseley was described in 2015 by the <em>Sunday Times</em> as the "best urban place to live", with the newspaper noting its Victorian architecture and Bohemian culture.  The Bohemian culture is not a reference to immigration from central Europe, as the ward's census return makes clear, but to a certain urban middle-class lifestyle chiefly associated with the Moseley Village area.  This is the sort of place where the locals protested against plans for a Tesco and eventually get it upgraded - not just to any supermarket, but to a Marks and Spencer supermarket - and the howls of anguish when Greggs opened a Moseley branch last year were apparently something to behold.
</p><p>
Moseley's housing stock is full of large Edwardian houses which would have needed at least one servant to run when they were originally built; but the middle classes can't afford that sort of lifestyle, and most of the houses have been subdivided into flats.  Almost half of Moseley ward's households are now flats or apartments.  It should also be pointed out that Moseley Village is not typical of the wider ward, which includes some heavily working class areas; the north of the ward also has a large South Asian population.  Overall Moseley ward's population is 35% Asian and 34% Muslim; it has the West Midlands' third-highest Jewish population (although this only amounts to 121 people or 0.6% of the total) and it makes the top 60 wards in England and Wales for residents who identify only as British, which is a common feature of wards with large South Asian Muslim communities.
</p><p>
The present Moseley ward stretches from Cannon Hill Park and Highbury Park in the west to Moseley Bog in the east, a nature reserve which was apparently an inspiration for the landscape of Middle-Earth: J R R Tolkein grew up in Moseley.  The largest single employer here is probably Moseley Hall Hospital, a minor NHS unit which incorporates the Grade II-listed former country house of Moseley Hall.
</p><p>
Moseley was once seen as important enough to be the centre of its own parliamentary constituency, which existed from 1918 to 1950.  Birmingham Moseley was a Conservative and Unionist seat which for all but three years of its existence was represented by Sir Patrick Hannon, an Irishman who had come to politics from a career in agriculture.  Hannon had very large majorities in every election except in 1945, by which point by the Chamberlain political machine which had had an iron grip on Birmingham's politics for much of the early 20th century was running out of steam.  Joseph Chamberlain himself had his residence within the ward at Highbury Hall, which is now run by the council as a conference centre.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2022/birmingham22s.svgz" alt="Birmingham, 2022" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Conservatism is no longer a feature of Moseley's politics, and in this century the modern Moseley ward (and its predecessor, Moseley and Kings Heath) has been fought over between Labour and the Liberal Democrats.  The most recent election here in 2022 saw the ward split its two seats, with topline vote shares of 47% for the Lib Dems and 39% for Labour.  The Lib Dems' Izzy Knowles topped the poll with over 3,000 votes and clearly had a large personal vote: her running-mate scored only just over half that.
</p><p>
Modern Parliamentary elections here have a very different pattern.  The name of Moseley was restored to the constituency map in 2024 when the local seat of Birmingham Hall Green was renamed as Birmingham Hall Green and Moseley.  This seat includes two of the ten most Muslim wards in England and Wales, with Sparkhill and Sparkbrook/Balsall Heath East both being over 77% Muslim; by contrast the figure for Moseley ward is just 34% as already stated.  As such the Birmingham Hall Green and Moseley seat is dominated by the politics of that community, and in 2024 its first-term Labour incumbent Tahir Ali lost over half of his vote while still winning comfortably enough against split opposition from two independent candidates.
</p><p>
This may well be the last Birmingham by-election of a city council term which started with the celebration of the Commonwealth Games but which has been marked by the council's bankruptcy, large council tax rises and a long and damaging strike by the city's binmen.  It is defended by Labour and is to replace Kerry Jenkins, who died at the end of July at the age of 62.  Jenkins had been a city councillor for eleven years: she was first elected in 2014 for Hall Green ward, and transferred here in 2018 following boundary changes.
</p><p>
Defending this seat for Labour is Stephen Pihlaja, an American-born academic at Aston University: he is decribed by the University as "a linguist and discourse analyst who teaches and researches language use in interaction around religious issues", and he has written several books on that subject.  The Liberal Democrats have selected Philip Mills, who hasn't let his blindness stop him from working as the finance director for a national charity.  Also on the ballot are Catherine Turner for the Green Party, Nayaz Qazi for the Conservatives, Aysan al-Haq for Reform UK, Danny Mazhar for a new party called the Birmingham Community Independents, and left-wing independent candidate Carol Williams.

<h2>Whittlesey North West</h2>
</p><p>
<em>Fenland council, Cambridgeshire; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Elisabeth Sennitt Clough.</em>
</p><p>
Now for something completely different, as we travel into the fens of East Anglia.  He were find the market town of Whittlesey, which lies around six miles east of Peterborough: the -ey suffix of the name refers to an island of dry ground above the marshes.  This island is slowly being whittled away for industry, as the western end of Whittlesey North West ward is dominated by a large brickworks and a series of flooded pits from which the clay was extracted to make the bricks.  Also here is a large factory operated by McCain Foods which makes frozen chips.  The housing in this ward lies either side of Stonald Road, whose arrow-straight alignment shows that this is an old Roman road: modern-day Stonald Road was once part of the Fen Causeway, a road across the marshes which linked modern-day Peterborough with Norfolk.
</p><p>
The ward boundaries in Fenland have changed since the 2021 census was taken.  Whittlesey North West is an expanded version of the former Stonald ward, which made the top 60 wards in England and Wales for adults with level 2 qualifications (5+ GCSE passes or equivalent).
</p><p>
Fenland council has been under Conservative control since 2023, and the opposition parties are very poorly organised here.  Notoriously, in the 2007 election the Conservatives won eighteen of the council's then forty seats unopposed before a single vote was cast.  We did see a contest for every seat in 2023, when new ward boundaries came in: on that occasion the Conservatives bucked the national trend and increased their majority, winning 35 seats against 6 independents and two Lib Dems.
</p><p>
The North East Cambridgeshire parliamentary seat, which covers a slightly larger area than Fenland district, also continues to be very safe Conservative at Parliamentary level.  Since 2010 this has been the seat of Steve Barclay, who served in the Johnson and Sunak cabinets as health and then environment secretary.  Barclay now chairs the Commons finance committee.
</p><p>
Whittlesey North West is part of the Conservative majority on Fenland council, with topline vote shares here in May 2023 being 57% for the Conservatives and 22% for Labour.  In May's Cambridgeshire county elections the Conservatives also easily held the Whittlesey North county division, whose county councillor is the district council leader Chris Boden.
</p><p>
The outgoing Conservative councillor here is Elisabeth Sennitt Clough, who is described as an award-winning poet and had first been elected in 2023.  She was also elected to Whittlesey town council, which has seen a wave of resignations recently amid claims of bullying by some Conservative figures.  Sennit Clough has joined the exodus: she resigned both her town and district council seats and quit the Conservative party in September, writing on social media that "If I wanted to work in a playground, I would work in a nursery. I refuse to waste any more of my time working with clowns with crayons."
</p><p>
Defending this seat for the Conservatives is Alec Branton.  Labour have selected Theresa Okogwa, who is a registered nurse and a qualified solicitor.  Martin Curtis, who has previously been a Conservative leader of Cambridgeshire county council and also appeared on <em>Countdown</em> in 2021, is standing as an independent candidate after finishing a close second in a by-election for another Whittlesey ward last year, while Reform UK have nominated Kevin Marston who was runner-up in Whittlesey North is May's county council elections.

<h2>New Town and Christ Church</h2>
</p><p>
<em>Colchester council, Essex; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Pam Cox.</em>
</p><p>
We now come to England's newest and oldest city.  Camulodunum is the UK's oldest recorded town, being conquered by the Romans in AD 43 and having been the seat before then of the legendary king Cunobelin or Cymbeline; but its city status dates only from 2022, awarded as part of the Platinum Jubilee of Elizabeth II.  Excavations in 2004 identified a Roman circus where chariot races were held, the only known example of this in Britain; its site, which was previously part of the Colchester Garrison, is currently slated for redevelopment.
</p><p>
The Circus was in what is now New Town and Christ Church ward, which lies to the south of the town centre and to the north of the Garrison.  The New Town area is in the east, next to the railway terminus at Colchester Town; while Christ Church lies in the west of the ward.  In the middle is the Abbey Field, which includes the Garrison's athletics track, football and cricket pitches.
</p><p>
New Town and Christ Church has some University of Essex students living here, which may account for the blowout Labour win in 2024 in a ward which has often returned Liberal Democrat councillors in the past.  The Labour candidate here last year was Pam Cox, a professor of social history and criminology at the University of Essex who has previously presented history documentaries for the BBC and other broadcasters.  Cox was re-elected for her second term on the city council with a 57-16 lead over the Conservatives.
</p><p>
By this point Cox had already been selected as Labour's parliamentary candidate for Colchester at the next general election.  This was an open seat following the retirement of Conservative MP Will Quince, who had defeated the previous Lib Dem MP Bob Russell in 2015.  (Russell had served in the Commons since 1997, and he had represented the old New Town ward on Colchester council for decades before that.)  Labour had moved into a clear second place in the Colchester constitunecy, and despite the Conservatives putting up a celebrity candidate - the former Olympic rower James Cracknell - Cox ended up winning easily to become Colchester's first Labour MP since 1945.  She has now stood down from Colchester council to focus on her Westminster duties.  Cracknell, meanwhile, was an unsuccessful candidate for Oxfordshire county council in May: appropriately enough, he contested Henley.
</p><p>
In Essex county council elections this ward is divided between the Abbey division (safe Labour in 2021) and the Drury division (safe Conservative).  The unsuccessful Labour candidate for Drury in 2021 was Richard Bourne, who is the defending Labour candidate in this New Town and Christ Church by-election: Bourne has previously had a long career as an NHS manager.  The Conservatives have selected Angus Allan, who has started and run several businesses in the city.  Also on the ballot are Chantelle Whyborn for the Lib Dems, Alex McCormick for the Green Party, independent candidate Ian Partridge who finished in fifth and last place here in 2024, and Reform UK's James Child.

<h2>Paulsgrove</h2>
</p><p>
<em>Portsmouth council, Hampshire; caused by the resignation of Portsmouth Independent Party candidate Brian Madgwick.</em>
</p><p>
Andrew's Previews has been going in some form or another since September 2010, and in the 15 years and one month since then we have covered all but one of Great Britain's local government districts.  Today is the day that we complete the set with a visit to the south coast.  Let's go to Portsmouth, which is holding its first by-election since February 2008.  Maybe some other councils could learn lessons from Portsmouth on how to keep hold of their councillors, because the city council must have been doing something right.
</p><p>
Most of the city of Portsmouth lies on Portsea Island, which is bordered by the Solent to the south, Portsmouth Harbour to the west, Langstone Harbour to the east and the narrow Port Creek to the north.  Portsea Island is so densely populated that it ranks as the third-largest of the British Isles by population, behind only Great Britain and Ireland and just ahead of the Isle of Wight.  With no room on the island to grow, the city has had to expand onto the mainland just to the north of the Port Creek, but there's not much flat ground here before the steep escarpment of Portsdown Hill is reached.  All communication links between Portsmouth and the outside world - the M27 motorway, the railway and other roads - have to pass through this narrow coastal strip of land.
</p><p>
Here we find Paulsgrove in the north-west corner of the city.  This mostly consists of a large housing estate built by the city council in the late 1940s and 1950s to replace bombed-out housing on the island; when the houses were built a strip of land was left vacant through which the M27 motorway was later threaded.  There are a number of military facilities here, both on top of Portsdown Hill and down below on the former Horsea Island, which has been joined to the mainland by land reclamation and where the Royal Navy run a diving school.  Next to this on the reclaimed land is a former landfill site which has been turned into the Horsea Island Country Park, and a large civilian marina called Port Solent.  The Portsmouth city boundary includes all of Portsmouth Harbour up to the high-water mark on the Portchester and Gosport coasts, and most of this seawater is within Paulsgrove ward - which consequently has a very strange shape.
</p><p>
This working-class council-estate ward hit the headlines in the summer of 2000 for all the wrong reasons, with a series of riots over several nights directed at suspected paedophiles.  Paulsgrove has struggled to live that down ever since.
</p><p>
Portsmouth city ouncil has been under No Overall Control for over a decade now, with the Liberal Democrats having run a minority administration since 2018.  They're not relevant in Paulsgrove which had historically been a close fight between Labour and the Conservatives - with a UKIP win in 2014 for good measure.  However, things changed here in 2021 with the election of George Madgwick as an independent councillor in a landslide result.  Madgwick then formed the Portsmouth Independents Party, a localist group which went on to win several more seats across the city in the following years - at their height, there were 9 PIP councillors out of 42 on the council.  The PIP won Paulsgrove very comfortably in 2022, 2023 and 2024; on the latter occasion George Madgwick was re-elected for his second term of office with a 64-15 lead over the Conservatives.
</p><p>
The Labour versus Conservative dynamic is still seen at Parliamentary level, where the Portsmouth North constituency is a bellwether marginal which has voted for the government at every election since its creation in February 1974.  Its current Labour MP, Amanda Martin, narrowly defeated the Leader of the House of Commons Penny Mordaunt in 2024.
</p><p>
This Paulgrove by-election is to replace George Madgwick's father Brian Madgwick, who stood down on health grounds last month.  Brian was due for re-election in 2026, so whoever wins this poll won't be able to rest for long.  His son defected to Reform UK last year, and five other PIP councillors have now joined him.   This means that the latest council composition has 19 Lib Dems against 9 Labour councillors, 6 for Reform UK, 4 Conservatives, 2 remaining PIP councillors, an independent and this vacancy.
</p><p>
There is no defending Portsmouth Independent Party candidate in this by-election.  We have a free-for-all, I repeat we have a free-for-all!  Effectively the new Madgwickite candidate is Joe Standen, who is standing for Reform UK: he is a former Royal Marines commando who now works as a fundraiser for the Royal Navy and Royal Marines Charity, and he was an unsuccessful Conservative candidate elsewhere in the city in the 2023 and 2024 Portsmouth elections.  The Conservatives have reselected Thomas Hoare, a qualified early years educator who was a distant runner-up here last year.  Also standing are Labour's Sydna Phillips, who is the daughter of the 1997-2005 Labour MP for Portsmouth North Syd Rapson; the Greens' Georgina Ayling; and the Liberal Democrats' Michelle Simmons.

<h2>Dunster; and<br>
Glastonbury</h2>
</p><p>
<em>Somerset council; caused respectively by the rsignation of Conservative councillor Christine Lawrence and by the death of Liberal Democrat councillor Nick Cottle.</em>
</p><p>
Our remaining three polls today are all in the West Country, and we have two polls to the newish Somerset council which cover very different areas.  One is the town of Glastonbury, which can be found in the Somerset Levels on the slopes of Glastonbury Tor.  Glastonbury Abbey, which now lies in ruins, goes back to the eighth century and the town has become a focal point for all sorts of other religions, particularly of the New Age variety: in the 2021 census Glastonbury ward, which has the same boundaries as the town, ranked 6th in England and Wales for "other" religions at 5.4%.
<!--(The wards above it are two wards in Enfield with a large Druze population; two wards in Kenton with a large Jain population; and Crowborough South East which is the site of a large Scientology centre.)-->
</p><p>
This column previously visited Dunster in February 2017 to cover one of the last by-elections to West Somerset council, which disappeared in 2019; its successor Somerset West and Taunton council then lasted for only four years before it was itself reorganised out of existence.  Dunster itself is a well-preserved mediaeval village on the edge of the Exmoor National Park at the mouth of the River Avill.  Dunster Castle and St George's Priory Church, both of which contain 13th-century work, are both Grade I listed, while the 14th-century Dunster Tithe Barn - one of the polling stations for this by-election - was recorded at the Dissolution in 1535 as having a net annual income of £37 4s 8d.  Six centuries of inflation means that the poll clerk today will probably get two or three times that.  The wool trade was important to Dunster in mediaeval times, but these days tourism is the only game in town, with the above attractions joined by a doll museum and the preserved West Somerset Railway, which passes through on the way to Minehead.  Overlooking the village is Grabbist Hill, which before its forestation was covered with heather and said to be the inspiration for the purple-headed mountain in the hymn <em>All Things Bright and Beautiful</em>.  The present Dunster ward contains nine other parishes to the south-east of Dunster, running as far as Crowcombe off the main road towards Taunton, plus the south-eastern quarter of Minehead which is by far the largest single polling district in this ward.

Both Dunster and Glastonbury wards split their representation between the Conservatives and the Lib Dems at the first, and so far only, Somerset council elections in 2022.  Topline vote shares in Dunster were 42% for the Conservatives and 41% for the Lib Dems, while Glastonbury gave 38% to the Lib Dems (much of which was a personal vote for Nick Cottle), 31% to the Conservatives and 25% to the Green Pary.  The 2022 Somerset council wards are with one exception descended unaltered from the previous county council divisions, and in 2013 and 2017 Dunster was safely Conservative.  Glastonbury was the exception, because the old Somerset council boundaries had a two-seat division combining Glastonbury with the nearby town of Street; looking at previous results for Mendip council suggests that the former division's Lib Dem vote was concentrated in Street, so despite its New Age reputation Glastonbury may well have voted Conservative in those years too.
</p><p>
Both of these wards were affected by last year's parliamentary boundary changes, which saw the Somerton and Frome constituency split into two with major knock-on effects throughout Somerset.  Glastonbury ended up moving from the Wells contituency into the seat of Glastonbury and Somerton, which is one of the two successors to Somerton and Frome: the Lib Dems' Sarah Dyke won the by-election to the old Somerton and Frome seat in 2023 and transferred to Glastonbury and Somerton in 2024.  Dyke was recently promoted to the Lib Dems' frontbench as their rural affairs spokeswoman.
</p><p>
The 2024 boundary changes also transferred Dunster out of its previous Bridgwater and West Somerset constituency into a new seat called Tiverton and Minehead which crosses the Somerset and Devon boundary.  The previous Bridgwater and West Somerset Conservative MP Ian Liddell-Grainger decided to stand here, but he went down to defeat as the seat was won by the Lib Dems' Rachel Gilmour.  Ironically, the redrawn Bridgwater seat remained in Conservative hands.
</p><p>
The Dunster by-election is defended by the Conservatives following the retirement of Christine Lawrence, who had represented this area on the county council for 24 years.  Lawrence also sat on the old West Somerset council from 1999 to 2011, representing Minehead North.  I have checked the records and I can confirm that Mr Hilter was not one of her colleagues.

</p><p>
Defending this seat for the Conservatives is James Bellamy, who runs a fish and chip shop in Minehead.  The Lib Dem candidate Cara Strom is a pub landlady who runs the Anchors Drop in the village of Blue Anchor; she is an Old Cleeve parish councillor, and she is the partner of Dunster ward's present Lib Dem councillor Marcus Kravis.  Terry Ledlie for Labour and Jonathan Rollason for Reform UK complete the Dunster ballot paper.
</p><p>
The Glastonbury by-election is to replace another long-serving councillor, Nick Cottle, who died in August at the age of 68.  Cottle was first elected to Glastonbury town council in 1999 and had served as mayor of the town.  In May 2007 he was elected to Mendip council as a councillor for Glastonbury St Edmund's ward, but he then resigned pretty much straight away due to an unexpected change in his personal circumstances, and the resulting by-election in September 2007 was lost back to the Conservatives.  Cottle then got his seat back in 2011 and served until Mendip council was abolished in 2023, latterly as that council's deputy leader.
</p><p>
Here the defending Lib Dem candidate, who will be hoping to pick up Cottle's large personal vote, is Ewan Cameron.  The Conservatives have reselected Lilli Osborn who was their losing candidate here in 2022; she is a Glastonbury town councillor, care worker and independent mental capacity advocate.  Another Glastonbury town councillor on the ballot is the Greens' Jon Cousins, who has served four times as mayor of the town and also represented Glastonbury St John's ward on Mendip council from 2019 to 2023.  Labour's Gregory Chambers and Reform UK's Henry Warne complete this ballot.

<h2>Milton and Tamarside</h2>
</p><p>
<em>Torridge council, Devon; caused by the resignation of independent councillor Christopher Hepple.</em>
</p><p>
We'll finish for the week with our independent defence on the western edge of Devon.   Milton and Tamarside ward has a curious shape, in that it entirely surrounds the town of Holsworthy which forms a separate ward of its own.  The Milton of this ward name is Milton Damerel, a village with a population of around 450 off the road from Holsworthy to Bideford.
</p><p>
Milton Damarel's population places it only around fourth of the nine parishes in this ward.  The largest single centre of population within the ward boundary appears to be Pyworthy, a village which lies a few miles west of Holsworthy.  Also larger than Milton Damerel is Bridgerule, which is the only significant Devon settlement to lie west of the River Tamar.  Until this ward was created in 2019, Bridgerule and Pyworthy were the main settlements in a single-member Tamarside ward.  There are a number of solar farms here, particularly in the Pyworthy area, which are doing their bit for Devon's electricity generation; and there are plans for more.
</p><p>
The 2021 census underlines how remote this area is.  Milton and Tamarside ward made the top 30 wards in England and Wales for residents working in the agriculture sector (16.8%), the top 40 wards for small employers and own-account workers (26.4%) and the top 80 for self-employment (19.7%).  It was also in the top 100 wards for the 45-64 age bracket (34.1%) and for detached housing (72.8% of households).
</p><p>
Another indication of Milton and Tamarside ward's remoteness is that its first election in 2019 was uncontested: the Conservatives' Kit Hepple and independent candidate Ken James were the only candidates nominated for the two seats, so they were declared elected unopposed.  James and Hepple were re-elected in 2023, but this time Hepple was standing as an independent candidate without Conservative opposition.  Topline vote shares were 52% for the James/Hepple slate and 30% for the Green Party candidate.  Torridge council is under no overall control, with the independent group currently in first place and running the council as a minority: the latest count had 12 independents plus this vacancy against 10 Lib Dems, 5 Conservatives plus another vacancy, 3 Greens, 2 Labour and 2 non-aligned councillors.
</p><p>
There were no independent candidates here in the 2025 Devon county council elections, in which the Conservatives lost the Holworthy Rural division to Reform UK whose candidate finished just ahead of the Lib Dems.  The ward has been represented in Parliament for over 20 years by the former Attorney General Sir Geoffrey Cox, currently as part of the Torridge and Tavistock constituency.
</p><p>
These previous results give us some decidedly mixed messages in the by-election to replace independent councillor Kit Hepple following his resignation.  One new independent candidate has come forward: that's Mark Marriott, who runs a holiday cottage business in Pyworthy.  The Greens' Tracey Beresford, who runs holiday accommodation near the village of Pancrasweek within the ward, is back for another go after finishing as runner-up here in the 2023 Torridge elections and in fourth place at May's Devon county elections.  Also on the ballot are candidates from three parties which didn't stand here in 2023: Nigel Kenneally for the Lib Dems (a Holsworthy town councillor who was a close runner-up in May's county election), John Watson for Reform UK (fighting his first election campaign) and Evan Williams for the Conservatives (who is a parish councillor in St Giles on the Heath, a village some miles to the south near Launceston).
</p><p>
That's all for this week's local by-elections, but Andrew's Previews hasn't finished with this week yet: tomorrow a special guest post will be coming out.  Stay tuned for that.
