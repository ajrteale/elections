Eight by-elections, for nine seats, on 21st August 2025:

<h2>Addlestone</h2>

Surrey county council; and

<h2>Addlestone South</h2>

Runnymede council, Surrey.  The county by-election follows the death of John Furey; the district by-election is for two seats following the death of Furey and the resignation of Peter Snow.  Both were Conservative councillors.

It's pretty rare that we get a busy by-election week in August, which is not a popular time for by-election campaigning thanks to those pesky little things called school holidays.  There are just 14 council by-elections taking place over four Thursdays this month, but by some quirk of randomness eight of them have been scheduled for today.  The last time Andrew's Previews had an August day this busy was back in 2016.

In numerical terms the biggest prize here is in Addlestone

<h2>Alton Amery</h2>

East Hampshire council; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Steve Hunt.

If I disappointed you with the Cranford in the previous section not being the literary one, we are on slightly firmer ground with the Hampshire town of Alton which is strongly associated with Jane Austen; her former home at Chawton lies just south of the town.  Within Alton itself we find a plaque on an old buliding on Amery Street, which states that the Elizabethan poet Edmund Spenser once lived there in 1590 (the year that <em>The Faerie Queene</em> was published); however, it's fair to say that there is no documentary evidence to support this.

Amery Street leads uphill from the town centre to Amery Hill School, a secondary school with academy status located in the north of the town; its former pupils include Matthew Offord, who went on to serve from 2010 to 2024 as Conservative MP for Hendon, and the dance musician Alison Goldfrapp.  Beyond the school we find Alton Amery ward, which covers housing on the north-western fringe of the town.

Alton is the largest town in the East Hampshire local government district, which is run by a coalition of the Conservatives and the Whitehill and Bordon Community Party after the Tories lost their majority in the 2023 election.  That poll returned 19 Conservatives, 14 Lib Dems, 6 members of the Whitehill and Bordon Community Party, 2 Greens, 1 Labour and 1 independent councillor; last year the Lib Dems successfully defended a by-election in Four Marks and Medstead ward, which lies to the south-west of Alton and includes Chawton.

Alton Amery ward has been in the Lib Dem column since the current ward boundaries were introduced in 2019; in 2023 the outgoing councillor Steve Hunt, who led the Lib Dem opposition on the council at the time, was re-elected with a 53-29 lead over the Conservatives.  Hunt had previously narrowly failed to be elected to Hampshire county council at its last election in 2021, when the Conservatives held the Alton Town division by less than 100 votes.  There was also a Lib Dem near-miss in 2024 in the East Hampshire parliamentary seat which includes Alton: the Conservative former education secretary Damian Hinds was re-elected for his fifth term of office with a majority of 1,275 votes.

The Liberal Democrats will have to defend this by-election following Hunt's resignation, and they have selected Lizzie Marshall who teaches nursing and health and social care.  She is fighting her first election campaign as is the wonderfully-named Conservative candidate Brighton Gono, a Zimbabwean by birth whose career has taken him to Alton via Australia.  The only other candidate is Richard Moore who is hoping to become East Hampshire's first Reform UK councillor.

<h2>Abermaw</h2>

Gwynedd council, Wales; caused by the death of independent councillor Rob Triggs.

For our Welsh by-election it's time to come to a proper holiday resort, in this school holiday month.  And don't just take my word for it that Barmouth, on the western coast of Wales, is a nice place.  Wordsworth had nice words for Barmouth in the early 19th century, and it features prominently as a location in the 2001 novel <em>Austerlitz</em>, by the German writer W G Sebald.  <em>Austerlitz</em>' protagonist grew up here, as did the jazz musician and music journalist Russell Davies who since 2010 has been the permanent host of the Radio 4 quiz <em>Brain of Britain</em>.

The English-language name "Barmouth" might be suggestive of the town's location at the mouth of an estuary; but if you thought that you've got it the wrong way round.  This is in fact an Anglicisation of the Welsh name <em>Abermawddach</em>, with the "mouth" referring to the name of the Afon Mawddach river and the "bar" from "Aber", a common prefix in Welsh and Scottish placenames referring to a rivermouth or confluence.

Modern Welsh usage has shortened the town's name to <em>Y Bermo</em> or more formally <em>Abermaw</em>, which has officially been the name of this ward since at least 2004.  The Welsh name possibly goes further back back than that - Rallings and Thrasher's records use "Abermaw" for this ward in 1995 and 1999 - but the ministerial order made by the Welsh Office in 1994 which set out the boundaries for the future "Caernarfonshire and Merionethshire" council was written in English only and gives the ward's name as "Barmouth".  After its first election in 1995 the very first thing Caernarfonshire and Merionethshire council did was rename itself as Gwynedd council, so I suppose it's not impossible that the ward name was changed to Abermaw at the same time.  Any hard information on that would be appreciated.

The town is excluded from Parc Cenedlaethol Eryri (the Snowdonia National Park), but the Rhinog mountains come close to Barmouth nonetheless.  A short but steep climb from the town centre will bring the visitor to the gorse-covered slopes of Dinas Oleu, which in 1895 was the first land donated to the National Trust; its previous owner, Fanny Talbot, lived nearby at a house called Ty'n-y-Ffynnon which still exists.  You don't have to go far from Dinas Oleu to see the remains of industry up on these mountains: the rocks above Barmouth are rich in manganese, and they have been extensively mined.  There's also gold in them there hills, and back in the day Barmouth's businessmen were extensive investors in the Clogau gold mine just outside the boundary of the modern ward.  Clogau gold is used to make the Royal Family's wedding rings.

There is no way through the mountains unless you fancy hiking, and Barmouth has only one road in and out: vehicular traffic must either go east along the estuary to Dolgellau, or north along the coastal strip to Harlech and Ffestiniog.  The Cambrian Coast railway, which came to Barmouth in 1867, is not so restricted: it crosses the Mawddach estuary via the Barmouth Bridge, which at 900 yards long is the longest timber viaduct in Wales.  It has recently been extensively refurbished, and is open to pedestrians as well as trains.  There is also a passenger ferry to Penrhyn Point on the far side of the estuary, which connects with one of the Great Little Trains of Wales: that's the narrow-gauge Fairbourne Railway.  Cambrian Coast trains also stop on request within the ward at Llanaber, although this station was closed during the Covid-19 pandemic: its platform is only long enough to allow one train door to be opened.

The ward's economy is clearly oriented on tourism.  19.3% of Abermaw's adult residents have only Level 2 qualifications (that is, 5+ GCSEs or equivalent), which is the second-highest figure in Wales behind only Dwyrain Porthmadog further up the coast; on an England and Wales basis it places 8th, with many of the wards above it having their census returns skewed by large boarding schools.  It also has Wales' second-highest level of residents working in the accommodation and food service sector (20.7%), with only Tenby: South ranking higher; on an England and Wales basis Abermaw places 9th behind a host of other tourist resorts.

This corner of what was once Merioneth is a long way from Caernarfon and the home of Gwynedd council, which has administered this area since 1996.  Gwynedd council is run by the Welsh nationalist party Plaid Cymru, but they lost Abermaw ward in 2022 following the retirement of their councillor Gethin Williams after ten years in office.  The resulting open seat was won very convincingly by independent candidate Rob Triggs, who defeated the new Plaid candidate by the resounding score of 72-20.  Triggs, who passed away at the end of May at the untimely age of 59, had twice served as mayor of Barmouth and was a long-standing member of the town's lifeboat crew; before being elected as a councillor he had worked for 35 years as a fireman.

Different political considerations apply in the Dwyfor Meirionnydd constituency, which is represented in Westminster by Plaid Cymru's MP group leader Liz Saville Roberts and (on different boundaries) in Cardiff Bay by Mabon ap Gwynfor - a grandson of Plaid's first MP, Gwynfor Evans.  Mabon is to seek re-election to Senedd Cymru next year on the Plaid Cymru list for the expanded constituency of Gwynedd Maldwyn, in second place behind the Arfon MS Siân Gwenllian; on the votes cast in last year's Westminster election, this six-seat constituency would return two seats each for Plaid Cymru and Labour and one each for Reform UK and the Conservatives.

This political diversity is as nothing compared to one particular candidate in the Abermaw by-election.  Candidates in Welsh local elections have to declare any membership of political parties which they have held in the previous 12 months, and eyebrows were raised when the Statement of Persons Nominationed showed one candidate declaring previous memberships of the Conservatives, the Gloucestershire Independents, the Green Party, the Cornish nationlist party Mebyon Kernow, Reform UK, the continuing Liberal Party and the party under whose nomination he is actually standing here, the Pirate Party UK.  This is the latest twist in the increasingly bizarre political career of Chris Green, previously known as Chris Twells, who has recently served as a Liberal Democrat member of Salford council in Greater Manchester and Cotswold council in Gloucestershire <em>at the same time</em>, and who turned up in May's local elections as an independent candidate in Cornwall after reportedly being turned down as a candidate by multiple parties.  Green has kindly reached out to this column to provide an explanation for all these various party memberships: it turns out that he runs a business which does data processing work for most of the major political parties, and in his own words "with a couple of exceptions ... I often find it is easier to simply join the party in question to get access to its database of electors than it is to try to negotiate a one-off data sharing agreement with someone higher up the chain of command".

Two new independent candidates have come forward to succeed the late Rob Triggs, and both of them are Barmouth town councillors.  Wendy Cleaver is a further education lecturer who runs a holiday let in the town; Deana Davies Fisher was one of the people responsible for the installation of CCTV in the town centre.  Interestingly Plaid Cymru, who were second here in 2022, are not standing this time; however we do also have on this ballot Hedd Thomas for the Conservatives, Chris Green for the Pirates as already mentioned, Andrew Joyce for the Lib Dems and Terry Temple for Reform UK.  This is a Welsh local election, so Votes at 16 apply here.

<h2>Bentley</h2>

Doncaster council, South Yorkshire; caused by the resignation of Reform UK councillor Samuel Booth.

For our by-election in the north of England today we have come just to the north of Doncaster.  In Roman times this was the lowest fixed crossing-point of the River Don, and even now all north-south traffic through the city's urban area is funnelled onto two road bridges and two rail bridges just north of the city centre, which cross over the river and the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation.  The road crossing north of the river all meet up at St Mary's Roundabout, from which two major roads diverge: the A638 (the former Great North Road) on the old Roman line north-west towards Pontefract, and the A19 running north towards Selby.

The A638 still has a milestone here bearing the name of Bentley with Arksey Urban District, which existed from 1911 to 1974 and had similar boundaries to this ward.  Bentley itself lies along the A19 road, with Arksey to the east of it; the ward also includes the village of Toll Bar further along the road towards Selby.  The whole area is as flat as a pancake, and Bentley has suffered major floods on a few occasions.

Historically Bentley was a pit town and many Edwardian terraces from that era still survive.  Another legacy of the mining era is the 1930s Bentley Pavilion in the town's park, which was paid for by the local miners' welfare committee by deducting a penny from the wages of every miner.

Bentley has been part of the Doncaster North parliamentary seat since that constituency was created in 1983.  Since 2005 this seat has been represented by the former Labour Party leader Ed Miliband, who has served in Cabinet since 2024 as energy security and net zero secretary - he had also held the equivalent post in the Brown government from 2008 to 2010.  Miliband had an unusually large majority for a coalfield seat in 2024, which is largely due to an inexplicable decision by Reform UK not to stand here as part of an electoral pact with the SDP.  (The SDP candidate finished third and only narrowly saved his dsposit.)

Reform UK made no such mistake at the Doncaster mayoral and council elections last May.  The party won an overall majority on Doncaster city council from nothing, with 37 seats against 12 Labour and 6 Conservatives - but it was a different story in the simultaneous poll for Doncaster's elected mayor, where the right-wing vote was split by a strong challenge from the former Conservative MP Nick Fletcher.  Labour's mayor Ros Jones was re-elected with 33% of the vote, against 32% for Reform UK's Alexander Jones and 26% for the Conservatives' Fletcher.  If the Supplementary Vote had been reintroduced in time for this year's Doncaster mayoral election, then Reform UK would likely have won it on Conservative transfers.

The fact that Labour held the mayoralty and thus executive power in Doncaster meant that the Reform UK total of 37 seats on the council was crucial, because it just gave the party the two-thirds majority required to veto the mayoral budget.  But Doncaster Reform have already lost that advantage by going two men down.  In May they threw a councillor for Hatfield ward out of the party for racist social media, and then in July Bentley ward councillor Samuel Booth handed in his notice for personal reasons.  This gives Reform UK a tricky by-election defence in Bentley ward, which split its representation in May: the Reform UK slate won 40% and two seats, Labour polled 33% and held the other seat, while the Conservative candidate was best of the rest on 11%.

Defending this seat for Reform UK is Isaiah-John Reasbeck, who stood in May in Hexthorpe and Balby North ward on the other side of the city; on that occasion Hope Not Hate had a go at him for saying nasty things about Muslims and Bradford on his social media.  This time there may be a split on the left, because both of the defeated Labour candidates from May are back for another go: Matthew Jones has the party's nomination, while Jane Nightingale - who was a Labour councillor for this ward from 2012 until she lost her seat in May - is standing as an independent candidate.  The Conservatives' Christine Lunney, who works for an autism charity, stood unsuccessfully in Stainforth and Barnby Dun ward in May and also lost her seat on Stainforth town council at that election.  Also standing are Venessa Aradia for the Greens, Giulia Savini for the Lib Dems, Andy Hiles for the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition and Ahsan Jamil for the Workers Party.

<h2>Barrhead, Liboside and Uplawmoor</h2>

East Renfrewshire council, Scotland; caused by the death of Labour councillor Betty Cunningham.

We finish north of the border by breaking new ground for this column.  Andrew's Previews is coming to the end of its fifteenth year - our 15th anniversary is coming up in early September - and in that period council by-elections in all but three of Great Britain's local government districts have been covered by this column.  Today is the day when we cross off the list East Renfrewshire, which is holding its first council by-election since June 2001 and its first ever standalone council by-election since Scottish local government was reorganised 30 years ago.  In terms of councillor retention and political culture, they must be doing something right; maybe some other councils could usefully learn lessons from East Renfrewshire's experience.  This leaves two councils in Hampshire, Hart district and the city of Portsmouth, as the only districts which have never had the full Andrew's Previews experience.

Let's hope this was worth the wait.  We've come to Barrhead, a series of industrial villages just to the south-west of Glasgow which merged into a single town in the 19th century.  It's close enough to the big city that it was once served by the Glasgow Corporation tram network: Glasgow route 14, from Milngavie to Renfrew via the city centre, Barrhead and Paisley, was the longest tram route in Great Britain when it was withdrawn in 1957.

Barrhead became a burgh in 1894 and its first provost was William Shanks, whose "sanitary engineering company" ended up as the Shanks in the bathroom fixtures firm Armitage Shanks.  This was just one of several industries in this area back in the day, but now Barrhead is mainly a commuter town for Glasgow and Paisley.  Barrhead railway station is on the line from Glasgow Central to Kilmarnock, with frequent trains to the big city; while new housing developments at Springhill and Auchenback on the southern edge of Barrhill will soon be served by Balgray railway station on the &lt;Neilston&gt; branch line, which is under construction and expected to open next year.

The Liboside and Uplawmoor part of the ward lies some distance to the south-west along the railway line and the A736 road towards Irvine.  The village of Uplawmoor lies above the main road overlooking Loch Libo, which drains south into Ayrshire via the Lugton Water.  Loch Libo is now run as a nature reserve by the Scottish Wildlife Trust.  For some reason this ward does not include Neilston, which lies between Barrhead and Uplawmoor, but instead avoids Neilston to the north; Neilston is instead part of a different ward which also takes in part of Newton Mearns.

The present East Renfrewshire council was created in 1996 as an expanded version of the former Eastwood district.  Eastwood had previously been a very safe Conservative council, but the addition of Barrhead and Neilston changed things and East Renfrewshire has been hung since its creation.  The introduction of proportional representation in 2007 allowed the SNP to win seats here, and they are now the largest party on the council: the 2022 election returned six SNP councillors, five Conservatives, five Labour and two independents.  Labour and the independent councillors are currently running a minority administration.

Since 1997 the East Renfrewshire district has had the same boundaries as the East Renfrewshire Westminster seat (which was called Eastwood until 2005).  In contrast to the political stability of the council, this constituency has unseated its MP at every election going back to 2015, when the Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy lost his seat to the SNP.  East Renfrewshire then voted Conservative in 2017, SNP in 2019 and Labour in 2024; the current Labour MP Blair McDougall comes to the green benches from a long career as a political advisor and party strategist, which included running the Better Together campaign's strategy in the 2014 independence referendum.

For Holyrood purposes Barrhead is part of the Renfrewshire South seat, which covers a number of towns and villages to the south and west of Paisley.  This has been held since 2016 by the SNP's Tom Arthur, who has been a junior Scottish minister since the 2021 election; he has reecntly taken on the social care and mental wellbeing portfolio.  In 2021 the losing Labour candidate here was Tom O'Kane, who got into Holyrood instead as a regional MSP for the West of Scotland.  O'Kane can claim plenty of points in the "unusual things that happened to you on the campaign trail" game, having been chased down a Barrhead street by a man with a chainsaw while canvassing for the 2015 election.

The ward based on Barrhead returns four East Renfrewshire councillors, and since 2007 two of them have been independent Danny Devlin (who has polled the most first preferences in every poll here since 2007) and Labour's Betty Cunningham.  There is also an SNP seat here, while the ward's fourth seat went to Labour in 2007 and 2012, to the Conservatives in 2017 and to the SNP in 2022.  First preferences here in 2022 were 33% for the SNP, 26% for Devlin, 20% for Labour and 11% for the Conservatives.  The outgoing Conservative councillor Paul Aitken, who sought re-election as an independent candidate, polled 5%; when he was eliminated, not many of his votes transferred to his old party.  Rerunning the 2022 count here for a single seat would return Danny Devlin by 55-45 over the SNP; he won't be on the ballot for this by-election, and if we redistribute his votes then a single-seat contest would go to the SNP over Labour by the narrow margin of 51-49.

So Labour start as slight underdogs in this by-election to replace veteran councillor Betty Cunningham, who passed away in June at age of 79.  Cunningham's service went back into the first-past-the-post era, as she was first elected in 1999 as the Labour councillor for Barrhead East ward.  From 2003 to 2007 she was in the civic chair as the Provost of East Renfrewshire.  In January 2007 Cunningham travelled to the Kaponda district of Malawi, and after that experience she set up a charity which has built a health clinic and a nursery school there; this was recognised in the 2011 New Year Honours list, in which Cunningham was appointed OBE for services to the community in East Renfrewshire and Malawi.

Labour have sent in the big guns to help their defending candidate Julie Ann Costello McHale, who is very much running on being the local candidate; the Scottish Labour leader turned up in Barrhead recently in support of Costello McHale's campaign.  The SNP's David McDonald was unsuccessful candidate in the 2022 election, when he was a rather distant runner-up in Clarkston, Netherlee and Williamwood ward; on that occasion he had the disadvantage of coming up against a popular independent councillor who was also called David Macdonald (note the minor spelling difference).  Another unsuccessful candidate from 2022 who is back for another go is the Conservatives' Farooq Choudhry, a taxi driver who finished as runner-up in Newton Mearns North and Neilston ward last time.  Also on the ballot are Karen Sharkey for the Greens, Gus Ferguson in the first local election outing for the Abolish the Scottish Parliament Party, and Andy Macgibbon for Reform UK.  Votes at 16 and the Alternative Vote apply here, please mark your ballot paper in order of preference.
