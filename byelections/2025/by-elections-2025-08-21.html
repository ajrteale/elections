<!-- Andrew's previews continue to be historical and electoral tours de force. - Lord Hayward -->
<blockquote>
"All the right votes, but not necessarily in the right order"
</blockquote>
</p><p>
Eight by-elections, for nine seats, on 21st August 2025:
</p><p>
<h2>Addlestone</h2>
</p><p>
<em>Surrey county council; and</em>
</p><p>
<h2>Addlestone South</h2>
</p><p>
<em>Runnymede council, Surrey.  The county by-election follows the death of John Furey; the district by-election is for two seats following the death of Furey and the resignation of Peter Snow.  Both were Conservative councillors.</em>
</p><p>
It's pretty rare that we get a busy by-election week in August, which is not a popular time for by-election campaigning thanks to those pesky little things called school holidays.  There are just 14 council by-elections taking place over four Thursdays this month, but by some quirk of randomness eight of them have been scheduled for today.  The last time Andrew's Previews had an August day this busy was back in 2016.
</p><p>
In numerical terms the biggest prize today is in Surrey, where the Conservatives are defending four seats.  Three of them fall in Addlestone, which is a prosperous commuter town lying just within the M25 motorway; although Addlestone's rail link to central London is rather indirect, with trains going to Waterloo via Chertsey and Hounslow.  The town is divided from Weybridge to the east by the River Wey, which empties into the Thames here, and by the Wey Navigation on whose banks stands this old mill which has been converted into housing.
</p><p>

</p><p>
Although Addlestone is inside the M25 it is outside Greater London and within the area of Surrey county council.  When this column was last in Addlestone in October 2024, I wrote that the county council was the last Conservative-controlled local authority in Surrey, whatever definition of Surrey you use.  Well, despite the cancellation of the 2025 county elections this status may now be under threat: in recent months three Conservative county councillors have died and another has walked off to join Reform UK, which leaves the Conservative administration on 40 seats out of a possible 81.  In opposition are 16 Lib Dems, 16 councillors in the Residents Associations and Independent group, 2 Labour, 2 Greens, the Reform UK defector and a non-aligned councillor who was elected for the Conservatives.  Of the three pending by-elections two are taking place today while no date has yet been set for the other one in Camberley; the Conservatives need to hold at least one of those three seats to preserve their majority.
</p><p>

</p><p>
One of the late Conservative councillors was John Furey, who passed away in June having turned 80 last year.  For his day job Furey ran a florist's; but he was also a political veteran who had represented the residents of Addlestone for 25 years on both Runnymede council (since 2000) and Surrey county council (since 2009).  He was leader of Runnymede council from 2006 to 2011 and later served on the county council's cabinet.
</p><p>
Following Furey's death, the Conservative group leader on Runnymede council Peter Snow (no, not that one) decided that it was also time to leave the scene.  Snow had become disillusioned with the national party in recent years, but his resignation letter to the Runnymede Conservatives indicated that he was stepping down to put his family first.  He had served since 2018, originally being elected for Chertsey South and Row Town ward before moving to Addlestone South in 2019 following boundary changes.  The timing allows the resulting by-elections for Furey's and Snow's district council seats and Furey's county council seat to be held together, which saves time, money and effort for everyone involved.
</p><p>
Snow leaves behind a Runnymede Conservative group who are now in opposition following a disastrous set of results in May 2024 - in which Furey was re-elected for his final term of office on the borough council by just nine votes in Addlestone South, a percentage lead over Labour of 42-41.  The Runnymede council leadership is now a complicated four-way jobshare between the leaders of the Labour group (8 councillors), the Lib Dem group (6), the Runnymede Independent Residents Group (5) and the Greens (3), who are supported by the two independent councillors for Englefield Green East ward; the Conservatives (12 seats plus these two vacancies) and the independent councillors for Ottershaw ward (3) are in opposition.
</p><p>
Shortly after this we had the July 2024 general election, in which the Conservatives did manage to hang on to the Runnymede and Weybridge constituency which covers Addlestone.  Ben Spencer, who was re-elected for his second term of office fairly comfortably, was the Conservative party's deputy chairman going onto the election; he is now a shadow frontbencher for science, innovation and technology.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/runnymede-addlestone-s-2025.webp" alt="Runnymede, Addlestone S" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
In August 2024 Addlestone South ward's other Conservative councillor, Jonathan Wilson, died at the appallingly early age of 38.  Despite his relatively young age Wilson had long service on Runnymede council, having been first elected in 2006 when he was a 22-year-old student at Royal Holloway.  At the resulting by-election in October 2024 the Conservatives had no trouble defending the seat, with Steve Eldridge - a former Runnymede council communications officer - defeating Labour by the much more comfortable margin of 56-28.  Following Furey's death and Snow's resignation, Eldridge's nine months of service makes him the senior councillor for Addlestone South.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/surrey-cc-addlestone-2025.webp" alt="Surrey CC, Addlestone" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
John Furey's last re-election to Surrey county council in May 2021 was similarly comfortable, as he polled 50% of the vote against 19% for Labour and 14% for the Greens.  The county division and ward boundaries don't match up here, but Addlestone county division covers effectively all of Addlestone South, all of Addlestone North which has recently voted Green at Runnymede council level, part of Ottershaw ward which returns independent borough councillors, and a small part of Chertsey Riverside ward (most of which is the buildings and grounds of St George's Weybridge, a Catholic independent school).
</p><p>
Defending the Addlestone county council seat for the Conservatives against this diverse opposition is Shannon Saise-Marshall, who is a borough councillor for Chertsey Riverside ward.  The Labour candidate Arran Neathey is a former Runnymede councillor, who represented Egham Hythe ward from 2019 to 2021.  Standing for the Greens is one of the four co-leaders of Runnymede council: Steven Ringham, who represents Addlestone North ward, was also the Green candidate for Runnymede and Weybridge in last year's general election.  Completing the county ballot paper are Runnymede councillor Mike Smith for the Lib Dems and Scott Kelly for Reform UK.
</p><p>
The district by-election in Addlestone South is for two seats so the electors each get two votes here.  Here the defending Conservative candidates are Howard Freeman and Mike Kusneraitis: Freeman is described as a keen community volunteer who runs an IT business and who contested New Haw last year, while Kusneraitis is a long-serving former Runnymede councillor who appeared in this column last December as the Conservative candidate for a by-election in Ottershaw ward.  For Labour, Arran Neathey doubles up at county and district level and he is joined on the district ballot paper by Elaine Percival, who was a close runner-up here in May 2024 and a rather more distant runner-up at the October 2024 by-election.  Also standing are Jenny Coulon and Ronan McCaughey for the Lib Dems, Izabela Wawryszuk for the Greens, and Scott Kelly (again) and Sam Newman for Reform UK.

<h2>Hinchley Wood, Claygate and Oxshott</h2>
</p><p>
<em>Surrey county council; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Mark Sugden.</em>
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/claygate-station.webp" alt="Claygate Station" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Our other Surrey county council poll today falls along three London outer suburbs linked together by the New Guildford railway line, which runs between Waterloo and Guildford via Cobham.  Clayate and Oxshott stations opened with the line in 1885, with Hinchley Wood station following later in 1930; despite being closer to London, Hinchley Wood developed later than the other two suburbs.  Oxshott has a reputation as a very exclusive and expensive area packed with rich and famous people: part of the reason for this is that it is close to Chelsea FC's training ground in Stoke d'Abernon, and the club requires that its players live close to the training ground.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/surrey-cc-hinchley-wood-claygate-oxshott-2025.webp" alt="Surrey CC, Hinchley Wood/Claygate/Oxshott" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
As the name suggests Claygate is built on clay: the Claygate Beds are recognised by geologists as a particular subspecies of London Clay, and the Claygate and Oxshott area is one of the few locations where London Clay comes close to the surface.  In consequence of this geology, brickworking was the major industry here in times gone by.  The A3 Esher Bypass runs between Claygate and Oxshott, while Claygate and Hinchley Wood are separated from each other by Telegraph Hill: there is still a building on this hilltop which once had a semaphore tower, forming one of a chain of towers which transmitted naval messages between London and Portsmouth in minutes during the early 19th century.
</p><p>
The Esher bypass now forms a constituency boundary.  Oxshott is part of the Runnymede and Weybridge constituency which we considered in the previous section, while Claygate and Hinchley Wood are in the seat of Esher and Walton.  This was gained by the Liberal Democrats in 2024; the MP Monica Harding is the party's international development spokeswoman, building on her previous career overseas with the British Council and with the Japan branch of Refugees International.  Harding took the seat over from the retiring Dominic Raab, who had been forced to resign as deputy prime minister in 2023 for bullying civil servants; as a prominent Brexiteer, Raab was also an increasingly poor political fit for his constituency.
</p><p>
The Lib Dem win here last year built on some years of work on Elmbridge council, where the Lib Dems are now the largest party although an overall majority has so far eluded them.  Instead they run Elmbridge in coalition with a galaxy of Residents' Associations, who have traditionally been the main opposition to Conservatives in local elections.  The ward and county division boundaries don't match up here, but Hinchley Wood's councillors are jointly nominated by the Hinchley Wood and Weston Green Residents' Associations; Oxshott is part of a ward with Stoke d'Abernon which is safely Conservative even in current political conditions; while Claygate is normally safe Lib Dem but was lost to an ex-Lib Dem independent candidate in 2024 in a row over the proposed development of a Marks and Spencer food hall.  This wasn't just any loss, this was an M&amp;S loss; and embarrassingly for the Lib Dems, the councillor who lost his seat in Claygate last year was the leader of the council.
</p><p>
The overall effect of this in recent years has been that the Hinchley Wood, Claygate and Oxshott county division has been very closely contested between the Conservatives and Lib Dems, with the 2017 and 2021 elections both delivering knife-edge results: the Conservatives won on both occasions, with majorities of 50-47 in 2017 and 47-44 in 2021.  In the later election the outgoing Conservative county councillor Mike Bennison had defected to Reform UK before it was fashionable and sought re-election under his new colours; he finished third but polled only 4.4%.
</p><p>
Bennison's seat was taken over in 2021 by the Conservatives' Mark Sugden, a native Yorkshireman who had settled in Claygate following an international business career.  Sugden had served for some years on Claygate parish council before he made the step up to the county council.  He died in May at the age of 65, following a long period of ill-health.
</p><p>
Defending this highly marginal seat for the Conservatives is Andrew Burley, who is an Elmbridge councillor for Oxshott and Stoke d'Abernon ward.  He has a confusingly similar name to the Lib Dem candidate Andy Burton, who is fighting his first election campaign following a career in the City and overseas.  This sense of confusion continues on the populist right where Nicholas Wood is standing for Reform UK: Wood has previously been a regular candidate in the Elmbridge area for UKIP, and his new political affiliation apparently came as something of a surprise to UKIP who still list him on the Electoral Commission register as a UKIP Surrey branch officer.  Clearly they hadn't got the message that he'd quit.  Wood completes the ballot paper along with Irene Threlkeld for Labour, Sarah Coomes for the Green Party and independent candidate Mary Marshall, a former Lib Dem Elmbridge councillor who returned to that council as the independent councillor elected for Claygate ward last year.

<h2>Cranford</h2>
</p><p>
<em>Hounslow council, London; caused by the death of Labour councillor Sukhbir Singh Dhaliwal.</em>
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/cranford-tv.webp" alt="Cranford, BBC" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
We now travel to a small market town not far from the large industrial city of Drumle, as we examine small-town customs and values in Victorian England...
</p><p>
<em>[consults notes...]</em>
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/hounslow-cranford-2025.webp" alt="Hounslow, Cranford" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Sorry, wrong Cranford.  This isn't a Mrs Gaskell novel.  Nonetheless Cranford was described for centuries as one of the smallest and prettiest villages in Middlesex; but it has since turned into the point on the A4 Bath Road and the A30 Great South West Road where the London built-up area ends and Heathrow Airport begins.
</p><p>
This ward has a majority Asian population, mostly from India.  Cranford ranks 14th of the wards in England and Wales for residents born in Asia and the Middle East (39.2%) and 25th for Sikhism (18.2%).  It has very low qualification levels by London standards, ranking in the top 10 wards in the capital for adults with Level 1 qualifications (that is, 1-4 GCSEs or equivalent).
</p><p>
Cranford has an important impact on the UK's economy thanks to the Cranford Agreement, which restricts eastbound takeoffs from the northern runway at Heathrow to reduce the noise impact of the airport on local residents; Cranford is directly beyond the end of that runway.  Heathrow Airport dominates not just this ward's noise levels but also its economy, and Cranford ranks 9th of the wards in England and Wales for residents employed in the transport sector (16.9%) and 29th for those working in administrative or support services (10.1%).
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/cranford-hotel.webp" alt="Travelodge at Cranford" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Another economic contribution from the airport is the presence of airport hotels, and in early November 2011 your columnist was put up in an airport hotel in Cranford ward.  This was courtesy of Sky TV, whose studios are a few miles up the A4, and who had graciously let me on to a rather curious quiz programme called <em>Cleverdicks</em> and hosted by Anne Widdecombe.  My performance in the studio was not great, and I spent the evening after the recording drowning my sorrows, buying drinks for the show's winner Rob Hannah and persuading him that he would win a serious prize in the next day's recording.  (I think he did.)
</p><p>
On my way to the hotel that evening, the newsagents' billboards were announcing the death that day of Alan Keen, the Labour MP for the local seat of Feltham and Heston.  The resulting by-election in December 2011 was held for Labour by Seema Malhotra who has retained the seat ever since.  Malhotra is a junior frontbencher at the Home Office whose portfolios include some of the very hottest political issues right now: migration, citizenship <em>and</em> equalities.  If you can cope with all that, you can cope with anything.
</p><p>
Malhotra is not the only Labour politician associated with Cranford.  For centuries the aristocratic Berkeley family were major landowners here, and they are currently represented in the Lords by Anthony Gueterbock.  He was a civil engineer working on the Channel Tunnel when he succeeded to his aunt's titles and entered the House of Lords in 1992 as the 18th Lord Berkeley, becoming that rarest of things: a Labour hereditary peer.  Berkeley was not among the 92 hereditary peers who remained in the Lords following the 1999 reform, but he returned to the red benches a few months later by being awarded the life peerage title of Lord Gueterbock.  (His wife Marian, the present Baroness Berkeley, has previously served on the Council of the Isles of Scilly.)
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/cranford-boundary.webp" alt="Cranford boundary marker" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Lord Berkeley's life peerage appears to have come with the territorial designation "of Cranford, in the London Borough of Hillingdon", but Cranford is in fact covered by Hounslow council.  It's part of the Labour majority on that council and Labour have won every election here this century, including by-elections in February 2016 and May 2021.  The 2022 poll, the only previous result on the current ward boundaries, gave 53% to the Labour slate, 19% to the Conservatives and 14% to the Green Party.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2022/hounslow22s.svgz" alt="Hounslow, 2022" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Previous ballot papers for Cranford ward have included unsuccessful challenges by two now-defunct parties with references to animals in their name.  A BEE C, a Brentford FC supporters' group, stood here in 2002 as they did in many other Hounslow wards that year; in fact A BEE C actually won a seat in the 2002 Hounslow elections, appropriately enough in Brentford ward.  (Their winning candidate defeated Labour's runner-up and future MP Seema Malhotra by 13 votes; one of the other winning candidates for Brentford ward that year was Labour's Ruth Cadbury, who is now the other MP for the Hounslow borough.)  Some years later the 2010 election in Cranford was contested by a localist group which, in an apparent reference to the Beavers Lane Estate in the south of the ward, was called "Beavers Cranford Party".  Now there's a Mrs Gaskell adaptation which you definitely need age verification to watch.
</p><p>
This by-election is to replace Sukhbir Singh Dhaliwal following his death in June.  He had served on Hounslow council since winning the 2016 Cranford by-election.  Nine years ago I described him as "a former bus driver who is seeking to return to Hounslow council having represented Hendon West ward from 2006 to 2010"; in fact this sold Dhaliwal short, because he had previously sat as a councillor for Cranford ward from 1994 to 2002.  (Rallings and Thrasher's records show him as seeking re-election for the Conservatives in 2002, but this was not the case: the relevant Conservative candidate in 2002 was Surjit Dhaliwal, not Sukhbir.)
</p><p>
One of the candidates in the by-election to replace Dhaliwal is notable enough for Wikipedia.  Gurpal Singh Virdi had a long career in the Metropolitan Police which was marred by racism and discrimination: he was sacked from the force in 2000 for sending race hate mail to colleagues, before being exonerated by the Employment Tribunal and in a subsequent inquiry by the Metropolitan Police Authority.  Virdi eventually retired from the police in 2012, and he stood in 2014 as a Labour candidate in Cranford ward and won despite being disendorsed by the party during the campaign following an arrest on suspicion of indecent assault and misconduct in public office.  The subsequent trial in 2015 found Virdi not guilty on all charges and he was admitted to the Labour whip, but he didn't seek re-election in 2018; he then stood in 2022 as an independent candidate, finishing in last place with 13%.  Virdi is now trying to return to Hounslow council again, and this time he has the Green Party nomination.
</p><p>
Defending this seat for Labour is Hira Singh Dhillon who has lived in Cranford for 58 years; he is retired following a long career on the London Underground and the railways as a guard, driver and booking clerk.  The Conservatives have selected Gurpreet Singh Sidhu who is fighting his first election campaign.  As stated in the previous paragraph, Gurpal Singh Virdi is standing for the Greens.  Two representatives of parties which didn't stand here in 2022 complete the ballot paper: they are Miruna Leitoiu for the Lib Dems and Khushwant Singh for Reform UK.

<h2>Alton Amery</h2>
</p><p>
<em>East Hampshire council; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Steve Hunt.</em>
</p><p>
If I disappointed you with the Cranford in the previous section not being the literary one, we are on slightly firmer ground with the Hampshire town of Alton which is strongly associated with Jane Austen: her former home at Chawton lies just south of the town.  Within Alton itself we find a plaque on an old building on Amery Street, which states that the Elizabethan poet Edmund Spenser once lived there in 1590 (the year that <em>The Faerie Queene</em> was published); however, it's fair to say that there is no documentary evidence to support this.
</p><p>
Amery Street leads uphill from the town centre to Amery Hill School, a secondary school with academy status located in the north of the town.  Its former pupils include Matthew Offord, who went on to serve from 2010 to 2024 as Conservative MP for Hendon, and the dance musician Alison Goldfrapp.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/e-hants-alton-amery-2025.webp" alt="E Hants, Alton Amery" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Beyond the school we find Alton Amery ward, which covers housing on the north-western fringe of the town.  Also here are a series of watermeadows off the B3349 road which form the source of the River Wey, which flows north-east into Surrey.  We were at the other end of the Wey earlier, as the river empties into the Thames between the towns of Weybridge and Addlestone.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/alton-wey.webp" alt="Source of the River Wey" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Alton is the largest town in the East Hampshire local government district, which is run by the Conservatives in coalition with the Whitehill and Bordon Community Party after the Tories lost their majority in the 2023 election.  That poll returned 19 Conservatives, 14 Lib Dems, 6 members of the Whitehill and Bordon Community Party, 2 Greens, 1 Labour and 1 independent councillor.  Last year the Lib Dems successfully defended a by-election in Four Marks and Medstead ward, which lies to the south-west of Alton and includes Chawton.

Alton Amery ward has been in the Lib Dem column since the current ward boundaries were introduced in 2019; in 2023 the outgoing councillor Steve Hunt, who led the Lib Dem opposition on the council at the time, was re-elected with a 53-29 lead over the Conservatives.  Hunt had previously narrowly failed to be elected to Hampshire county council at its last election in 2021, when the Conservatives held the Alton Town division by less than 100 votes.  There was also a Lib Dem near-miss in 2024 in the East Hampshire parliamentary seat which includes Alton: the Conservative former education secretary Damian Hinds was re-elected for his fifth term of office with a majority of 1,275 votes.
</p><p>
The Liberal Democrats will have to defend this by-election following Steve Hunt's resignation, and they have selected Lizzie Marshall who teaches nursing and health and social care.  She is fighting her first election campaign as is the wonderfully-named Conservative candidate Brighton Gono, a Zimbabwean by birth whose career has taken him to Alton via Australia.  The only other candidate is Richard Moore who is hoping to become East Hampshire's first Reform UK councillor.

<h2>Abermaw</h2>
</p><p>
<em>Gwynedd council, Wales; caused by the death of independent councillor Rob Triggs.</em>
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/barmouth-town.jpg" alt="Barmouth" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
For today's Welsh by-election it's time to come to a proper holiday resort, in this school holiday month.  And don't just take my word for it that Barmouth, on the western coast of Wales, is a nice place.  Wordsworth had nice words for Barmouth in the early 19th century, and it features prominently as a location in the 2001 novel <em>Austerlitz</em>, by the German writer W G Sebald.  <em>Austerlitz</em>' protagonist grew up here, as did the jazz musician and music journalist Russell Davies who since 2010 has been the permanent host of the Radio 4 quiz <em>Brain of Britain</em>.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/gwynedd-abermaw-2025.webp" alt="Gwynedd, Abermaw" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
The English-language name "Barmouth" might be suggestive of the town's location at the mouth of an estuary; but if you thought that you've got it the wrong way round.  "Barmouth" is in fact an Anglicisation of the Welsh name <em>Abermawddach</em>, with the "mouth" referring to the name of the Afon Mawddach river and the "bar" from "Aber", a common prefix in Welsh and Scottish placenames referring to a rivermouth or confluence.
</p><p>
Modern Welsh usage has shortened the town's name to <em>Y Bermo</em> or more formally <em>Abermaw</em>, which has officially been the name of this ward since at least 2004.  The Welsh ward name possibly goes further back back than that - Rallings and Thrasher's records use "Abermaw" for this ward in 1995 and 1999 - but the ministerial order made by the Welsh Office in 1994 which set out the boundaries for the future "Caernarfonshire and Merionethshire" council was written in English only and gives the ward's name as "Barmouth".  After its first election in 1995 the very first thing Caernarfonshire and Merionethshire council did was rename itself as Gwynedd council, so I suppose it's not impossible that the ward name was officially changed to Abermaw at the same time.  Any hard information on that would be appreciated.
</p><p>
The town is excluded from Parc Cenedlaethol Eryri (the Snowdonia National Park), but the Rhinog mountains come close to Barmouth nonetheless.  A short but steep climb from the town centre will bring the visitor to the gorse-covered slopes of Dinas Oleu, which in 1895 was the first land donated to the National Trust; its previous owner, Fanny Talbot, lived nearby at a house called Ty'n-y-Ffynnon which still exists.  You don't have to go far from Dinas Oleu to see the remains of industry up on these mountains: the rocks above Barmouth are rich in manganese, and they have been extensively mined.  There's also gold in them there hills, and back in the day Barmouth's businessmen were extensive investors in the Clogau gold mine just outside the boundary of this ward.  Clogau gold is used to make the Royal Family's wedding rings.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/barmouth-bridge.webp" alt="Barmouth Bridge" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
There is no way through the mountains unless you fancy hiking, and Barmouth has only one road in and one road out: vehicular traffic must either go east along the estuary to Dolgellau, or north along the coastal strip to Harlech and Ffestiniog.  The Cambrian Coast railway, which came to Barmouth in 1867, is not so restricted: it crosses the mouth of the Mawddach estuary to the south via the Barmouth Bridge, which at 900 yards long is the longest timber viaduct in Wales.  The bridge has recently been extensively refurbished, and it is open to pedestrians as well as trains.  There is also a passenger ferry to Penrhyn Point on the far side of the estuary, which connects with one of the Great Little Trains of Wales: that's the narrow-gauge Fairbourne Railway.  Cambrian Coast trains also stop on request within the ward at Llanaber, although this station was closed during the Covid-19 pandemic: its platform is only long enough to allow one train door to be opened.
</p><p>
This area's economy is clearly oriented on tourism.  19.3% of Abermaw's adult residents have only Level 2 qualifications (that is, 5+ GCSEs or equivalent), which is the second-highest figure in Wales behind only Dwyrain Porthmadog further up the coast; on an England and Wales basis it places 8th, with many of the wards above it having their census returns skewed by large boarding schools.  It also has Wales' second-highest level of residents working in the accommodation and food service sector (20.7%), with only Tenby: South ranking higher; on an England and Wales basis Abermaw places 9th behind a host of other tourist resorts.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2022/gwynedd22s.svgz" alt="Gwynedd, 2022" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
This corner of what was once Merioneth is a long way from Caernarfon and the home of Gwynedd council, which has administered this area since 1996.  Gwynedd council is run by the Welsh nationalist party Plaid Cymru, but they lost Abermaw ward in 2022 following the retirement of their councillor Gethin Williams after ten years in office.  The resulting open seat was won very convincingly by independent candidate Rob Triggs, who defeated the new Plaid candidate by the resounding score of 72-20.  Triggs, who passed away at the end of May at the untimely age of 59, had twice served as mayor of Barmouth and was a long-standing member of the town's lifeboat crew; before being elected as a councillor he had worked for 35 years as a fireman.
</p><p>
Different political considerations apply in the Dwyfor Meirionnydd constituency, which is represented in Westminster by Plaid Cymru's MP group leader Liz Saville Roberts and (on different boundaries) in Cardiff Bay by Mabon ap Gwynfor - a grandson of Plaid's first MP, Gwynfor Evans.  Mabon is to seek re-election to Senedd Cymru next year on the Plaid Cymru list for the expanded constituency of Gwynedd Maldwyn, in second place behind the Arfon MS Siân Gwenllian; on the votes cast in last year's Westminster election, this six-seat constituency would return two seats each for Plaid Cymru and Labour and one each for Reform UK and the Conservatives.
</p><p>
This political diversity is as nothing compared to one particular candidate in the Abermaw by-election.  Candidates in Welsh local elections have to declare any membership of political parties which they have held in the previous 12 months, and eyebrows were raised when the Statement of Persons Nominated showed one candidate for this by-election declaring previous memberships of the Conservatives, the Gloucestershire Independents, the Green Party, the Cornish nationalist party Mebyon Kernow, Reform UK, the continuing Liberal Party <em>and</em> the party under whose nomination he is actually standing here, the Pirate Party UK.  This is the latest twist in the increasingly bizarre political career of Chris Green, previously known as Chris Twells, who has recently served as a Liberal Democrat member of Salford council in Greater Manchester and Cotswold council in Gloucestershire <em>at the same time</em>, and who turned up in May's local elections as an independent candidate in Cornwall after reportedly being turned down as a candidate by multiple parties.  Green has kindly got in touch with this column to provide an explanation for all these various party memberships: it turns out that he runs a business which does data processing work for most of the major political parties, and his experience is that joining the party in question makes it significantly easier for him to get hold of the required data.
</p><p>
Two new independent candidates have come forward to succeed the late Rob Triggs, and both of them are Barmouth town councillors.  Wendy Cleaver is a further education lecturer who runs a holiday let in the town; Deana Davies Fisher, who gives an address in Talybont just to the north of this ward, was one of the people responsible for the installation of CCTV in Barmouth town centre.  Interestingly Plaid Cymru, who were second here in 2022, are not standing this time; however we do also have on this ballot Hedd Thomas for the Conservatives, Chris Green for the Pirates as already mentioned, Andrew Joyce for the Lib Dems and Terry Temple for Reform UK.  This is a Welsh local election, so Votes at 16 apply here.

<h2>Bentley</h2>
</p><p>
<em>Doncaster council, South Yorkshire; caused by the resignation of Reform UK councillor Samuel Booth.</em>
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/doncaster-bentley-2025.webp" alt="Doncaster, Bentley" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
For our by-election in the north of England today we have come just to the north of Doncaster.  In Roman times this was the lowest fixed crossing-point of the River Don, and even now all north-south traffic through the city's urban area is funnelled onto two road bridges and two rail bridges just north of the city centre, which cross over the river and the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation.  The road crossings north of the river all meet up at St Mary's Roundabout, from which two major roads diverge: the A638 (the former Great North Road) on the old Roman line north-west towards Pontefract, and the A19 running north towards Selby.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/bentley-milestone.jpg" alt="Milestone, Bentley with Arksey" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
The A638 still has a milestone here bearing the name of Bentley with Arksey Urban District, which existed from 1911 to 1974 and had similar boundaries to this ward.  Bentley itself lies along the A19 road, with Arksey to the east of it; the ward also includes the village of Toll Bar further along the road towards Selby.  The whole area is as flat as a pancake, and Bentley has suffered major floods on a few occasions.
</p><p>
Historically Bentley was a pit town and many Edwardian miners' terraces still survive here.  Another legacy of the mining era is the 1930s Bentley Pavilion in the town's park, which was paid for by the local miners' welfare committee by deducting a penny from the wages of every miner.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/bentley-pavilion.webp" alt="Bentley Pavilion" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Bentley has been part of the Doncaster North parliamentary seat since that constituency was created in 1983.  Since 2005 this seat has been represented by the former Labour Party leader Ed Miliband, who has served in Cabinet since 2024 as energy security and net zero secretary - he had also held the equivalent post in the Brown government from 2008 to 2010.  Miliband had an unusually large majority for a coalfield seat in 2024, which is largely due to a bizarre decision by Reform UK not to stand here as part of an electoral pact with the SDP.  (The SDP candidate finished third but only narrowly saved his deposit.)
</p><p>
Reform UK made no such mistake at the Doncaster mayoral and council elections last May.  The party won an overall majority on Doncaster city council from nothing, with 37 seats against 12 Labour and 6 Conservatives - but it was a different story in the simultaneous poll for Doncaster's elected mayor, where the right-wing vote was split by a strong challenge from the former Conservative MP Nick Fletcher.  Labour's mayor Ros Jones was re-elected with 33% of the vote, against 32% for Reform UK's Alexander Jones and 26% for the Conservatives' Fletcher.  If the Supplementary Vote had been reintroduced in time for this year's Doncaster mayoral election, then Reform UK would likely have won it on Conservative transfers.
</p><p>
The fact that Labour retained the mayoralty and thus executive power in Doncaster meant that the Reform UK total of 37 seats on the council was crucial, because it just gave the party the two-thirds majority required to veto the mayoral budget.  But Doncaster Reform have already lost that advantage by going two men down.  In May they threw a councillor for Hatfield ward out of the party for racist social media, and then in July Bentley ward councillor Samuel Booth handed in his notice for personal reasons.  This gives Reform UK a tricky by-election defence in Bentley ward, which split its representation in May: the Reform UK slate won 40% and two seats, Labour polled 33% and held the other seat, while the Conservative candidate was best of the rest on 11%.
</p><p>
Defending this seat for Reform UK is Isaiah-John Reasbeck, who stood in May in Hexthorpe and Balby North ward on the other side of the city; on that occasion Hope Not Hate had a go at him for saying nasty things about Muslims and Bradford on his social media.  This time there may be a split on the left, because both of the defeated Labour candidates from May are back for another go: Matthew Jones has the party's nomination, while Jane Nightingale - who was a Labour councillor for this ward from 2012 until she lost her seat in May - is standing as an independent candidate.  The Conservatives' Christine Lunney, who works for an autism charity, stood unsuccessfully in Stainforth and Barnby Dun ward in May and also lost her seat on Stainforth town council at that election.  Also standing are Venessa Aradia for the Greens, Giulia Savini for the Lib Dems, Andy Hiles for the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition and Ahsan Jamil for the Workers Party.

<h2>Barrhead, Liboside and Uplawmoor</h2>
</p><p>
<em>East Renfrewshire council, Scotland; caused by the death of Labour councillor Betty Cunningham.</em>
</p><p>
We finish north of the border by breaking new ground for this column.  Andrew's Previews is nearly at the end of its fifteenth year - our anniversary is coming up in early September - and in that period council by-elections in all but three of Great Britain's local government districts have been covered by this column.  Today is the day when we cross off the list East Renfrewshire, which is holding its first council by-election since June 2001 and its first ever standalone council by-election since Scottish local government was reorganised 30 years ago.  In terms of councillor retention and political culture, they must be doing something right; maybe some other councils could usefully learn lessons from East Renfrewshire's experience.  This leaves two councils in Hampshire, Hart district and the city of Portsmouth, as the only districts which have never had the full Andrew's Previews experience.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/e-renfs-barrhead-liboside-uplawmoor-2025.webp" alt="E Renfs, Barrhead/Liboside/Uplawmoor" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Let's hope this was worth the wait.  We've come to Barrhead, a series of industrial villages in the Levern valley just to the south-west of Glasgow which merged into a single town in the 19th century.  It's close enough to the big city that it was once served by the Glasgow Corporation tram network: Glasgow route 14, from Milngavie to Renfrew via the city centre, Barrhead and Paisley, was the longest tram route in Great Britain when it was withdrawn in 1957.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/barrhead-burgh-hall.webp" alt="Barrhead Burgh Hall" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Barrhead became a burgh in 1894 and its first provost was William Shanks, whose "sanitary engineering company" ended up as the Shanks in the bathroom fixtures firm Armitage Shanks.  This was just one of several industries in this area back in the day, but now Barrhead is mainly a commuter town for Glasgow and Paisley.  Barrhead railway station is on the line from Glasgow Central to Kilmarnock, with frequent trains to the big city; while new housing developments at Springhill and Auchenback on the southern edge of Barrhill will soon be served by Balgray railway station on the &lt;Neilston&gt; branch line, which is under construction and expected to open next year.
</p><p>
The Liboside and Uplawmoor part of the ward lies some distance to the south-west along the railway line and the A736 road towards Irvine.  The village of Uplawmoor lies above the main road overlooking Loch Libo, which drains south into Ayrshire via the Lugton Water.  Loch Libo is now run as a nature reserve by the Scottish Wildlife Trust.  For some reason this ward does not include Neilston, which lies between Barrhead and Uplawmoor, but instead avoids Neilston to the north; Neilston is part of a different ward which also takes in part of Newton Mearns.
</p><p>
The present East Renfrewshire council was created in 1996 as an expanded version of the former Eastwood district.  Eastwood had previously been a very safe Conservative council, but the addition of Barrhead and Neilston changed things and East Renfrewshire has been hung since its creation.  The introduction of proportional representation in 2007 allowed the SNP to win seats here, and they are now the largest party on the council: the 2022 election returned six SNP councillors, five Conservatives, five Labour and two independents.  Labour and the independent councillors are currently running a minority administration.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2022/e-renfs22s.svgz" alt="E Renfs, 2022" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Since 1997 the East Renfrewshire district has had the same boundaries as the East Renfrewshire Westminster seat (which was called Eastwood until 2005).  In contrast to the political stability of the council, this constituency has unseated its MP at every election going back to 2015, when the Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy lost his seat to the SNP.  East Renfrewshire then voted Conservative in 2017, SNP in 2019 and Labour in 2024; the current Labour MP Blair McDougall comes to the green benches from a long career as a political advisor and party strategist, which included running the Better Together campaign's strategy in the 2014 independence referendum.
</p><p>
For Holyrood purposes Barrhead is currently part of the Renfrewshire South seat, which covers a number of towns and villages to the south and west of Paisley.  This has been held since 2016 by the SNP's Tom Arthur, who has been a junior Scottish minister since the 2021 election; he has recently taken on the social care and mental wellbeing portfolio.  In 2021 the losing Labour candidate here was Tom O'Kane, who got into Holyrood instead as a regional MSP for the West of Scotland.  O'Kane can claim plenty of points in the "unusual things that happened to you on the campaign trail" game, having been chased down a Barrhead street by a man with a chainsaw while canvassing for the 2015 Westminster election.  Arthur and O'Kane have been selected to face off against each other for the third time in the 2026 Holyrood election; assuming that the recently-recommended Holyrood constituency boundary changes are successfully implemented, this contest will be in a redrawn seat with the new name of "Renfrewshire West and Levern Valley".
</p><p>
The ward based on Barrhead returns four East Renfrewshire councillors, and since 2007 two of them have been independent Danny Devlin (who has polled the most first preferences in every poll here since 2007) and Labour's Betty Cunningham.  There is also an SNP seat here, while the ward's fourth seat went to Labour in 2007 and 2012, to the Conservatives in 2017 and to the SNP in 2022.  First preferences here in 2022 were 33% for the SNP, 26% for Devlin, 20% for Labour and 11% for Greg Turner, who was on the ballot as the Conservative candidate but had been disendorsed by the party for bigoted online remarks about Catholics and for describing Barrhead as having "by far the biggest population of mentally challengeds in East Renfrewshire".  The outgoing Conservative councillor Paul Aitken, who had fallen out with the Conservatives some years earlier and sought re-election as an independent candidate, polled 5%; when he was eliminated in sixth place, not many of his votes transferred to his old party.  Rerunning the 2022 count here for a single seat would return Danny Devlin by 55-45 over the SNP; Devlin won't be on the ballot for this by-election, and if we redistribute his votes then a single-seat contest would go to the SNP over Labour by the narrow margin of 51-49.
</p><p>
So Labour start as underdogs in this by-election to replace veteran councillor Betty Cunningham, who passed away in June at age of 79.  Cunningham's service went back into the first-past-the-post era, as she was first elected in 1999 as the Labour councillor for Barrhead East ward.  From 2003 to 2007 she was in the civic chair as the Provost of East Renfrewshire.  In January 2007 Cunningham travelled to the Kaponda district of Malawi, and that led to her setting up a charity which has built a health clinic and a nursery school there; this was recognised in the 2011 New Year Honours list, in which Cunningham was appointed OBE for services to the community in East Renfrewshire and Malawi.
</p><p>
Labour have sent in the big guns to help their defending candidate Julie Ann Costello McHale, who is very much running on being the local candidate; the Scottish Labour leader turned up in Barrhead recently in support of Costello McHale's campaign.  The SNP's David McDonald was an unsuccessful candidate in the 2022 election, when he was a rather distant runner-up in Clarkston, Netherlee and Williamwood ward; on that occasion he had the disadvantage of coming up against a popular independent councillor who was also called David Macdonald (note the minor spelling difference).  Another unsuccessful candidate from 2022 who is back for another go is the Conservatives' Farooq Choudhry, a taxi driver who finished as runner-up in Newton Mearns North and Neilston ward last time.  Also on the ballot are Karen Sharkey for the Greens, Gus Ferguson in the first local election outing for the Abolish the Scottish Parliament Party, and Andy Macgibbon for Reform UK.  Votes at 16 and the Alternative Vote apply here, please mark your ballot paper in order of preference.
