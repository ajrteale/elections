One by-election on Tuesday 2nd December 2025:
</p><p>
<h2>Long Eaton North</h2>
</p><p>
<em>Derbyshire county council; caused by the resignation of Reform UK councillor Jack Bradley.</em>
</p><p>
Andrew's Previews has six by-elections to bring you this week, two of which are in the urban and suburban area between Derby and Nottingham centred on the River Erewash, which forms the border between Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire.  On Thursday we will be in Stapleford on the Nottinghamshire side of the river: but today's special Tuesday preview will be in the Derbyshire town of Long Eaton.
</p><p>
Long Eaton lies on the north bank of the River Trent, and it grew into an industrial centre in the Victorian era.  This was mainly thanks to the railways.  The Midland Counties Railway came here in 1839, opening a three-way network linking together Derby, Nottingham and Leicester; its three arms all came together at Trent Junction, a tangle of sharply-curved railway tracks on the floodplain just to the south of Long Eaton.  In 1844 a fourth branch line was built going north up the Erewash valley, and just to the north of the town an enormous railway complex developed at Toton.  At its peak in the 1950s Toton was the largest marshalling yard in Europe, handling and sorting coal traffic from the East Midlands collieries and also building and maintaining railway wagons.
</p><p>
Some of the coal which passed through Toton was consumed by Ratcliffe-on-Soar power station just to the south of Long Eaton, which was the UK's last coal-fired power plant when it closed in September last year.  The power station buildings are slated for demolition in the next few years.  In the meantime, the decommissioned cooling towers featured last week in an unusual musical performance which exploited their unique acoustic.

</p><p>
The railways and lacemaking were the traditional mainstays of Long Eaton's industry.  And there could have been more railway work to come here in the future.  Nearby Toton was slated as the location for the East Midlands station of High Speed 2, and its link to the Nottingham tram network and siting on railway land would have made it a good site.  However, this proposal disappeared when the High Speed 2 eastern leg was cancelled in 2021.
</p><p>
The Toton marshalling yard lies to the east of Long Eaton North division, and is separated from it by the Erewash Canal, the Toton Washlands nature reserve, the River Erewash and the county boundary.  The western boundary of this division is the M1 motorway.  Most of Long Eaton North's housing lies to the north of the Derby Road which runs west from the town centre, but the boundary also extends south of the Derby Road to take in West Park and the independent school of Trent College.  This is a boarding school, but there aren't enough boarders here to have a significant effect on the area's census return.
</p><p>
Although Long Eaton has Nottingham postcodes and it is a part of the Nottingham built-up area, it's located on the western side of the River Erewash and thus is part of Derbyshire.  Specifically, it's located within the Erewash parliamentary seat, which has voted for the government at every general election since it was created in 1983.  The present Labour MP Adam Thompson, who gained his seat from the Conservatives in 2024, had been a research scientist at the University of Nottingham and a union representative for the University and College Union before his election to Parliament.
</p><p>
Erewash council was a Labour gain from the Conservatives in the 2023 local elections, and the two Erewah wards which make up this county division - Derby Road East and Deeby Road West - returned a full slate of five Labour councillors in 2023.  Derby Road West, which is the larger and less working-class of the two wards, had previously voted Conservative.

</p><p>
Until May this area was covered by the Petersham division of Derbyshire county council, which had voted for the winning party in every Derbyshire county election since at least 2005.  The renamed and slightly-redrawn Long Eaton North division has continued that trend, because it was won by Reform UK in May 2025 on vote shares of 36% for Reform UK, 24% for Labour and 23% for the Conservatives.
</p><p>
There has recently been some analysis of how Reform UK are getting on with their large new cohort of councillors, with figures going round that between May and November the party has lost around 5% of its councillor base to resignation or defection.  This comes to around 40 councillors, but don't let the reporting here fool you.  Those losses have been more than made up for by Reform UK by-election gains since May, and defection gains on top of that mean that the party's council base continues to grow overall.
</p><p>
Long Eaton North comes into this category after Reform UK's Jack Bradley, who was elected here in May and had been the county council's cabinet member for the important portfolio of education, special educational needs and disabilities, handed in his notice in October for personal reasons which are understood to be related to his health.  His short tenure in the top job included announcing the closure of five adult education centres without public consultation.  A further Reform UK Derbyshire county councillor has recently stood down on health grounds, and we will back in the county in the New Year to cover the resulting by-election.
</p><p>
In the meantime the defending Reform UK candidate in the Long Eaton North by-election is Owen Ferron, a local businessman who is standing for election for the first time.  Just to confound any stereotype which might be entering your head right now, Ferron is the only non-white candidate on this ballot.  Labour have reselected George Carr-Williamson, who stood here in May and finished as runner-up: Carr-Williamson is a long-serving Labour Party staffer who was appointed OBE in the 2022 Birthday Honours for his political service.  The Conservatives' Dan Pitt is an academic who specialises in the history of his party, and he also has an electoral track record here as a former Erewash councillor for Derby Road West ward.  Also on the Long Eaton North ballot are Samuel Briggs for the Liberal Democrats, Mell Catori for the Green Party, and Cheryl Pidgeon who has a long electoral history.  Pidgeon has previously served as a Labour member of Derbyshire county council (for Sawley division from a July 2011 by-election to 2013) and Erewash council (Nottingham Road ward, 2011-15), and she has stood three times for Parliament as a Labour candidate (contesting Erewash in 2010, South Derbyshire in 2015 and Rushcliffe in 2019), but she is now an independent member of Sawley parish council and she is standing here as the first election candidate for the Derbyshire Community Party, which was previously registered with the Electoral Commission under the name of "Belper Independents".
