<blockquote>
"All the right votes, but not necessarily in the right order"
</blockquote>
</p><p>
Five by-elections on 13th November 2025:
</p><p>
<h2>Long Ashton</h2>
</p><p>
<em>North Somerset council; caused by the resignation of Green Party councillor Stuart McQuillan.</em>
</p><p>
Every Bristolian and many visitors to that city will be familiar with the Clifton Suspension Bridge, which opened in 1864 and towers almost 250 feet above the Avon gorge.  It's a landmark for the city and it appears on every postcard.  On the right bank of the bridge is the upmarket Bristol suburb of Clifton; but today we're going to pay the £1 toll to cross to the left bank and arrive at the Somerset village of Leigh Woods, which was more or less created by the bridge as an upmarket Bristol commuter centre.
</p><p>
Leigh Woods is part of the parish of Long Ashton, but it is cut off from the village of that name by the open space of the Ashton Court estate.  This was originally the grounds of a rambling mansion house called Ashton Court, which is now mostly derelict and on the Heritage at Risk register.  Ashton Court was owned for the centuries by the Smyth family of Bristol merchants, before it was sold to Bristol city council in 1959 to pay death duties.  Much of the estate has been annexed by Bristol over the years to build suburbs like Ashton Gate, but the house itself and the remaining parts of the estate lie outside the city boundary.
</p><p>
The village of Long Ashton itself is bypassed by the main road from Bristol city centre towards Weston-super-Mare.  The A4174 Bristol ring road terminates on this bypass, close to the Long Ashton park and ride site which has its own dedicated bus route to Spike Island and the city centre.  All this has turned Long Ashton into a commuter village for the city, but the main industry here was traditionally agriculture.  Until its closure in 2003 the Long Ashton Research Station was located here, doing government-funded research into agriculture and horticulture with a particular focus on fruit; one lasting product of this research is the fruit drink Ribena, which was developed here in the 1930s.
</p><p>
The Long Ashton electoral ward also includes the parish of Wraxall and Failand to the west, which covers those two villages plus part of the town of Nailsea which has expanded over the parish boundary.  The villages of Wraxall and Failand are divided from each other by the Tyntesfield estate, which is based on another large country house.  Tyntesfield house is named after the Tynte baronets who lived here until 1843, but it reached its full Gothic Revival splendour in the 19th century under the ownership of William Gibbs.
</p><p>
In an illustration of the old adage that where there's muck there's brass, Gibbs had become extremely wealthy thanks to his company's monopoly on the Peruvian guano trade, and he initially bought Tyntesfield as a base for his frequent business trips to Bristol.  Guano was much in demand in Europe as fertiliser, and Gibbs' firm Antony Gibbs and Sons used indentured Chinese labour to extract the guano deposits from Peruvian islands in near-slave conditions.  The company later pivoted to insurance, and it became part of the HSBC empire in 1981; the Tyntesfield house was bought by the National Trust in 2002 following the death of William Gibbs' great-grandson Richard Gibbs, and it has been open to the public since then.  Until 1999 Richard Gibbs had sat in the House of Lords as the second Lord Wraxall, a hereditary title originally granted to his father George Gibbs who had been the Conservative MP for Bristol West from 1918 to 1928.
</p><p>
George Gibbs would probably look at modern election results in this area with some bemusement.  The local authority here is North Somerset council which has been under no overall control since 2019; the 2023 election returned another balanced council with 13 Conservative councillors, 10 Labour, 9 Lib Dems, 8 independents, 7 Greens and 3 councillors elected on the Portishead Independents ticket.  A subsequent November 2023 by-election in Wrington ward saw the Green Party gain a seat from an independent councillor.  The Liberal Democrats lead a rainbow anti-Conservative coalition.
</p><p>
The North Somerset parliamentary seat only covers the northern half of the North Somerset council area, because the district's main town Weston-super-Mare is a constituency of its own and the Wells and Mendip Hills constituency also includes territory from this district.  The North Somerset constituency returned a Labour MP last year for the first time in its history, as the former defence and international trade secretary Sir Liam Fox went down to defeat after 32 years in the Commons.  Fox was replaced by Labour's Sadik al-Hassan, who was a pharmacist before his election to Parliament.  Al-Hassan has a slim majority of 639 votes.
</p><p>
Finishing third in the North Somerset constituency in 2024 was the Lib Dem candidate Ash Cartman, who since 2019 has been one of the two councillors for Long Ashton ward along with the Green Party's Stuart McQuillan.  Topline vote shares here in 2023 were 35% for the Lib Dems, 31% for the Green Party and 25% for the Conservatives, although this is rather skewed by the Lib Dems and Greens effectively having a joint slate.  Cartman now appears to be an independent councillor, although confusingly he is still part of the "Lib Dem and Independent" council group.  He quit the Liberal Democrats after North Somerset council voted to approve a development in the ward by the American healthcare software firm Epic Systems, which is intended to be on an epic scale with a 90-acre technology campus and the creation of 2,000 jobs.  It would fill in the green belt between Bristol and Long Ashton.
</p><p>
The Green Party are defending this by-election after Stuart McQuillan tendered his resignation in September: he is moving away from the district.  Their defending candidate Mike Dunn is a self-employed researcher and designer who sits on Long Ashton parish council.  The Liberal Democrats' Françoise Johnston was an unsuccessful candidate in the 2023 North Somerset elections when she contested Portishead North ward.  Standing for the Conservatives is James Gillham, who used to run the constituency office for Sir Liam Fox and subsequently worked on Robert Jenrick's unsuccessful campaign for the party leadership.  Labour's Ian Ridge and Reform UK's James Read complete the candidate list for Long Ashton.

<h2>Ridgeway</h2>
</p><p>
<em>Vale of White Horse council, Oxfordshire; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Paul Barrow.</em>
</p><p>
We now travel east to a ward which mostly lies within the North Wessex Downs National Landscape.  The name of Ridgeway ward refers to the Ridgeway, a prehistoric trackway which ran along high ground from Salisbury Plain to the River Thames at Goring Gap.  Its modern successor, the Ridgeway National Trail, continues along the Chiltern ridgeline to Ivinghoe Beacon in Buckinghamshire for a total hike of 87 miles.
</p><p>
The Ridgeway ward covers seven parishes on the northern slopes of the Berkshire downs, located to the west of Wantage and to the east of the Uffington White Horse which gives its name to the district.  The largest centre of population here with 967 electors on the roll is East Challow, which can be found just to the west of Wantage on the road towards Faringdon.  Up in the hills is the village of Letcombe Regis, which like Long Ashton earlier was once a centre for agricultural research: until its closure in 2003 the Letcombe Laboratory worked successively on contamination of agricultural land by atomic products from atmospheric nuclear tests, on plant root systems, and finally (in the private sector from 1985) on crop fungicide research.
</p><p>
The Liberal Democrats represent this area at both district and parliamentary level.  The Didcot and Wantage parliamentary seat was created by the 2024 redistribution and it returned Lib Dem MP Olly Glover, who came to the Commons from a career in railway operations.  The Ridgeway ward had been represented since 2019 by Lib Dem councillor Paul Barrow, who gained his seat from the Conservatives by just five votes in 2019 and was re-elected in 2023 by the more comfortable margin of 186 votes, or in percentage terms 58-42 in a straight fight.  Vale of White Horse council is a Tory-free zone, with the 2023 elections returning 34 Lib Dem councillors and 4 Greens.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2023/vale-wh23s.svgz" alt="Vale of White Horse, 2023" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
The Oxfordshire county council elections in May saw a more mixed picture here, partly thanks to a longer ballot paper giving more voter choice.  Five of the seven parishes which make up Ridgeway ward are part of the Shrivenham county division, which the Green Party narrowly gained from the Conservatives.  Meanwhile, boundary changes moved the parishes of East Challow and West Challow to the new Wantage West county division which was easily won by the Lib Dems.
</p><p>
The outgoing Lib Dem councillor Paul Barrow was diagnosed with cancer in 2019.  He is a professor of veterinary medicine and science at the University of Surrey, and he is intending to retire to Suffolk - where his son has a veterinary practice - while he is still well enough to organise the move.
</p><p>
Defending this seat for the Lib Dems is Hannah Griffin, who manages IT teams at the Harwell scientific campus; she was an unsuccessful candidate for Oxfordshire county council in May in Kingston and Stanford division, but this is her home turf.  She lives in Letcombe Regis as does the Conservative candidate Charlotte Dickson, who was previously a Vale councillor for Wantage Charlton ward from 2011 to 2019 and tried unsuccessfully to get her seat in that ward back in 2023.  Also standing are Kiera Barnett for the Green Party; Labour's Rob Blundell, who lives in Abingdon and stood in Abingdon North in May's county council elections; and Reform UK's Henry de Kretser, who was their county council candidate for Wantage West in May.

<h2>Wincheap</h2>
</p><p>
<em>Canterbury council, Kent; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Roben Franklin.</em>
</p><p>
Our final by-election today in the south of England takes us to Kent.  Wincheap is the main road heading south-west from Canterbury city centre up the Great Stour Valley towards Ashford.  It's now part of the A28 road, and it has given its name to this south-western suburb of Canterbury.  This was the area where the Protestant Canterbury Martyrs were burned at the stake between 1555 and 1558, during the reign of Mary I; the location is marked by a monument on Martyrs Field Road.
</p><p>
Canterbury East railway station, which links Canterbury with the Medway Towns and Dover, lies on the northern boundary of Wincheap ward.  Beyond the A2 bypass this ward also takes in the parish of Thanington, previously known as Thanington Without, which is clearly scheduled for major development in the near future.
</p><p>
This area is part of the Canterbury parliamentary seat, which was a very surprising gain for Labour MP Rosie Duffield in the 2017 general election.  Duffield's majority then was 187 votes, but in July 2024 she was re-elected for her third term of office with a huge lead of 8,653 votes over the Conservatives.  Three months later, she quit the Labour party and she is sitting as an independent MP.
</p><p>
Duffield has had a stormy relationship with the national Labour party, particularly over the issue of transgender rights, but this doesn't seem to have stopped the Canterbury Labour branch from turning into a pretty formidable campaigning unit.  As well as Duffield's large majority in 2024, evidence for this comes from Labour becoming the largest party on Canterbury council in the 2023 elections: seat totals at that election were 18 Labour, 9 Lib Dems, 8 Conservatives and 4 Greens, and Labour lead a coalition with the Lib Dems which currently runs the show.  In addition, the two Canterbury City divisions were the only Kent county council divisions to return Labour candidates at the 2025 county elections.  Wincheap ward is partly within the Labour-held Canterbury City South division and partly within the Canterbury South division which voted strongly for the Lib Dems in May.
</p><p>
This political split was also seen at the last Canterbury elections in Wincheap ward, which had previously been Lib Dem with Labour in second place.  Vote shares here in 2023 were 38% for Labour, 36% for the Lib Dems and 15% for the Green Party, with Labour and the Lib Dems sharing the two seats: this was a Labour gain of one seat.
</p><p>
So we might have a rare opportunity for Labour to gain a seat in this by-election, which is to replace Lib Dem councillor Roben Franklin following his resignation in September.  Franklin is now based in Surrey, and his LinkedIn shows him as having taken up a new role as a campaign organiser for the Lib Dems' Tandridge branch who have had some success in local by-elections over the last month.
</p><p>
Defending this seat for the Lib Dems is Guy Meurice, a Thanington parish councillor who works as a web developer.  The Labour candidate is Jasmin Dallos-Foreman, who stood in May as their county council candidate for Canterbury South; according to the excellent website <a href="https://whocanivotefor.co.uk">whocanivotefor.co.uk</a>, her favourite biscuits are chocolate hobnobs.  The Green Party's Peter Campbell will be hoping for a better return than the 3% he polled in a by-election last March for Herne and Broomfield ward; in May he was the Green candidate for Canterbury City North.  Also on the ballot are the Conservatives' Elliot Curryer and Reform UK's Colin Spooner, a former Conservative Canterbury councillor (Seasalter ward, 2015-19) who was runner-up to the Lib Dems in Canterbury South in May.  Counting for this by-election will commence at 11am on Friday.

<h2>Chapel St Leonards</h2>
</p><p>
<em>East Lindsey council, Lincolnshire; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Stephen Evans.</em>
</p><p>
We now cross to the seaside at Chapel St Leonards, a minor resort on the Lincolnshire coast about five miles north of Skegness.  The beach is sandy, the amusements are tacky and, if the weather holds, there are nice views out to sea to watch what the birds are doing.  Chapel St Leonards has become a favoured place for migrating birds, and for the birdwatchers who observe them.  Playing on these themes is the North Sea Observatory, a modern visitor centre (est 2018) which is described as the UK's first marine observatory.
</p><p>
When we change our gaze to look inland at the sort of people who live in Chapel St Leonards, a theme quickly starts to emerge.  In the 2021 census this ward was in the top 20 in England and Wales for the 65-84 age bracket at 38.1% of residents, and just 27% of the population were aged under 45.  For comparison, the median age of a person living in England is 40, according to the most recent estimates.  Possibly connected with this, a massive 38% of the population have no qualifications, which is the eighth-highest figure in England and Wales; the neighbouring Ingoldmells ward came in at number 1 on this statistic, just beating the ward which covers the notorious quasi-shanty town of Jaywick in Essex.  46% of the population are retired, which is in the top 40 wards in England and Wales.  The words "elephant's graveyard" would not be inappropriate to describe Chapel St Leonards.  For those here who are young enough to work, the demographic skews to the working-class end.
</p><p>
When this column last wrote about Chapel St Leonards in January 2022, I remarked that "it would be difficult to imagine a more Conservative-voting demographic".  How times have changed - and here this remark isn't just a break with the future, but also with the past.
</p><p>
East Lindsey is one of England's more remote local government districts, and it had a majority of independent councillors until 2003.  The Conservatives only really started standing in Chapel St Leonards at the 2007 election, when they won one out of two seats; but that seat went back to the independents in 2011.
</p><p>
One long-serving independent councillor for Chapel St Leonards was Philip Leivers, who back in the 1970s had been the manager of the Hammersmith Odeon (now the Hammersmith Apollo) in London.  In 2013 Leivers was charged with a number of sex offences against a child dating from the period when he was managing that theatre, and he resigned from East Lindsey council.  In July 2014 a jury at Snaresbrook Crown Court convicted Leivers of three counts of indecency towards a child, but they were unable to reach a verdict on some other charges.  The Crown initially sought a retrial, but this fell through after Leivers' victim suddenly died; this caused Leivers' sentencing hearing to be delayed to March 2015, and he was sent to prison for four and a half years.
</p><p>
The by-election in October 2013 to replace Philip Leivers as an East Lindsey councillor saw a freak vote split, with Labour - standing here for the first time in ten years - winning with a large majority but just 33% of the vote.  The Labour councillor then lost her seat in 2015, with the Conservatives winning both seats in Chapel St Leonards for the first time this century.  The ward's two Conservative councillors, Paul Hibbert-Greaves and Mel Turton-Leivers (no relation of Philip Leivers), were then re-elected in 2019 with a 57-43 margin over Labour.
</p><p>
Neither of them made it to the end of their term.  Mel Turton-Leivers resigned from the council in 2020, and the resulting by-election was delayed to May 2021 by the COVID-19 pandemic.  It was contested by a localist group called the Skegness Urban District Society, despite the fact that this area has never been part of Skegness Urban District.  The SUDS had one candidate in the Chapel St Leonards by-election and, due to what appears to be a nomination error, two candidates for one seat in the local Lincolnshire county council division of Ingoldmells Rural - one of whom also stood as an independent candidate for the Chapel St Leonards by-election in opposition to the official SUDS candidate.  Confused?  You will be.  The electors were clearly not impressed by all this, and the resulting by-election was a big win for the new Conservative candidate who enjoyed a 67-17 lead over Labour.  Paul Hibbert-Greaves then died five months later, and the resulting by-election in January 2022 was won by the Conservatives by 62-38 in a straight fight with an independent candidate.
</p><p>
In 2023 the Conservatives lost their majority on East Lindsey council, winning 26 seats to 16 independents, 6 Labour, 5 councillors for the Skegness Urban District Society, a Green councillor, and a Lib Dem who was elected despite the party polling zero votes across the district: the Lib Dems only had one candidate in the 2023 East Lindsey elections, and she was elected unopposed in Horncastle ward.  The Conservatives continue to run East Lindsey as a minority administration, while the Skegness Urban District Society have now disbanded.  They have lost the argument: the clear trend in local government at the moment is for less localism, not more.
</p><p>
Five East Lindsey councillors have since joined the banner of Reform UK, who have performed well in elections here since 2023.  Chapel St Leonards is part of the Boston and Skegness parliamentary seat which was won in 2024 by Richard Tice, who had previously been a Brexit Party MEP for the East of England from 2019 to 2020.  Tice is now the deputy leader of Reform UK.  That party then went on to gain the Ingoldmells Rural county division from the Conservatives in 2025 very comfortably indeed.
</p><p>
Which gives the Conservatives a problem in defending this by-election.  In 2023 they lost one of the two seats in Chapel St Leonards ward to Labour in a rather close three-way result: topline vote shares were 36% for the Conservatives, 33% for Labour and 31% for an independent candidate.  The remaining Conservative councillor, the 2022 by-election winner Stephen Evans, stood down in September for personal reasons.
</p><p>
Defending this seat for the Conservatives is Alan Vassar, who is seeking to return to East Lindsey council after some years away: Vassar previously sat for the neighbouring Willoughby with Sloothby ward from 2015 to 2019.  Labour, who hold Chapel St Leonards ward's other seat, have selected Carole Clark who gives an address in the village of Addlethorpe to the south; she contested Winthorpe ward in 2023, and she stood in Boston North in May's Lincolnshire county elections.  The independent candidate from 2023 is not standing again but two new independents have come forward: Jason Boswell is an Ingoldmells parish councillor who runs a pub in Skegness, and in 2023 he was the Skegness Urban District Society candidate for Ingoldmells ward; while Valerie Worley lives in the village of Hogsthorpe which is part of Chapel St Leonards ward.  Reform UK have selected Paul Sutton, who lives in Ingoldmells and was last seen on a ballot paper as a Skegness Urban District Society candidate in 2023; he completes the candidate list for this by-election along with David Tucker for the Lib Dems.

<h2>Bethel a'r Felinheli</h2>
</p><p>
<em>Gwynedd council, Wales; caused by the resignation of Plaid Cymru councillor Iwan Huws.</em>
</p><p>
We have now reached the second week in November, and if you have been reading Andrew's Previews for some years you will know what that means.  It is now time to climb the stairs into the pulpit and to read out the following notice.
</p><p>
The six-month rule is now in effect ahead of the scheduled local elections on 7th May 2026.  In England, these elections will be for all the councillors in the 32 London boroughs, and for one-third or one-half of councillors in those English boroughs and districts which elect by thirds.  We will also see elections for the whole council in a few areas which have unusual electoral cycles - these are Birmingham, Huntingdonshire, Newcastle-under-Lyme, St Helens and South Cambridgeshire - plus the county council, Isle of Wight and Thurrock council elections which were postponed from last year, plus (assuming that the paperwork is sorted out in time) elections to the two new local councils in Surrey which will take up their responsibilities in April 2027.  There will also be whole-council elections in some areas where new ward boundaries are coming in: this includes 14 of the 36 Metropolitan Boroughs, because the Local Government Boundary Commission have recently concluded reviews of all metropolitan boroughs which haven't had ward boundary changes since 2004.  (Plus Newcastle upon Tyne, where the last boundary review was botched.)  We will also see mayoral elections in the boroughs of Croydon, Hackney, Lewisham, Newham, Tower Hamlets and Watford, and possibly some new combined authority mayors.
</p><p>
The effect of the six-month rule is that no more by-elections will be held to renew councillors and other elected representatives who were due for re-election in May 2026: any vacancies in those seats will be left vacant until the ordinary election.  This means in particular that we have now seen our last local by-elections in the London Boroughs until next summer at the earliest, because there are currently no outstanding vacancies in those councils.  By-elections can continue to be held to fill vacancies for terms ending in 2027 or later.
</p><p>
The six-month rule also applies to any further constituency vacancies in the Scottish Parliament and in Senedd Cymru, which are both due for re-election in May 2026.  We will not see any further by-elections to Senedd Cymru going forward, because electoral reform is coming to Cardiff Bay next year: the Senedd will be expanded from 60 seats to 96, elected by proportional representation from 16 six-member constituencies.  Any future vacant seats in the Welsh Parliament will be filled from the party list, as currently happens with regional MSs.
</p><p>
These new Senedd constituencies have been constructed by pairing off Wales' 32 Westminster constituencies, so (for example) the Westminster seats of Dwyfor Meirionnydd, and Montgomeryshire and Glyndŵr have been combined into the Senedd constituency of Gwynedd Maldwyn.  If we aggregate the votes cast in those Westminster constituencies in July 2024, then under proportional representation the notional result would be two seats each for Plaid Cymru (33%) and Labour (22%), and one each for Reform UK (16%) and the Conservatives (15%).
</p><p>
Most of the Plaid Cymru vote in the new seat will come out of the Dwyfor Meirionnydd constituency, which covers most of the Gwynedd council area and is currently represented by Plaid in both Parliaments.  Its Westminster MP Liz Saville Roberts is the leader of the Plaid Cymru group in the House of Commons.
</p><p>
The outgoing Dwyfor Meirionnydd Senedd constituency is based on the pre-2024 Westminster boundaries and is extremely undersized.  It doesn't include the Bethel a'r Felinheli ward, which lies on the south bank of the Menai Strait between Bangor and Caernarfon, because this ward is currently in the Arfon Senedd constituency based on Bangor.  That seat has been represented since 2016 by Siân Gwenllian, who is a former deputy leader of the party.  Gwenllian is to seek re-election next year at the top of Plaid Cymru's list for Gwynedd Maldwyn, with the present Dwyfor Meirionnydd MS Mabon ap Gwynfor in second place.
</p><p>
Before she was elected to the Senedd in 2016, Siân Gwenllian was the Gwynedd councillor for Y Felinheli on the banks of the Menai.  In the Welsh language "y" is the definite article (more on this later) and "melin" (here in its mutated form "felin") is the word for "mill", while the "heli" part of the name has been interpreted as a reference either to saltwater or to the Afon Heulyn, a river which flows into the Menai here.  The former English-language name of this settlement was completely different: sufficiently old atlases referred to the village as "Port Dinorwic", because industrial development in the 19th century saw a harbour built here at the end of a narrow-gauge railway from the Dinorwic slate quarry near Llanberis.  The railway is long gone and the harbour is now a marina for pleasure boating.

Gwynedd council has a Plaid Cymru majority and a serious problem with uncontested elections: a proposal last year to move Gwynedd council elections to proportional representation, which would have solved this problem, fell one vote short of the required two-thirds majority of councillors.  Gwenllian served as a Gwynedd councillor for eight years without a single vote being cast for her, because she was returned unopposed in both 2008 and 2012 as the only candidate for Y Felinheli ward.  She resigned from Gwynedd council upon her election to the Senedd, and the resulting by-election in July 2016 gives us some idea of what might have happened had those elections been contested: the Plaid Cymru candidate Gareth Griffith beat a Conservative candidate by the resounding score of 93-7.  Griffith was re-elected unopposed at the 2017 Gwynedd election a year later.  Plaid Cymru support is strongly correlated with use of the Welsh language, and Y Felinheli has some of the highest rates of Welsh-speaking residents anywhere.
</p><p>
Boundary changes for the 2022 Gwynedd election merged this ward with the former Bethel ward to the south.  Like Chapel St Leonards, this settlement has a religious name derived from a chapel: ultimately the Bethel name comes from the Bible, where the city of Bethel is mentioned in several books of the Old Testament.  The Bethel of the Holy Land is identified with the modern Arab village of Beitin in the West Bank, and history records that during the First Jewish-Roman War it was was captured by the Roman emperor Vespasian in the summer of 69.  Oh yeah.
</p><p>
Bethel had returned Labour councillor Sion Jones in 2012 and 2017, but Jones stood down in 2022 and no new Labour candidate stood to replace him.  For the new two-seat ward of Bethel a'r Felinheli ("Bethel and Y Felinheli": the Welsh definite article changes to 'r after a word ending in a vowel) Plaid Cymru put up a slate of two new candidates, Sasha Williams and Iwan Huws, who polled 84% of the vote against competition from a single Liberal Democrat candidate.
</p><p>
The outgoing councillor Iwan Huws is apparently notable enough for English (but not Welsh) Wikipedia.  He stood in the 2011 elections for what was then called the Welsh Assembly as the Plaid Cymru candidate for Aberconwy, finishing second to the Conservatives, and he has previously been chief executive of the Snowdonia National Park Authority and the Welsh director of the National Trust.  He's also Siân Gwenllian's brother.  This by-election might be one for the Councillors Behaving Badly file, because the Adjudication Panel for Wales - which investigates complaints against Welsh councillors - has a tribunal hearing pending to determine whether Huws has broken paragraph 6(1)(a) of the Welsh councillors' code of conduct, which relates to bringing the office of councillor or the council into disrepute.  Quite what provoked this isn't clear to your columnist at the time of writing.
</p><p>
The candidate list has also revealed a split on the Plaid Cymru side.  The defending Plaid candidate is Gwion Emyr, who lives in Y Felinheli and works in the broadcasting industry.  He might be given a run for his money by independent candidate Kelly O'Donnell, who is the chair of Neuadd Goffa Bethel (the Bethel Memorial Hall) which is also Bethel's polling station.  Welsh local election candidates have to declare political party memberships held in the last year, and according to the statement of persons nominated O'Donnell is a Plaid Cymru member, or at least she was when her nomination papers went in.  Also standing are two candidates who turned up at the last Gwynedd by-election in faraway Abermaw (Barmouth) without success: they are Terry Temple for Reform UK and Hedd Thomas for the Conservatives.
