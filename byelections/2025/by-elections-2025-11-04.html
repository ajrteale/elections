Two by-elections on Tuesday 4th November 2025:

<h2>Lanehead; and<br>
Queensgate</h2>

Burrnley council, Lancashire; caused respectively by the resignations of Labour councillors Fiona Wild and Syeda Kazmi.

I'll tell you now and I'll tell you firmly<br>
I don't ever want to go to Burrnley<br>
What they do there don't concern me<br>
Why would anybody make the journey?

November is shaping up to be a busy month for Andrew's Previews, with 25 by-elections currently in the diary.  So, notwithstanding the wise words of the Bard of Salford, let's make an early start to this month by going to Burrnley.

There are two wards up for election here today, which adjoin each other in the north of the town.  Queensgate ward lies along the main road going north out of the town centre towards Colne, and its ward boundaries take in Burrnley General Hospital and the, er, Pendle Sports Village.  Lanehead ward is immediately to the east of Queensgate ward across Eastern Avenue and Briercliffe Road, and it takes in much of the large Heasandford industrial estate together with a large secondary school, the Sir John Thursby Community College.  The eponymous Thursby was a 19th-century military officer who became a rich man thanks to his ownership of the Hargreaves Collieries group which controlled much of the Burrnley coalfield, and much of his wealth was given to the town in the form of public works.

Unusually for Burrnley, which is a very racially- and religiously-segregated town, Lanehead and Queensgate wards are socially mixed.  In the 2021 census Queensgate ward was 47% White British and 39% Asian (38% Muslim), while the figures for Lanehead were 66% White British and 26% Asian (25% Muslim); compare these figures with neighbouring wards like Brunshaw (94% White British) or Daneshouse with Stoneyholme (78% Asian).  Queensgate ward, which is strongly working-class, makes the top 80 wards in England and Wales for terraced housing, at 60.3% of households, and the 20 wards for residents working in the wholesale and retail sector (25.8%).  Lanehead ward is also working-class, if not quite to the same extent as Queensgate.

Burrnley council has been under no overall control since 2019 and politically it is a right old mess.  If we add up the results of the 2022 to 2024 local elections here we end up with 21 seats for Labour, 7 each for the Conservatives and Lib Dems, 5 Greens, 2 seats for the Burrnley and Padiham Independent Party (which is now defunct), and three independents.  The actual council composition doesn't bear much resemblance to these figures at all: the latest figures have 13 Labour councillors plus these two vacancies, 9 councillors in the Burrnley Independent Group, 7 Conservatives, 7 Lib Dems, 5 Greens and 2 Reform UK councillors.

The reason for this is the so-called Gaza Independent phenomenon, which has taken hold in East Lancashire in a big way.  Shortly before the 2024 local elections the Labour group in Burrnley split down the middle, with the group leader and council leader Afrasiab Anwar leading the breakaway: Anwar has kept his position as Leader of the Council and he has formed a coalition of independent, Lib Dem and Green councillors to keep the municipal show on the road.

The breakaway included all three councillors for Queensgate ward, which had been in Labour hands since 2012 and where Labour had had a 69-13 lead over the Conservatives in May 2023, before all this blew up.  The May 2024 result in Queensgate ended up being quite the turnaround, as the independent group's candidate Aurangzeb Ali trounced the new Labour candidate by 69-20.

The independents also put up a strong challenge in Lanehead ward, where the outgoing ex-Labour councillor Asif Raja sought re-election under his new political colours: but he ended up losing his seat very narrowly to the new Labour candidate Andy Waddington, who won with 715 votes to Raja's 712.  In percentage terms Labour and Raja both scored 42%.  One wonders whether the Conservatives, who had also put up a Muslim candidate, might have split the community's vote and allowed Labour to come through the middle; stranger electoral things have happened in East Lancashire.  Anyway, this result preserves the Labour winning streak in Lanehead ward, which goes back to 2011.

The Gaza Independent vote here has not gone away since May 2024, as we can see from May's Lancashire county council results.  Both Lanehead and Queensgate wards are part of the Burrnley North East county division, where the outgoing Labour county councillor Usman Arif sought re-election as an independent candidate and romped home.  Shares of the vote across the county division, which also takes in part of Bank Hall ward, were 59% for Arif and 22% for Reform UK, with Labour - who were notionally defending the seat - trailing in third on just 9%.

The Lib Dems didn't contest either Lanehead or Queensgate ward in 2024, and they are not standing in either of these by-elections, but they did regularly win both wards until the Coalition years.  Lanehead ward has also previously voted for the far-right, as it was won by the British National Party in May 2003; but the BNP councillor resigned four months later after being suspneded from the party for getting into a fight with one of Nick Griffin's minders, and the Lib Dems gained the resulting by-election in October 2003.

The losing Labour candidate in that by-election was Julie Cooper, who went on to serve as Burrnley's Labour MP from 2015 to 2019.  The Burrnley constituency has voted for all three main Westminster parties in the last 15 years, having returned Antony Higginbotham for the Conservatives in 2019 and Gordon Birtwistle for the Lib Dems in 2010.  Higginbotham sought re-election in July 2024 but finished in third place behind Labour and Birtwistle, who appears to have picked up much of the Gaza independent vote in this constituency as a result of there being no Gaza independent on the ballot.

But that wasn't enough for Birtwistle to return to the Commons, and the Burrnley seat went to the Labour candidate Oliver Ryan last year.  Ryan had previously been a Tameside councillor, representing Audenshaw ward from 2014 to 2023, and that history came back to bite him this year: Ryan was suspended from the Labour whip in February 2025 for being part of the notorious "Trigger Me Timbers" bad-taste WhatsApp group, but he is now back in the fold.

Bad-taste social media has also generated the Lanehead ward by-election, which is to replace Fiona Wild.  In September she posted an instant Facebook reaction to the asassination of the US right-wing political activist Charlie Kirk which included the words "good riddance" and "brought this on himself", a post which even on the most charitable of readings fell into the category of "too soon".  Having posted in haste, Wild is now repenting at leisure: the blowback from this was such that she submitted her resignation from the council.  Wild was in her first term on the council, having been first elected in 2023.

No such scandal attaches to the resignation later in September of Queensgate ward councillor Syeda Kazmi, who was elected for Labour in 2022 but joined the exodus from the party last year.  In the July 2024 general election Kazmi stood for Parliament in Bolton North East, as the candidate of George Galloway's Workers Party of Britain.  I'm afraid I can't remember her making an impression on me.

The split in Burrnley Labour has resulted in the rump Labour group consisting entirely of White British councillors, and both Labour candidates for these by-elections are in that vein.  Hoping to win Queensgate ward back is Dylan Rea, who is the landlord of a pub in Burrnley town centre; in May's county elections Rea stood in Burrnley Central West under his previous name of Dylan Manning.  There are two independent candidates who will both be hoping to pick up the Gaza vote: judging from social media it looks like the council's ruling independent group are campaigning for Musharaf Parvez who is fighting his first election campaign, while Javad Mokhammad stood in May's county elections in Burrnley Central East and got nowhere.  Also on the Queensgate ballot are Susan Nutter for the Conservatives (who previously stood here in 2018), Victoria Fletcher for Reform UK and Janet Hall for the Green Party.

Labour start in a stronger position for their defence of Lanehead ward, which is less susceptible to the wilder electoral effects of East Lancashire Asian politics.  Here the defending Labour candidate is Millie Towers, who is a student reading for a masters degree in public policy at Lancaster University.  The independent candidate here is local resident Shiraz Ahmed who is fighting his first campaign.  Dale Ferrier for the Conservatives, Affan Burki for the Greens and Reform UK's Gavin Theaker complete the candidate list in Lanehead.
