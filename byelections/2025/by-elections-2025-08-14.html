Two by-elections on 14th August 2025:
</p><p>
<h2>South Jesmond</h2>
</p><p>
<em>Newcastle upon Tyne council, Tyne and Wear; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Milo Barnett.</em>
</p><p>
Last week we had three polls which were all in the same kind of area - former coalfield communities in England and Wales - and they all had the same end result with wins for those new kids on the political block Reform UK.  This week's set is also rather homogeneous, with both seats up for election today being in strongly left-wing wards on the edges of major city centres.  Both of these wards have been affected, in different ways, by election reforms introduced by the last Conservative government, and it's worth taking some time in this week's Previews to see what those problems have been and what the new Labour administration intend to do about them.
</p><p>

</p><p>
Before we come to the English ward up for election today, let me point you to the official UK government portal for registering to vote: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/register-to-vote">www.gov.uk/register-to-vote</a>.  This is the landing page for a series of forms which promise to take about five minutes to fill out, and you will need to do this once when you are 16 (or 14, if you live in Scotland or Wales) and then every time you change your name, address or nationality.  Once you have filled this form in and your local council's electoral registration office have added you to the register, then you are on the list indefinitely: you don't have to go through all this over and over again every time there's an election in your area.
</p><p>
There's a lot of thought and hard work which has gone into this form, and not just for the backend which has to check then all the details are fine and pass the information to your local electoral registration office for them to implement.  The overall design is also worth a mention.  In 2013, which was gov.uk's first full year of operation, the site won the "Design of the Year" award from the Design Museum, with the jury praising its "well thought out, yet understated design".
</p><p>
One aspect of this design which has not changed since 2013 is that gov.uk uses only one typeface for all of its text.  All of the hundreds of government departments and agencies under the gov.uk umbrella use the font "New Transport", an update by designers Henrik Kubel and Margaret Calvert for the digital era of the "Transport" typeface which has been standard on all UK road signs since 1965.
</p><p>
The presence of Margaret Calvert as a co-developer of New Transport is extremely appropriate, because Calvert - who is now in her late 80s - was one of the designers of the original Transport all those years ago.  In the mid-1950s she was studying at the Chelsea College of Art when her tutor, Jock Kinneir, won a commission to design the signs for Gatwick Airport; he asked her to work on this project with him.  Out of this came work on new luggage labels for the P&O shipping line, whose chairman Colin Anderson was then asked by the government to chair the committee designing signs for Britain's first motorways which were about to open.  Anderson gave the job to Kinneir and Calvert, who designed the Transport font to a specific brief for a direction sign that could easily be read at motorway speeds.
</p><p>
The duo went on to comprehensively redesign the UK's signs for all-purpose roads, and most of their designs - including the Transport font - remain in use today with little modification.  (The young girl depicted in the "children crossing" sign is a self-portrait of Calvert.)  The Transport font itself has been exported all over the world, with several countries in Europe and Asia - including countries such as Greece, the UAE and India whose languages are not in the Latin script - using modified versions of Transport for their own road signs.
</p><p>
In 1971 Calvert was commissioned to create a new seriffed typeface for St Quentin-en-Yvelines, a New Town near Paris which was then under construction.  The French ended up rejecting the typeface for being "too English", but it was then taken up as the official font of the Tyne and Wear Metro, a scheme to revitalise the old Tyneside Electrics suburban railway network with new underground lines to serve central Newcastle and Gateshead.  Last year Nexus, the operating company for the Metro, invited Calvert to Newcastle for her to inspect what it had done with her work.

</p><p>
Jesmond station, which lies at the northern end of the central underground section, was one of the first Metro stations to open in 1980.  It's located just to the north of Newcastle city centre, not far outside the curious 1960s throwback of the Central Motorway East.  Originally part of the A1(M) and now numbered A167(M), this was the only part of an aggressive urban motorway network for Newcastle that ever got off the ground.  And I mean that literally: there is so little space here that the two carriageways are stacked one on top of the other, and the junctions with the A1058 Jesmond Road and the B1318 Great North Road - major arterial roads going east and north from the city centre - are both a tangle of tightly-curved viaducts.  Each September the motorway is closed to traffic and opened to half-marathon runners, as it lies within the first couple of miles of the Great North Run.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/newcastle-tyne-s-jesmond-2025.webp" alt="Newcastle (Tyne), S Jesmond" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
South Jesmond ward runs north-east from the Central Motorway East along the Jesmond Road, taking in the Sandyford area to the east of the city centre together with the southern end of Jesmond around Osborne Road.  Jesmond was traditionally a very affluent suburb of Newcastle, as can be seen from the presence here of a number of fee-paying schools (including the Royal Grammar School which traces its history to the 16th century) and the Mansion House on Fernwood Road, which is the official residence of the Lord Mayor of Newcastle.  This house was built for Sir Arthur Sutherland, who was Lord Mayor himself in 1918-19; Sutherland had made a fortune in the shipping business, and the donation of the Mansion House was one of many philanthropic gifts which he made to the city.
</p><p>
In more recent years the proximity of Jesmond to the campuses of both Newcastle and Northumbria Universities on the northern edge of the city centre, together with its stock of large Victorian houses, has led to this becoming a student area.  The 2021 census found a population of 9,792 people living in South Jesmond ward, of whom 4,641 - almost half of the total - were full-time students.  South Jesmond ranked 25th of the wards in England and Wales for the 18-29 age group (60.8%), 35th for residents educated to A-level or equivalent but not yet further (41.5%), and 50th for households which were privately rented (54.5%); its proportion of people saying that they had no religion (55.5%) was the highest figure for any ward in the North East.
</p><p>
One thing which does not appear to be a consistent part of the modern-day student experience here in South Jesmond is going to the gov.uk website and filling out the form to register to vote.  And this has real-world consequences, as we can see from the history of South Jesmond ward.  This was created in 2004 from parts of two oversized wards called Jesmond and Sandyford, and on the 2001 electoral register it was more or less bang on the city-wide average with an electorate of 7,580.
</p><p>
But by the time the Local Government Boundary Commission for England next came to review Newcastle in 2015, South Jesmond's electorate had collapsed to 5,721.  This was not because of large-scale redevelopment or depopulation: it was because of Individual Electoral Registration, a change to electoral law which ended the practice of electoral registration forms being filled in by the head of the household on behalf of everyone living there.  The effect of this policy falls disproportionately on young and highly mobile people, particularly university students who would often previously have been registered <em>en bloc</em> by their university but who now had to do it all for themselves.  As we can see from the precipitous fall in electoral registration rates in student-heavy areas, a large percentage of them don't bother.
</p><p>
This has consequences when the Local Government Boundary Commission turn up, because they draw wards based not on population but on the number of <em>registered electors</em> who are projected to be living in each area in five years' time.  So Newcastle council prepared a forecast of what its electoral register would look like in 2021.  To quote from the LGBCE's draft report of June 2016:
</p><p>
<blockquote>
15. ... the Council submitted electorate forecasts for 2021, a period
five years on from the scheduled publication of our final recommendations in 2016.
These forecasts were broken down to polling district levels and projected an increase
in the electorate of approximately 18% to 2021. The forecasts considered two
elements to electorate growth: the building of new houses and student
accommodation, and the recovery of levels of electoral registration which had
decreased following the introduction of Individual Electoral Registration.
</p><p>
16. In the Council’s forecast, new housing and student accommodation would lead
to an increase in the total electorate of around 6.3%. When visiting the area, we
observed that a considerable amount of new housing development is currently taking
place throughout the city, particularly in the Great Park area. However, we noted that,
whilst a major proportion of the forecast increase would result from development in
the Kingston Park and Callerton areas, many of the sites for housing identified by the
Council are not in a state of readiness for construction. We asked the Council to
provide further information regarding the status of those sites and the likely rate of
development. Whilst the Council reaffirmed that the sites would be subject to
development, it was conceded that development would not commence at the rate
initially envisaged. The Council has therefore modified its expectation of the increase
in the electorate likely to come from new development to 5.8%.
</p><p>
17. A larger element of the forecast electoral increase is expected to be a recovery
of electoral registration which saw a sharp decrease following the introduction of
Individual Electoral Registration. The Council has identified trends in registration
which differ from area to area within the city, and between the student population and
the more settled population. Its forecasts reflect the council’s expectation of future
levels of registration. We note that between February 2015 and August 2015, the
number of electors registered in one polling district increased by 33% whilst in
several others, increases over the same period were around 20%. These increases
cannot be ascribed to new development, but to changes in electoral registration
levels amongst the already resident population. That such increases have been
achieved in a short period of time gives us confidence to accept as reasonable the
Council’s forecasts of electoral change through registration.
</p><p>
18. Having considered the information provided by the Council, we are satisfied that
the modified projected figures are the best available at the present time and these
figures form the basis of our draft recommendations.
</blockquote>
</p><p>
The final report in November 2016 proposed a slightly-modified South Jesmond ward with a 2015 electorate of 5,848, projected to rise to 8,407 by 2021.  The new ward boundaries were duly introduced in May 2018.  The actual electoral register for 2023 showed that enrolment here had fallen further to 5,027.
</p><p>
The December 2015 electoral register was the first to be affected by Individual Electoral Registration, so perhaps Newcastle's planners can be excused for not realising at the time that student registration in the city was simply not going to recover, and so the inner student-heavy wards like South Jesmond would remain well below the target electorate.  At the same time the city's outer wards covering Kingston Park and Callerton, where the LGBCE had queried the intended housebuilding rates, have ended up massively over the target electorate.
</p><p>
The overall effect was that Newcastle's 2018 boundary review was completely botched, and the LGBCE have had to come back to the city just a few years later and draw up another new ward map which will come into effect in May 2026.  So, unless another seat here falls vacant in the next three months this will be the last election to South Jesmond ward.  This time Newcastle's forecast electorate for 2029 accepts that student registration is not going to increase, and the 2026 ward map creates a single Jesmond ward as more or less a straight merger of the present North Jesmond and South Jesmond, with a cut from six councillors to three.  Those three seats will be transferred to Newcastle's fast-growing northwestern suburbs, while the three remaining councillors for Jesmond will have to deal with the problems of a massive student population which is, in effect, disenfranchised by the effects of Individual Electoral Registration.
</p><p>
In the meantime the UK Government published a policy paper last month titled <em><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/restoring-trust-in-our-democracy-our-strategy-for-modern-and-secure-elections/restoring-trust-in-our-democracy-our-strategy-for-modern-and-secure-elections">Restoring trust in our democracy</a></em>, indicating that they would bring forward a new elections and democracy bill.  Votes at 16 got the most headlines, but other proposals include "creating a system of automated registration" in order to improve the completeness of the electoral register by catching people - particularly young and highly mobile people - who could and should be registered to vote but aren't.  In many cases this is information which is already held by government departments such as the DWP, the DVLA and HMRC, or by university authorities, but which electoral registration officers struggle to get hold of.  Other countries already have similar methods of keeping their electoral rolls as complete as possible, and the Welsh government is currently trialling some approaches to see how automated electoral registration could work in a UK context.  Maybe this could be a solution to giving Jesmond the future council representation it deserves.
</p><p>
South Jesmond ward has been a safe Labour ward on Newcastle upon Tyne council since the Coalition government led to the Lib Dem vote here disappearing.  The Lib Dems have staged a bit of a recovery here in recent years but they are still a long way back, with the May 2024 Newcastle elections returning 42% for Labour, 26% for the Lib Dems and 21% for the Green Party.  Boundary changes for the 2024 general election transferred South Jesmond into the Newcastle North parliamentary seat, which is held by the school standards minister Catherine McKinnell.
</p><p>
The May 2024 election in South Jesmond was won by Labour's Milo Barnett, who has stepped down a year later due to work commitments.  That's not particularly good news for the Labour administration in Newcastle, which has recently fallen into a minority due to defection losses: the latest composition has 37 Labour councillors plus this vacancy against 22 Lib Dems, 15 independents, 2 Greens and one Conservative.  The city's Labour leader had fairly narrowly won a confidence vote back in December before the Labour group suffered further splits, and the Lib Dem opposition on the council are clearly itching for another chance to vote the party out.
</p><p>
Defending this by-election for Labour is Owen Bell, a Scout leader who has previously lived in the ward.  The Lib Dems' Jude Browne is described by the party as a long-time Jesmond resident and businesswoman.  The Greens have reselected Sarah Peters, a <s>junior</s> resident doctor who stood here in May and was also the Green candidate for Newcastle North at the general election.  Completing this ballot are Stephen Dawes for the Conservatives and Gavin Maw for Reform UK.

</p><p>
In the previous section we talked about the negative effects that Individual Electoral Registration have had on the electors of Jesmond, in Newcastle upon Tyne.  We'll now turn to another electoral reform from the last Conservative government which was discussed in last month's paper from the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/apply-for-photo-id-voter-authority-certificate">voter ID</a>.  You need this to vote in person at all elections in England: a list of acceptable photo ID is available at <a href="https://www.gov.uk/how-to-vote/photo-id-youll-need">gov.uk/how-to-vote/photo-id-youll-need</a>.
</p><p>
The 2024 general election was the first UK-wide poll where all electors in person had to show ID to be issued with a ballot paper, and this didn't go smoothly for everyone.  The new Labour government had this to say under the heading "Improving voter ID":
</p><p>
<blockquote>
37. This government was elected on a manifesto that promised to improve voter registration and address the inconsistencies in the voter ID rules that prevent legitimate voters from participating. There is no doubt that significant improvements are needed to futureproof the system and remove barriers to participation. These must be balanced to ensure legitimate electors are able to vote at the polling station, should they wish to, whilst also maintaining proportional safeguards against personation.
</p><p>
38. Evidence consistently shows that at least 2% of people in Great Britain do not hold a form of ID on the current list. Certain groups of people are less likely to have accepted forms of photo ID and so are disproportionately impacted by the policy. In addition, around 4% of non-voters at the 2024 General Election cited voter ID as a factor in their not turning out to vote.  The needs of future, younger voters and the increasing use of digital documentation must also be considered.
</blockquote>
</p><p>
The UK government has already acted to add the Armed Forces Veteran Card to the list of acceptable documents, a simple-sounding change which took well over 100 pages of secondary legislation to implement.  (Yes, really.  No, I am not making that up.)  New proposals include accepting UK-issued bank cards which show the elector's name as voter ID, on the grounds that nearly everyone will have such a card.  The government is also intending to issue ID documents in digital formats in the future - for example, a digital version of the UK driving licence is planned to launch later this year - and it is proposed that these digital IDs should also be accepted at polling stations.
</p><p>
These changes are welcome, but the UK government is unable to solve a further problem with voter ID: that it does not apply to all public UK elections.  The Scottish Parliament and Senedd Cymru, which are responsible for devolved and local elections in their areas, have not legislated for voter ID for those polls presumably on the grounds that they think the whole concept is a waste of time and money.  In Scotland, the July 2024 general election was the first time that electors had to grapple with Voter ID: in Wales, the policy's debut came at the May 2024 election for the country's four police and crime commissioners.
</p><p>
It appears that last year instructions had clearly been given to Welsh and Scottish returning officers not to combine polls where Voter ID was required with polls where it was not - which essentially meant that scheduling local by-elections involved that dangerous business of gambling on the general election date.  A number of early 2024 Welsh local by-elections were scheduled for Tuesdays apparently for this reason; and the 2024 Welsh police and crime commissioner elections were standalone affairs with no combined local by-elections.  No doubt we'll be going through this dance again in 2028 or 2029 when the next Westminster election is due.  This is regrettable for everyone involved: a large nationwide poll, when the electors would be turning out anyway, is normally an excellent opportunity to schedule council by-elections on the undercard and get two polls for the price of one.
</p><p>
So when Cardiff Labour councillor Abdul Sattar died in February 2024, it must have seemed natural to the local party to get the resulting by-election in Grangetown ward scheduled alongside the South Wales PCC election in May 2024.  But when the request for a by-election came in to the returning officer, the timing left him with no good options.  The local by-election (no Voter ID) could not be combined with the PCC election (Voter ID required), so the 2024 Grangetown by-election had to be scheduled for 25th April thus forcing the electors out in two consecutive weeks.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/cardiff-grangetown-2025.webp" alt="Caerdydd, Grangetown" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
As a result of this, Grangetown ward appeared in Andrew's Previews last year (<em>Andrew's Previews 2024</em>, forthcoming).  This is a heavily industrial area to the south-west of Cardiff city centre, between the River Taff to the east and the River Ely to the west as they both drain into Cardiff Bay.  Here can be found the Cardiff International Sports Village at the southern end of the ward, while much of the west of the ward is occupied by the large Leckwith Industrial Estate or the Canton railway depot.  The Grangetown area itself lies on the west back of the Taff, close to the city centre.
</p><p>
By Welsh standards this area has a very diverse population makeup.  Grangetown has the most mixed-race residents (5.7%) and the most Hindu residents (4.2%) of any ward in Wales, together with the country's second-highest black population (10.8%) and third-highest Muslim population (28.6%), and third-highest proportion of residents born in Africa (7.1%).
</p><p>
Which makes it appropriate that the local member of the Senedd was the first black politician to lead any European country: that's Zambian-born Vaughan Gething, who was briefly First Minister of Wales last year and has served since 2011 as MS for Cardiff South and Penarth.  The Westminster seat of the same name has been held since a 2012 by-election by Stephen Doughty, who is a junior Foreign Office minister with responsibility for Europe, North America and the UK's overseas territories.  For the 2026 Senedd election this Westminster seat will be combined with Cardiff West to form the six-seat Caerdydd Penarth constituency; on the votes cast for Westminster last July Caerdydd Penarth would have returned three Labour MSs and one each from Plaid Cymru, the Conservatives and Reform UK.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2022/cardiff22s.svgz" alt="Cardiff, 2022" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Recent ward boundary changes in Cardiff left Grangetown ward with unchanged boundaries, but increased its representation from three councillors to four to reflect recent population growth.  This was a Liberal Democrat ward while the party were running the city back in the noughties, but by the time this column visited in November 2016 (<em>Andrew's Previews 2016</em>, page 274) the Lib Dem vote had dwindled away and Grangetown was a Labour versus Plaid Cymru battle.  Plaid Cymru narrowly won that by-election, but subsequent local elections in 2017 and 2022 went to Labour.  In 2022 Grangetown became a safe Labour ward with the party's slate beating a joint Plaid Cymru and Green Party ticket by 53-28.  This makes it part of the Labour majority on Cardiff council: the 2022 elections returned 55 Labour councillors, 11 Conservatives, 10 Lib Dems, 2 Plaid and 1 councillor for the pro-independence party Propel.
</p><p>
As stated, Labour councillor and corner shop owner Abdul Sattar then passed away in February last year at the early age of 53.  The resulting by-election was safely held for Labour by his widow Waheeda Sattar, who polled 48% of the vote against widely split opposition: 19% for a joint Plaid Cymru-Green candidate and 13% for the Conservatives were best of the rest.
</p><p>
This time Cardiff Labour are looking to replace Sara Robinson, who has stood down from the council three years into her first term of office.  The defending Labour candidate is Khuram Chowdhry, who works in the recruitment sector and helps to run the Cardiff City basketball club in his spare time.  The Plaid Cymru/Green alliance in Cardiff has now been dissolved and the two parties are running their own candidates: Plaid Cymru have selected Neil Roberts, a finance professional who contested Fairwater ward in 2022, while the Wales Green Party candidate Matt Youde works for a befriending charity.  Standing for the Conservatives is James Hamblin, who was their Westminster candidate for Cardiff West last year; Hamblin previously worked in London as chief of staff for the disgraced ex-Conservative MP David Warburton, and he was a candidate for Hillingdon council in London in 2018.  Also on a long ballot paper are Vincent Yewlett for Propel, independent candidate Ahmed Abdi Samater who finished fifth here in last year's by-election, Irfan Latif for the Lib Dems and Joseph Martin for Reform UK.
