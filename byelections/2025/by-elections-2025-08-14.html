Two by-elections on 14th August 2025:
</p><p>
<h2>South Jesmond</h2>
</p><p>
Newcastle upon Tyne council, Tyne and Wear; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Milo Barnett.
</p><p>
Last week we had three polls which were all in the same kind of area - former coalfield communities in England and Wales - and they all had the same end result with wins for those new kids on the political block Reform UK.  This week's set is also rather homogeneous, with both seats up for election today being in strongly left-wing wards on the edges of major city centres.
</p><p>
Before we come to the English ward up for election today, let me point you to the official UK government portal for registering to vote: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/register-to-vote">www.gov.uk/register-to-vote</a>.  This is the landing page for a series of forms which promise to take about five minutes to fill out, and you will need to do this once when you are 16 (or 14, if you live in Scotland or Wales) and then every time you change your name, address or nationality.  Once you have filled this form in and your local council's electoral registration office have added you to the register, then you are on the list indefinitely: you don't have to go through all this every time there's an election in your area.
</p><p>
There's a lot of thought and hard work which has gone into this form, and not just for the backend which has to check all the details are fine and pass the information to your local electoral registration office.  The overall design is also worth a mention.  In 2013, which was gov.uk's first full year of operation, the site won the "Design of the Year" award from the Design Museum, with the jury praising its "well thought out, yet understated design".
</p><p>
One aspect of this design which has not changed since 2013 is that gov.uk uses only one typeface for all of its text.  All of the hundreds of government departments and agencies under the gov.uk umbrella use the font "New Transport", an update by designers Henrik Kubel and Margaret Calvert for the digital era of the "Transport" typeface which has been standard on all UK road signs since 1965.
</p><p>
The presence of Margaret Calvert as a co-developer of New Transport is extremely appropriate, because Calvert - who is now in her late 80s - was one of the designers of the original Transport all those years ago.  In the mid-1950s she was studying at the Chelsea College of Art when her tutor, Jock Kinneir, won a commission to design the signs for Gatwick Airport; he asked her to work on this project with him.  Out of this came work on new luggage labels for the P&O shipping line, whose chairman Colin Anderson was then asked by the government to chair the committee designing signs for Britain's first motorways which were about to open.  Anderson gave the job to Kinneir and Calvert, who designed the Transport font to a specific brief for a direction sign that could easily be read at motorway speeds.  The duo went on to comprehensively redesign the UK's signs for all-purpose roads, and most of their designs - including the Transport font - remain in use today with little modification.  (The young girl depicted in the "children crossing" sign is a self-portrait of Calvert.)  The Transport font itself has been exported all over the world, with several countries in Europe and Asia - including countries such as Greece, the UAE and India whose languages are not in the Latin script - using modified versions of Transport for their own road signs.
</p><p>
In 1971 Calvert was commissioned to create a new seriffed typeface for St Quentin-en-Yvelines, a New Town near Paris which was then under construction.  The French ended up rejecting the typeface for being "too English", but it was then taken up as the official font of the Tyne and Wear Metro, a scheme to revitalise the old Tyneside Electrics suburban railway network with new underground lines to serve central Newcastle and Gateshead.  In 2024 Nexus, the operating company for the Metro, invited Calvert to Newcastle for her to inspect what it had done with her work.

</p><p>
Jesmond station, which lies at the northern end of the central underground section, was one of the first Metro stations to open in 1980.  It's located just to the north of Newcastle city centre, not far outside the curious 1960s throwback of the Central Motorway East.  Originally part of the A1(M) and now numbered A167(M), this was the only part of an aggressive urban motorway network for Newcastle that ever got off the ground.  And I mean that literally: there is so little space here that the two carriageways are stacked one on top of the other, and the junctions with the A1058 Jesmond Road and the B1318 Great North Road - major arterial roads going east and north from the city centre - are both a tangle of tightly-curved viaducts.  Each September the motorway is closed to traffic and opened to half-marathon runners, as it lies within the first couple of miles of the Great North Run.
</p><p>
South Jesmond ward runs north-east from the Central Motorway East along the Jesmond Road, taking in the Sandyford area to the east of the city centre together with the southern end of Jesmond around Osborne Road.  This was traditionally a very affluent suburb of Newcastle, as can be seen from the presence here of a number of fee-paying schools (including the Royal Grammar School which traces its history to the 16th century) and the Mansion House on Fernwood Road, which is the official residence of the Lord Mayor of Newcastle.  This house was built for Sir Arthur Sutherland, who was Lord Mayor himself in 1918-19; Sutherland had made a fortune in the shipping business, and the donation of the Mansion House was one of many philanthropic gifts which he made to the city.
</p><p>
In more recent years the proximity of Jesmond to the campuses of both Newcastle and Northumbria Universities on the northern edge of the city centre, together with its stock of large Victorian houses, has led to this becoming a student area.  The 2021 census found a population of 9,792 people living in South Jesmond ward, of whom 4,641 - almost half of the total - were full-time students.  South Jesmond ranked 25th of the wards in England and Wales for the 18-29 age group (60.8%), 35th for residents educated to A-level or equivalent but not yet further (41.5%), and 50th for households which were privately rented (54.5%); its proportion of people saying that they had no religion (55.5%) was the highest figure for any ward in the North East.
</p><p>
One thing which does not appear to be a consistent part of the modern-day student experience here in South Jesmond is going to the gov.uk website and filling out the form to register to vote.  And this has real-world consequences, as we can see from the history of South Jesmond ward.  This was created in 2004 from parts of two oversized wards called Jesmond and Sandyford, and on the 2001 electoral register it was more or less bang on the city-wide average with an electorate of 7,580.
</p><p>
But by the time the Local Government Boundary Commission next came to review Newcastle in 2015, South Jesmond's electorate had collapsed to 5,721.  This was not because of large-scale redevelopment or depopulation: it was because of Individual Electoral Registration, a change to electoral law which ended the practice of electoral registration forms being filled in by the head of the household on behalf of everyone living there.  The effect of this policy falls disproportionately on young and highly mobile people, particularly university students who would often previously have been registered <em>en bloc</em> by their university but who now had to do it all for themselves.  As we can see from the precipitous fall in electoral registration rates in student-heavy areas, a large percentage of them don't bother.
</p><p>
This has consequences when the Local Governemnt Boundary Commission turn up, because they draw wards based not on population but on the number of <em>registered electors</em> who are projected to be living in each area in five years' time.  So Newcastle council prepared a forecast of what its electoral register would look like in 2021.  To quote from the LGBCE's draft report of June 2016:
</p><p>
<blockquote>
15. ... the Council submitted electorate forecasts for 2021, a period
five years on from the scheduled publication of our final recommendations in 2016.
These forecasts were broken down to polling district levels and projected an increase
in the electorate of approximately 18% to 2021. The forecasts considered two
elements to electorate growth: the building of new houses and student
accommodation, and the recovery of levels of electoral registration which had
decreased following the introduction of Individual Electoral Registration.
</p><p>
16. In the Councilâ€™s forecast, new housing and student accommodation would lead
to an increase in the total electorate of around 6.3%. When visiting the area, we
observed that a considerable amount of new housing development is currently taking
place throughout the city, particularly in the Great Park area. However, we noted that,
whilst a major proportion of the forecast increase would result from development in
the Kingston Park and Callerton areas, many of the sites for housing identified by the
Council are not in a state of readiness for construction. We asked the Council to
provide further information regarding the status of those sites and the likely rate of
development. Whilst the Council reaffirmed that the sites would be subject to
development, it was conceded that development would not commence at the rate
initially envisaged. The Council has therefore modified its expectation of the increase
in the electorate likely to come from new development to 5.8%.
</p><p>
17. A larger element of the forecast electoral increase is expected to be a recovery
of electoral registration which saw a sharp decrease following the introduction of
Individual Electoral Registration. The Council has identified trends in registration
which differ from area to area within the city, and between the student population and
the more settled population. Its forecasts reflect the councilâ€™s expectation of future
levels of registration. We note that between February 2015 and August 2015, the
number of electors registered in one polling district increased by 33% whilst in
several others, increases over the same period were around 20%. These increases
cannot be ascribed to new development, but to changes in electoral registration
levels amongst the already resident population. That such increases have been
achieved in a short period of time gives us confidence to accept as reasonable the
Councilâ€™s forecasts of electoral change through registration.
</p><p>
18. Having considered the information provided by the Council, we are satisfied that
the modified projected figures are the best available at the present time and these
figures form the basis of our draft recommendations.
</blockquote>
</p><p>
The final report in November 2016 proposed a slightly-modified South Jesmond ward with a 2015 electorate of 5,848, projected to rise to 8,407 by 2021.  The new ward boundaries were duly introduced in May 2018.  The actual electoral register for 2023 showed that enrolment here had fallen further to 5,027.
</p><p>
The December 2015 electoral register was the first to be affected by Individual Electoral Registration, so perhaps Newcastle's planners can be excused for not realising at the time that student registration in the city was simply not going to recover, and so the inner student-heavy wards like South Jesmond would remain well below the target electorate.  At the same time the city's outer wards covering Kingston Park and Callerton, where the LGBCE had queried the intended housebuilding rates, have ended up massively over the target electorate.
</p><p>
The overall effect was that Newcastle's 2018 boundary review was completely botched, and the LGBCE have had to come back to the city just a few years later and draw up another new ward map which will come into effect in May 2026.  So, unless another seat here falls vacant in the next three months this will be the last election to South Jesmond ward.  This time Newcastle's forecast electorate for 2029 accepts that student registration is not going to increase, and the 2026 ward map creates a single Jesmond ward as more or less a straight merger of the present North Jesmond and South Jesmond, with a cut from six councillors to three.  Those three seats will be transferred to Newcastle's fast-growing northwestern suburbs, while the three remaining councillors for Jesmond will have to deal with the problsms of a massive student population which is, in effect, disenfranchisd by the effects of Individual Electoral Registration.
</p><p>
In the meantime the UK Government published a policy paper last month titled <em><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/restoring-trust-in-our-democracy-our-strategy-for-modern-and-secure-elections/restoring-trust-in-our-democracy-our-strategy-for-modern-and-secure-elections">Restoring trust in our democracy</a></em>, indicating that they would bring forward a new elections and democracy bill.  Votes at 16 got the most headlines, but other proposals include "creating a system of automated registration" in order to improve the completeness of the electoral register by catching people - particularly young and highly mobile people - who could and should be registered to vote but aren't.  In many cases this is information which is already held by government departments such as the DWP, the DVLA and HMRC, or by university authorities, but which electoral registration officers struggle to get hold of.  Other countries already have similar methods of keeping their electoral rolls as complete as possible, and the Welsh government is currently trialling some approaches to see how automated electoral registration could work in a UK context.  Maybe this could be a solution to giving Jesmond the future council representation it deserves.
</p><p>
South Jesmond ward has been a safe Labour ward on Newcastle upon Tyne council since the Coalition government led to the Lib Dem vote here disappearing.  The Lib Dems have staged a bit of a recovery here in recent years but they are still a long way back, with the May 2024 Newcastle elections returning 42% for Labour, 26% for the Lib Dems and 21% for the Green Party.  Boundary changes for the 2024 general election transferred South Jesmond into the Newcastle North parliamentary seat, which is held by the school standards minister Catherine McKinnell.
</p><p>
The May 2024 election in South Jesmond was won by Labour's Milo Barnett, who has stepped down a year later due to work commitments.  That's not particularly good news for the Labour administration in Newcastle, which has recently fallen into a minority due to defection losses: the latest composition has 37 Labour councillors plus this vacancy against 22 Lib Dems, 15 independents, 2 Greens and one Conservative.  The city's Labour leader had fairly narrowly won a confidence vote back in December before the Labour group suffered further splits, and the Lib Dem opposition on the council are clearly itching for another chance to vote the party out.
</p><p>
Defending this by-election for Labour is Owen Bell, a Scout leader who has previously lived in the ward.  The Lib Dems' Jude Browne is described by the party as a long-time Jesmond resident and businesswoman.  The Greens have reselected Sarah Peters, a <s>junior</s> resident doctor who stood here in May and was also the Green candidate for Newcastle North at the general election.  Completing this ballot are Stephen Dawes for the Conservatives and Gavin Maw for Reform UK.
