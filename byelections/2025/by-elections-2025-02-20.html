Before we start, apologies are due to subscribers for a number of howlers in the Alperton piece on Tuesday.  Alperton ward was part of Brent South, not Brent East, before 2010; the link to previous results was wrong; and the date of the poll was given wrongly in two different places in two different ways.  Must try harder.  These errors have been fixed on the Substack website.

Five by-elections on 20th February 2025:
</p><p>
<h2>Hammersmith Broadway; and<br>
Lillie</h2>
</p><p>
Hammersmith and Fulham council, London; caused respectively by the resignations of Labour councillors Emma Apthorp and Ben Coleman.
</p><p>
<blockquote>
...a mood that had haunted him for nearly forty years: during his solitary walks in Hammersmith he had always been aware of the aloofness of the quiet river, unhurried and unconcerned, while just round the corner there was all the noise and hustle and exuberant vulgarity of the cockney crowd, pushing and shoving and sweating and swearing and shrieking and guffawing its good-humoured way...

</p><p>
This was the mood in which Gustav Holst wrote one of his late works, the 1930 prelude and scherzo <em>Hammersmith</em>.  Commissioned by the BBC Military Band and definitely the most challenging of his works for wind ensemble, <em>Hammersmith</em> presents a series of contrasts.  Its slow opening section - with the tune and the bass line in completely different keys but somehow working well together - is said to represent the river Thames flowing under Hammersmith Bridge, while the hustle and bustle of the town next to it are well-represented.
</p><p>
The theme of contrasts continues when we see that <em>Hammersmith</em> is dedicated "to the author of <em>The Water Gypsies</em>", a novel of the same year whose protagonist, Jane Bell, was a working-class girl from Hammersmith who has relationships with an illiterate bargeman and a wealthy artist.  That author and dedicatee was the humourist A P Herbert, who went on to serve from 1935 to 1950 as an independent MP for Oxford University .  Like Holst, Herbert lived in Hammersmith for many years.
</p><p>
The river here is not always as peaceful as Holst made out.  Every spring tens of thousands of people are brought to Hammersmith to spectate on the Boat Race, an annual competition between the rowing clubs of Oxford and Cambridge Universities.  For some reason, it's always those two in the final.  The Boat Race is held on the River Thames from Putney to Mortlake, with Hammersmith Bridge lying just before the halfway point.  The Head of the River Race, which uses a time-trial format, is rowed over the same course but in the opposite direction.
</p><p>

</p><p>
Both of these events were cancelled in 2020 due to the pandemic, while in 2021 the Boat Race was moved to Cambridgeshire - not just because of the pandemic, but also because of the very poor structural condition of Hammersmith Bridge.  This was built in the 1880s to a design of Sir Joseph Bazalgette, who had previously been responsible for the construction of London's sewerage system.  Unlike his sewers, the bridge design has not stood up to the twin tests of time and modern traffic, and repairs to it have been the subject of frequent wrangling between central government and Hammersmith and Fulham council over the cost.  Building a more modern structure which would be easier to maintain is apparently out of the question.  Hammersmith Bridge is currently open only to pedestrians and cyclists, and any reopening to road traffic would involve turning it into a toll bridge.

</p><p>
The council itself is located in Hammersmith Town Hall, a building in the 1930s Municipal style located at the western end of Hammersmith Broadway ward.  This ward is the town centre, containing such landmarks as the Apollo/Odeon theatre, the bus station and the District/Piccadilly Line underground station, and the Hammersmith Flyover which carries the A4 arterial road above all of this.  Also here are the Riverside Studios, an arts centre on the riverbank where iconic TV programmes such as <em>Doctor Who</em>, <em>Blue Peter</em> and <em>TFI Friday</em> were made.  The studio building was rebuilt in the 2010s, and one of the first TV broadcasts from here after its reopening was Channel 4's 2019 general election night programme.
</p><p>
The original Hammersmith Bridge was authorised by an Act of 1824, in the same year that Parliament also passed the Kensington Canal Act.  Opened in 1828, this canal ran north-west from the Thames to a basin on Warwick Road in Kensington, and it became the boundary between the modern boroughs of Hammersmith and Fulham, and Kensington and Chelsea.  The canal passed under the Lillie Bridge, which took its name from the local Anglo-Irish landowner Sir John Lillie: he lived nearby at a house called The Hermitage, and he was a major investor in both the old Hammersmith Bridge and the Kensington Canal.  Lillie had had a distinguished military career in the British and Portuguese armies, being wounded three times in the Peninsular War, and he also had a talent for invention and stood for Parliament as a Whig candidate.  Unfortunately his investment in the Kensington Canal proved to be a failure, and the canal was eventually converted into the West London Railway: it's now part of the Mildmay line of the London Overground, and the Lillie Bridge now overlooks West Brompton station.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/hammersmith-fulham-lillie-2025.png" alt="Hammersmith/Fulham, Lillie" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Lillie Bridge is the northern corner of Fulham's Lillie ward, whose northern boundary is the Lillie Road.  This area was heavily bombed during the Second World War and much of it was subsequently redeveloped by Fulham council: the result of this was the Clem Attlee Court estate, a series of high- and low-rise council houses from the 1950s and 1960s.  Also here are the Peabody Fulham Estate and some rather higher-status housing to the south, around Walham Grove and the London Oratory School.
</p><p>
The present Lillie ward was created in 2022 as a cut-down version of the former Fulham Broadway ward, which was covered by this column at a previous by-election in September 2019 (<em>Andrew's Previews 2019</em>, page 288).  Even with the Attlee estate in it this ward has a rather professional demographic, and in the 2021 census Lillie made the top 100 wards in England and Wales for residents born in the EU-14 states (14.2%), the White Other ethnic group (26.1%) and flats or apartments (86.1% of households).  Fulham Broadway ward had a marginal political history and it voted Conservative as recently as 2010, but Labour had a big lead in Lillee ward in 2022 - 63-26 over the Conservatives.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2022/hammersmith-fulham22s.svgz" alt="Hammersmith/Fulham, 2022" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Hammersmith Broadway ward, which has a similar demographic profile to Lillie ward, was also seriously cut down by the 2022 ward boundary changes: it lost an area to the north of the town centre which became part of the new Grove ward.  It has voted Labour at every council election this century: Labour's lead here in 2022 was 72-19 over the Conservatives, but previous elections have been much closer.  There is a famous political name among its former councillors: Lisa Nandy, the culture secretary, was a councillor for Hammersmith Broadway ward from 2006 until she was elected as MP for Wigan in 2010.  The present MP for this ward is former Hammersmith and Fulham council leader Andy Slaughter, who was first elected in 2005 to what was then the Ealing Acton and Shepherd's Bush constituency; several boundary changes later, his seat is now called Hammersmith and Chiswick.  Slaughter is the current chair of the Commons Justice select committee.
</p><p>
The latest Hammersmith and Fulham councillor to make the step up to the green benches is former Lillie ward councillor Ben Coleman, who was first elected for the former Fulham Broadway ward in 2014.  He had been deputy leader of the council until he rode the 2024 Labour landslide and benefitted from favourable boundary changes to become the first Labour MP for Chelsea and Fulham, the constituency which covers Lillie ward.  Coleman defeated the Conservative MP Greg Hands, a long-standing trade minister, by just 152 votes.  He has now stood down from the council to concentrate on his duties in Westminster.
</p><p>
The Hammersmith Broadway by-election is to replace Labour councillor Emma Apthorp, who was elected for the first time in 2022 when she was just 22, having graduated in philosophy from Cambridge University the previous year.  She immediately found herself thrust into the Civic Chair, serving in 2022-23 as the youngest-ever mayor of Hammersmith and Fulham.  Apthorp resigned from the council last month to take up a new job working for the United Nations in New York.
</p><p>
Defending the Hammersmith Broadway by-election for Labour is Callum Nimmo, who works as a PR consultant.  The Conservatives have selected Nora Farah, who contested White City ward in the 2022 council election.  Also standing are Meerav Shah for the Lib Dems, Anthony Goodwin for Reform UK and Colin Murphy for the Green Party.
</p><p>
In Lillie ward the Labour defence is led by Lydia Paynter, who works for a charity which is seeking to eradicate malaria; she contested the neighbouring Munster ward in 2022.  The Conservative candidate is Matt Sinclair.  Here we have a four-candidate ballot paper, with Conor Campbell for the Lib Dems and Peter Hunter for Reform UK also standing.

<h2>Whalebone</h2>
</p><p>
Barking and Dagenham council, London; caused by the death of Labour councillor Glenda Paddle.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/whalebone-house.jpg" alt="Whalebone House" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Our final London poll of the week is in the east of the capital, but we still have a link with the Thames.  At some point in the seventeenth century there was a storm which left a whale stranded on the Thames shoreline in Dagenham, and this whale's jawbones ended up being erected either side of the gate leading to a Tudor or Jacobean house on the High Road in Chadwell Heath.  This became known as Whalebone House, and it gave its name to two thoroughfares either side of the High Road called Whalebone Lane North and Whalebone Lane South.  Whalebone House was destroyed in the Blitz, but the road names stuck.  The bones themselves apparently still exist in the collection of the local Valence House museum, but they are no longer on display due to being in poor condition.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/barking-dagenham-whalebone-2025.png" alt="Barking/Dagenham, Whalebone" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
This is one of the wards covering Chadwell Heath, an area which is split between the Redbridge borough and the Barking and Dagenham borough.  Chadwell Heath grew up around the High Road, which started life as the Roman road from Londinium to Colchester: one indication of this road's antiquity is the Havering Stone, which lies on the verge of the High Road and still marks the boundary with Havering borough today.  The High Road is the northern boundary of Whalebone ward, while its southern boundary is Green Lane which meets Whalebone Lane South at Becontree Heath.  In between is a large industrial area and the Great Eastern Main Line: the Elizabeth Line station at Chadwell Heath is just off the ward's western boundary.  For many years West Ham United's training ground was located in this ward next to the railway line: the first team moved out a few years ago, but the club academy is still based here.
</p><p>
Whalebone ward was created in 2002 and took on its current boundaries in 2022.  At its first election the ward's three seats were split one to Labour and two to the Chadwell Heath Residents Association, which ceased to contest elections shortly afterwards.  Both Residents councillors stood down in 2006 and their seats went to Labour who have held the ward ever since, often with large majorities.  Barking and Dagenham has had a full slate of Labour councillors since 2010, and in 2022 the Labour slate in Whalebone ward was opposed only by a single Conservative candidate who lost by the heavy margin of 71-29.  This is a multicultural area these days, with the 2021 census placing Whalebone within the top 100 wards in England and Wales for residents born in Romania or Bulgaria (6.9%) and for residents aged under 16 (27.1%).
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2022/barking-dagenham22s.svgz" alt="Barking/Dagenham, 2022" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
This ward is part of the Dagenham and Rainham constituency, where former Barking and Dagenham councillor Margaret Mullane is in her first term as a Labour MP.  She stood down from the council last year resulting in a November 2024 by-election in Dagenham's Village ward, which Labour held easily.  In other circumstances we might have had a by-election in Whalebone ward at the same time, because Labour ward councillor Andrew Achilleos was their parliamentary candidate for the neighbouring Romford seat last year; however, he narrowly failed to dislodge Conservative MP Andrew Rosindell.
</p><p>
As it happens, by the time the Village by-election was held this poll was already in the pipeline following the death of Whalebone ward councillor Glenda Paddle in November 2024.  Paddle had served as a councillor since 2018, and in 2014 she had been awarded the freedom of the borough for her 32 years of service as a school governor.  In the 2018 and 2022 elections Paddle had topped the poll despite being lower down the alphabetical ballot paper than Achilleos, which is often a sign of a personal vote.
</p><p>
Defending this seat for Labour is Rubina Siddiqui, who is the manager of the Chadwell Heath Community Centre.  The Conservatives have selected Angelica Olawepo, who comes here hotfoot from a by-election in Barking's Northbury ward last November: Olawepo was once the "young mayor" of Barking and Dagenham: she now works in the law, she contested Heath ward for the Conservatives in 2022, and she was also a semi-finalist in the 2024 edition of Miss England.  Herbert Munangatire for the Lib Dems and Tope Olawoyin for the Greens complete an all-BAME ballot paper.

<h2>Tiptree</h2>
</p><p>
Colchester council, Essex; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Roger Mannion.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/colchester-tiptree-2025.png" alt="Colchester, Tiptree" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Our rural by-election this week comes in Essex.  Although describing Tiptree as rural is a bit of a stretch: the village has a population of over 9,000 and is one of the many, many claimants for the title of England's largest village.  It lies roughly midway between Colchester and Maldon, about ten miles south-west of England's oldest and newest city.
</p><p>
For over a century Tiptree's economy has been driven by the Wilkin and Sons jam factory, which was founded by local farmers in 1885 and turns Essex fruit into jam, marmalade and other preserves under the Tiptree brand.  Wilkin's haven't sold out to the major food conglomerates: the founding family are still involved in the company, which owns significant property in Tiptree for staff accommodation, and its employees own almost half of the company through a trust.  All rather reminiscent of the Victorian model villages of old.
</p><p>
Politically Tiptree is another true-blue Essex village.  It's a safe Conservative ward of the permanently-hung Colchester council, which has returned Tory councillors continuously since 2003 and voted for independent candidates before then.  There is a radical right vote here, with UKIP coming close to winning in 2014.  Votes here in 2024 were an unusually-low 45% for re-elected Conservative councillor Roger Mannion, 24% for Labour and 19% for Reform UK, one of RUK's better scores in the May 2024 local elections.  Colchester council is permanently hung, and the Conservatives are currently the largest party with 18 out of 51 seats plus this vacancy: this is not enough for them to govern, and the Lib Dem group of 14 councillors is currently running a minority administration with support from the equally-sized Labour group.
</p><p>
In elections to Essex county council - which will not be going ahead in May - Tiptree is part of a bizarrely-drawn county division called Mersea and Tiptree, which is not contiguous on land and doesn't even contain the whole of Mersea Island.  This was very safely Conservative when it was last contested in 2021.  The village is part of the Witham constituency, which safely re-elected the former Home Secretary Priti Patel last year while other Tory MPs were falling like ninepins.
</p><p>
This by-election follows the death of Roger Mannion, who passed away in November as the result of a brain tumour.  Mannion had served the ward on Colchester council since 2021 and also spent three years as chair of Tiptree parish council.  He had served in the Falklands War as a Royal Navy helicopter pilot, and his career after leaving the Forces was a varied one which including running his own business, tutoring and lecturing, working on lighting and technical effects in theatres, and writing four books on steam and model railways.
</p><p>
In defending this by-election the Conservatives have turned to the next generation by selecting 22-year-old Will Calverley.  The Labour candidate is John Spademan, who is a parish councillor in Stanway and contested the neighbouring Marks Tey and Layer ward last year.  Standing for Reform UK is Patricia Harrison, who is a Pilates instructor.  Completing this ballot paper are Jenny Stevens for the Lib Dems and Patrick Merienne for the Greens.

<h2>Kilmarnock North</h2>
</p><p>
East Ayrshire council, Scotland; caused by the death of Labour councillor Maureen McKay.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/e-ayrs-kilmarnock-n-2025.png" alt="E Ayrs, Kilmarnock N" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
We finish for this week in Scotland by returning to a ward which this column last visited in March 2014.  Kilmarnock North ward does pretty much what it says on the tin: this is a residential area covering much of northern Kilmarnock, specifically the Altonhill, Longpark, Onthank, Knockinlaw and Southcraigs housing estates.  These are often deprived areas, and the 2010 BBC Scotland documentary <em>The Scheme</em> - which covered the lives of six families living in Knockinlaw and Onthank - was criticised as "poverty porn".  Multiple court cases involving the participants in the documentary meant that it was not broadcast in full until 2011.
</p><p>
Kilmarnock is the home of East Ayrshire council, where the Scottish National Party are the largest group and run the council as a minority.  The 2022 elections returned 14 SNP coucnillors, 10 Labour, 4 Conservatives, 3 independents and one councillor from the Rubbish Party.  (What do you think of it so far?)  Like most of Scotland's Westminster seats, the Kilmarnock and Loudoun seat was gained by Labour from the SNP in 2024; the new Labour MP Lillian Jones subsequently resigned her seat on East Ayrshire council, and Labour held the resulting by-election in Kilmarnock West and Crosshouse ward.  The local MSP since 2007 has been the SNP's Willie Coffey, who topped the poll at the first election to the modern Kilmarnock North ward in 2007 and was first elected for predecessor wards all the way back in 1992.  His sister Helen Coffey was an SNP ward councillor here until she retired in 2022.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2022/e-ayrshire22s.svgz" alt="E Ayrs, 2022" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
In its four elections to date Kilmarnock North has normally returned two SNP councillors and Labour councillor Maureen McKay, with the exception of the 2017 election when the SNP lost their second seat to the Conservatives.  First preferences here in 2022 were 48% for the SNP, 28% for Labour and 14% for the Conservatives, who were not helped by their former councillor Ian Grant seeking re-election as an independent candidate: Grant polled 8.1% and was eliminated in fifth place.  A single-seat count here would have returned the SNP's Elaine Cowan with a decent margin of 55-45 over Labour's Maureen McKay.
</p><p>
So this will be a difficult by-election for Labour to defend following Maureen McKay's death in November after a long illness.  McKay was the leader of the opposition Labour group on the council, and she had been first elected in 2003 for the single-member Dunlop and Stewarton East ward before transferring here in 2007.
</p><p>
That task of defence falls to Labour candidate Greg Mackenzie.  The SNP have selected Caroline Barton, who according to her social media is a Parliament staffer and "owner of [a] crazy springer spaniel".  The Conservatives have reselected Allan Macdonald, who was the runner-up here in 2022.  Also on the ballot are former Conservative councillor Ian Grant again standing as an independent, Finlay Affleck for the Greens, Sandra Kirkwood for Reform UK, Lee Manley for the Lib Dems and Stephen McNamara who has previously been associated with the Libertarian Party but is now (as he was in the Kilmarnock West and Crosshouse by-election last year) an independent candidate.  The usual Scottish comments apply here: Votes at 16 and the Alternative Vote are in use, please rank the candidates on your ballot paper in order of preference.
