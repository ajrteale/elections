<!-- Andrew's previews continue to be historical and electoral tours de force. - Lord Hayward -->

</p><p>
<h2>Andrew's Previews - the last 15 years, and the future</h2>
</p><p>
Before we start this week, a quick note is in order: this week is the fifteenth anniversary of this column.  Yes, Andrew's Previews really has been going for that long.  So, to mark the occasion I wanted to give regular readers a look back at the history of this column - and why I started doing all this in the first place.
</p><p>
The name "Andrew's Previews" comes from a chance remark by none other than Robert Waller, who is one of the masters of the art of writing electoral penpics.  His <em>Almanac of British Politics</em> was an enormous and magisterial tome which went through eight editions from the 1980s up to 2007.  No further editions of the <em>Almanac</em> have been forthcoming since then, but Waller remains active on the psephological scene.
</p><p>
Another inspiration was <a href="https://lewisbaston.substack.com">Lewis Baston</a>, who with his co-author Simon Henig (who later served as leader of Durham council) wrote a book in advance of the 2005 general election: <em>Politico's Guide to the General Election 2005</em>.  Much of this book was taken up with in-depth profiles of the marginal seats at that election.  I read every word.  I learned much.
</p><p>
What Baston's and Waller's books had in common was a focus on the parliamentary constituency as a unit, and any speculation was understandably focused on the next general election.  Where local elections were mentioned - and they often were - it was as a means to an end, not as an end in itself.
</p><p>
This is a shame, for local elections are much more common.  They happen every May without fail somewhere in the UK, whereas general elections might only come around twice in a decade.  Parliamentary by-elections have become rarer in recent years as the trend is for MPs to become younger and healthier; in an average year we will now see only a handful of such polls.  But local by-elections, to fill vacancies among the UK's 25,000 or so principal local councillors from 10,000 or so wards (the numbers change from year to year at the whim of the Local Government Boundary Commissions) happen on a much more frequent basis; on average, around five polls will be taking place every week.
</p><p>
In 2002, to mark the first local elections in which I was eligible to vote, I started what became the <a href="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/leap/">Local Elections Archive Project</a> as a freely-accessible online archive of Great Britain's local election results.  It may surprise readers to learn that there is no central, official register of local elections, and it is up to the UK's 400-odd local councils to publish their results in whatever manner they see fit.  These days every council puts them on their website, but back in 2002 this was not always the case - indeed back in 2002 not every council even had a website - which made research into the subject of local elections rather difficult.  Even now the local election result collector is faced with nearly 400 different council websites using nearly 400 different formats.  Merely keeping track of it all is a nightmare.
</p><p>
The situation with local by-elections is rather better, perhaps because there are fewer of them.  The Association of Liberal Democrat Councillors has been publishing their results for over thirty years now, and the various political parties have a good, if not completely infallible, crowdsourcing effort to identify future vacancies.
</p><p>
The amateur psephological community has been blessed with some active web forums over the years, one of which has for a long time been running a monthly prediction competition for future local by-elections.  I wanted to try and win it, and I also wanted to show off my knowledge - such as it was - and inform other forum users about the contests and their nature.  So on 7th September 2010 I put fingers to keyboard and wrote the following on the International Elections board of what was then called the <em>US Election Atlas</em> forum:
</p><p>
<blockquote><em>
A quick heads-up on Thursday's local by-elections, apart from those in Exeter and Norwich (see separate thread).
</p><p>
ASPATRIA AND WHARRELS, Cumbria county council; caused by the death of the Leader of the Council.  Very Tory countryside running from the small Cumberland town of Aspatria (between Carlisle and Workington) into the national park as far as the northern edge of Keswick; this division includes Skiddaw, the fourth-highest mountain in England.  In 2009 the division voted C 56.8% Lab 24.8% LD 18.4%; unusually the by-election is a straight fight between Conservative and Green Party candidates.
</p><p>
AYRESOME, Middlesbrough; caused by the resignation of a Labour councillor (who had, however, been elected as an Independent).  <a href="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/0rg3#ward1638">2007 result here</a>.  The name "Ayresome" conjures up images of Middlesbrough FC's old ground at Ayresome Park; put those away, Ayresome Park was in Linthorpe ward.  This is a fairly typical working-class Middlesbrough ward on the western edge of the town, hard up against the A19 and A66 dual carriageways.
</p><p>
KILNHOUSE, Fylde, Lancs; caused by the death of a Tory councillor.  Kilnhouse ward is on the northern edge of St Annes, just off the Blackpool Airport runway.  <a href="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/0rkh#ward3425">2007 result here</a>.  Lytham St Annes tends to be a fight between the Tories and Fylde Ratepayers, but the Ratepayers aren't standing in the by-election.
</p><p>
LIBERTON/GILMERTON, Edinburgh; caused by one of the Labour councillors winning Edinburgh South at the general election.  This is a ward covering peripheral estates on the south-eastern edge of Edinburgh.  First preferences in 2007 were Lab 4628 (they ran two candidates) SNP 3471 C 1912 LD 1902 Grn 464 Scottish Socialist Party 208 Solidarity 132 Inds 207 and 123, with Labour winning two seats, the SNP one and the Lib Dem candidate getting enough SNP surplus transfers to overtake the Tory candidate for the other seat.  The by-election sees the Pirate Party's first ever local government candidate.
</p><p>
NEWTOWN, Poole; caused by one of the Lib Dem councillors deciding he would rather run a "Buy British" campaign.  <a href="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/0rg4#ward2448">2007 result here</a>.  Poole is not a town I know at all, but the politics suggest a safe Lib Dem ward.
</em></blockquote>
</p><p>
That was the first edition of Andrewâ€™s Previews.  I'd like to think that my writing style has improved over the last fifteen years as this column found its voice, but you can judge that for yourself.
</p><p>
Two things developed from this beginning.  First, it became clear that doing well in the prediction competition was going to take a lot more research than that.  Second, it became clear that I enjoyed writing this sort of thing, and I started taking time out every week to do the research required.  Eventually the second reason became more important than the first, and I started writing the Previews for their own sake rather than as a means to an end.
</p><p>
One compelling personal reason for doing the research was that it linked in nicely with another hobby of mine - quiz.  To do well in quiz you have to be able to make and recognise connections between all sorts of apparently disparate things.  It's rather like the business of writing this column, which enables me to indulge in research on some of my favourite quiz subjects.  In writing these previews I normally take care to include extra facts about a particular ward, partly because it adds colour, light and shade to the profile and partly because it might come up in a quiz.
</p><p>
It seems to work.  On a number of occasions I have won the "Civilisation" section of the annual British Quiz Championships - with a syllabus of "human geography, cultures, technology, current affairs etc", so the bread-and-butter issues of this column - against a field of many of the greatest quizzers in the country, several of whose names you might recognise from television.  The quiz experience also feeds back into the Previews, because playing quiz enables me to travel the country and write pieces drawing from personal experience.
</p><p>
In July 2017 I was inspired to collect the previous year's Previews into a book.  This turned into a series of (currently) eight annual <em>Andrew's Previews</em> books, covering the years from 2016 to 2023.  Self-publishing them has been great fun.  The 2024 book is nearly ready and I'm just waiting for my technical proofreader to get back to me with his corrections.
</p><p>
This column moved to Substack eleven months ago after many years on Medium, and I'm very happy with how that move has turned out.  Editing pieces on Substack is a much more modern and generally nicer experience than it was on Medium, and seeing the readership grow and grow is gratifying to see.
</p><p>
That move to Substack is just the latest change in Andrew's Previews' complicated publication history.  Historically this column has mainly been written for other people's blogs.  I am grateful to my past and present genial hosts Kristofer Keane, Ian Warren and of course Ben Walker of Britain Elects, who has done so much in his own way to promote, explain and disseminate the UK's elections over the last decade and more.
</p><p>
There's one major difference between Walker's journalism and mine, which is that he gets paid for writing what he does - and long may Ben continue to draw a wage for doing that.  Andrew's Previews, on the other hand, was entirely a labour of love until a rather well-known political journalist persuaded me to put a donation link onto the Local Elections Archive Project.  That link can be found at the bottom of every weekly Preview.  The monies from it have enabled this column to grow, and have funded and continue to fund research trips to inform the occasional Parliamentary Special editions.  A future visit to the forthcoming Senedd by-election in Caerphilly is on my list of things to do in the near future, assuming I can find space in the diary for it.
</p><p>
From later this month, there will be a new way to support the Previews as, thanks to the magic of Substack, I am introducing a paid tier of membership.  This is being set at Â£5 per month or Â£50 per year, and it will come with three benefits over free membership of the Previews.  First, you will get your weekly fix on Wednesday evenings rather than once the polls open on Thursday morning.  Second, you will be able to claim a complimentary copy of the annual Previews books.  Finally, you will have full access to the Previews archive.  In the event that you think Â£50 per year is not enough for the quality of this work, there will also be a Founding level of membership which will buy you all of that, with the extra feature that your complimentary copy of the annual Previews books will be signed.
</p><p>
If you're not able to afford to pay this, don't fret.  Andrew's Previews is free to read.  It will always remain free to read, and if you stay on the free membership tier then nothing will change for you except that Previews which are more than a year old may end up behind a paywall.  If there is anybody who has pledged a paid membership in the past but who has now read this and had second thoughts, then you have two weeks to change your mind before I push the button and get everything set up.  I won't judge you for backing out.
</p><p>
I hope you've enjoyed this look into the past of the Previews and that you will consider contributing to its future.  In the meantime it's time for us to consider the present, with our normal service of six by-elections on 11th September 2025:
</p><p>
<h2>Wilmslow Lacey Green</h2>
</p><p>
<em>Cheshire East council; caused by the death of Residents of Wilmslow councillor Chris Hilliard.</em>
</p><p>
We'll start the week by travelling just to the south of Greater Manchester.  Here we find Wilmslow, which is the main town in Manchester's stockbroker belt and has a reputation as one of the poshest towns in north-west England.  The Lacey Green area, which lies in the north-west of the town to the north of the River Bollin, is a council estate and just under 20% of this ward's households are socially rented, but that still doesn't stop this ward having a commuter demographic.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/quarry-bank-mill.jpg" alt="Quarry Bank Mill" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Partly this is because Lacey Green ward also includes the parish of Styal to the north-west.  The boyhood home of Tyson Fury, Styal is best known to the outside world as the location of Quarry Bank Mill and its associated model village.  Now run by the National Trust as a museum, Quarry Bank Mill was founded in 1784 by Samuel Greg on the banks of the Bollin and became one of the largest cotton mills in the country.  It generated enough profit for the Greg family that Samuel's son Robert Hyde Greg was elected to Parliament in the days when you needed serious money to attempt that, and he served as a Whig MP for Manchester from 1839 to 1841 on a ticket of opposing workers' and union rights.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/ches-e-wilmslow-lacey-grn-2025.png" alt="Ches E, Wilmslow Lacey Grn" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
The National Trust have opened the Quarry Bank estate to the public, but significant other parts of Styal parish are off-limits.  The parish boundary takes in some of the land covered by Manchester Airport, including the north-eastern end of the second runway.  (This column will have more to say about the airport later this month.)  Also here is the reason that Wilmslow Lacey Green comes in just outside the top 100 wards in England and Wales in the "economically inactive: other" category: this is HMP Styal, a high-security women's prison which houses some of the UK's most notorious female offenders.
</p><p>

</p><p>
This ward was created in 2011 and it returned Conservative councillors until 2023, when a localist party entered the fray.  Chris Hilliard, the candidate of the Residents of Wilmslow, ended up defeating the previous Conservative councillor Don Stockton by 48-38.  This was a gain for the coalition administration of Labour, independent and localist councillors which has run Cheshire East council since 2019; the Conservatives are the largest party on the council, but they are short of a majority.
</p><p>
Having lost Wilmslow Lacey Green in 2023, the Conservatives nearly went on to lose the Tatton parliamentary seat which includes Wilmslow in 2024.  Esther McVey, who has represented the seat since 2017 and was in Sunak's final Cabinet as minister without portfolio, was re-elected for her third term of office just 1,136 votes ahead of Labour.
</p><p>
This by-election is to replace Chris Hilliard, who died in June at the appallingly young age of 37.  Hilliard was Cheshire East council's active travel champion, a role which built on the late councillor's day job in a bicycle shop.
</p><p>
Defending this seat for the Residents of Wilmslow is Wilmslow town councillor Elaine Evans.  The Conservatives have selected Khumi Burton, a former deputy lieutenant of Greater Manchester who has done a lot of voluntary work in her adoptive Wilmslow and in Styal.  Also on the ballot are Reform UK's Nick Goulding, who has stood twice for Parliament on the Reform UK or Brexit Party ticket and was Reform UK's candidate for Cheshire police and crime commissioner in 2021; Labour's Steve Greaney who is standing in his first election; and the Greens' Amanda Iremonger who stood in Knutsford ward in 2023 and in Macclesfield at last year's general election.  As in all six by-elections today, that gives us a ballot paper of five candidates.

<h2>Pelsall</h2>
</p><p>
<em>Walsall council, West Midlands; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Garry Perry.</em>
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/walsall-pelsall-2025.png" alt="Walsall, Pelsall" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
We now travel south to this week's first Conservative defence, which comes on the northern edge of the Black Country a few miles to the north of Walsall.  The village of Pelsall is first attested in a charter of 994, when a Mercian noblewoman called Wulfrun gave it and other lands to a monastery in modern-day Wolverhampton.  In the 1086 Domesday survey Pelsall was described as "waste", but things have changed since.
</p><p>
The catalyst for this change was the construction of the Wyrley and Essington Canal in 1794 and the discovery of coal in the area, which was quickly exploited.  Pelsall became the location of a large ironworks, and nailmaking was also an important local industry.  All this is gone now, and the old ironworks site has been turned into a nature reserve.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/pelsall-signpost.jpg" alt="Signpost, Pelsall" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
This ward is one of the whiter and better-off parts of the Black Country.  In Walsall council elections Pelsall is a bastion for the Conservative Party, who last lost a local election here in 2000 (to the Lib Dems) and have grown a strong vote in the ward over the last two decades.  The presence of two long-serving councillors, Garry Perry (first elected in 1998) and Marco Longhi (first elected in 1999) will have helped in this.  Longhi left Walsall council in 2021 after being elected to Parliament as the Conservative MP for Dudley North, while Perry worked his way up to become mayor of the borough in 2010-11 and eventually leader of Walsall council in June 2024.  Unfortunately it seems that being in the top job was not a happy experience for Garry Perry: he resigned as leader in May this year and then quit the council altogether at the start of August, with both of his resignation statements having a common theme of frustration and disillusionment.
</p><p>
Perry was re-elected for his eighth term of office in 2024 with a large lead of 67-19 over Labour.  This Conservative dominance also extends to parliamentary level, where Pelsall is part of a parliamentary seat named after an urban district which was created 59 years ago and abolished 51 years ago.  The Aldridge-Brownhills constituency has tracked strongly to the right since its creation in 1974, and it has been in Conservative hands continuously since 1979.  Even in 2024 this seat was safe enough for its re-elected Conservative MP Wendy Morton, who has served since 2015 and whose one and only Cabinet role was as Liz Truss' chief whip.
</p><p>
The winner of this Pelsall by-election will not be able to rest on their laurels for long, because forthcoming ward boundary changes mean that the whole of Walsall council will be up for re-election next year.  Defending for the Conservatives is Lee Chapman, a mechanical engineer and Army veteran who gives an address in the ward: he has previously stood in Walsall council elections for Reform UK and as an independent candidate.  Labour have selected Hannah Jones, who previously stood in 2022 in another safe Conservative ward of Walsall, Pheasey Park Farm.  Also on the ballot are former Walsall Conservative councillor (1992-96, 2003-04) Graham Eardley who has stood in this ward in every election since 2016, originally for UKIP but since 2021 for Reform UK; former Walsall councillor Dan Barker for the Liberal Democrats; and Joe Belcher for the Green Party.

<h2>Newmarket East</h2>
</p><p>
<em>West Suffolk council; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Susan Perry.</em>
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/w-suffolk-newmarket-e-2025.png" alt="W Suffolk, Newmarket E" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
We now come to two Labour defences in smallish towns in the east of England.  By far the better-known of these is Newmarket, which is the centre of the UK's horseracing industry.  If thoroughbred horses had the vote, then Newmarket East ward - which covers most of the town centre including the Jockey Club, the National Horse Racing Museum and a number of large stables along the Fordham Road and the Bury Road - would be a lot smaller than it is.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/jockey-club.jpg" alt="Jockey Club, Newmarket" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
The 2021 census return for Newmarket was restricted to the town's human residents.  Newmarket East ranks 6th in England and Wales for residents born in British overseas territories (0.5%), and 8th for residents working in the "arts, entertainment and recreation" sector (7.6%) which presumably covers the jobs directly linked to horseracing.  Both of these are the highest figures for any ward in the Eastern region.
</p><p>
The town of Newmarket was once divided by the county boundary between Suffolk and Cambridgeshire, which ran down the middle of the high street: Suffolk to the north, Cambridgeshire to the south.  Local government reform in 1889 forced the town to pick a side, and since the northern half of the town was larger Newmarket became part of Suffolk while almost all of the countryside around it remained in Cambridgeshire.  This curious salient remains to this day, because proposals to transfer Newmarket to Cambridgeshire as part of the 1974 reorganisation came to nothing despite support from the urban district council.
</p><p>
Since 1997 Newmarket has been part of the Conservative-held West Suffolk constituency, which returned Theresa May's former chief of staff Nick Timothy to Parliament in 2024.  Timothy took the seat over from the COVID-era health secretary Matt Hancock, who had lost the Conservative whip in 2022 for his appearance on <em>I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!</em>
</p><p>
Further local government reorganisation in 2019 means that the local authority for Newmarket is now West Suffolk council, which is based some distance to the east in Bury St Edmunds.  This is run by a Labour-led rainbow coalition, after the Conservatives lost control of the council in 2023.
</p><p>
One of the seats which the Conservatives lost then was in Newmarket East ward, where all six candidates finished within 113 votes of each other.  Top of the poll was the Labour candidate Susan Perry on 358 votes, with the second seat going in a photofinish to re-elected Conservative councillor Rachel Hood on 317 votes.  Hood won by a majority of 8 over the Lib Dem candidate Jonny Edge, who finished three votes ahead of the ward's other Conservative councillor Robert Nobbs who lost his seat.  Vote shares, for what they are worth in this pileup of a result, were 24% for Labour, 21% for the Conservatives, 20% for the Liberal Democrats, 19% for the West Suffolk Independents and 16% for an independent candidate.
</p><p>
We don't have any county council results from 2025 to compare this to, because the scheduled Suffolk county elections were postponed.  Newmarket East ward's remaining Conservative councillor Rachel Hood is also the county councillor for Exning and Newmarket division, but the ward also includes part of Newmarket and Red Lodge division which previously appeared in this column in 2016 and 2020.  The former by-election was won by the Conservatives' Robin Millar, who then resigned from Suffolk county council immediately upon his election as a Conservative MP in North Wales in 2019.  His Conservative successor Andy Drummond was safely re-elected for in 2021 and is now 4 years and 4 months into a four-year term of office.
</p><p>
The resignation of Labour councillor Sue Perry leaves a difficult defence for the party's new runner in today's renewal of the Newmarket East Stakes.  Graham Creelman comes to elected politics from a successful career in broadcasting and political journalism, which saw him rise to become managing director of the local ITV franchise Anglia Television and then pro-chancellor of Norwich University of the Arts.  He was appointed OBE in the 2006 Birthday Honours for services to broadcasting.  The Conservatives have selected hotel manager Robert Nobbs, who lost his seat here in 2023 and wants it back: Nobbs has previously appeared in this column in 2017, when he won the last by-election to Forest Heath council.  Running in the yellow colours of the Liberal Democrats is Caroline Revitt, who is described as a retired business professional and trained teacher.  This time there is no West Suffolk Independent candidate and the independent from last time is also a non-runner, so there are a lot of votes up for grabs here: two candidates from parties which didn't enter the race here last time, the Green Party's Danny Kent and Reform UK's Adrian Whittle, may hope to capitalise on that.  That completes your card of five runners, and good look finding a bookie who'll take a bet on the outcome of this race.

</p><p>
We now travel west from Newmarket to arrive at one of England's more obscure towns.  Stotfold lies just off the northern end of Hertfordshire section of the A1(M) motorway, which gives up at the county boundary when the A1 crosses over into Bedfordshire.  The town appears to have developed at a point close to the River Ivel where cattle drovers would break their journey along the Great North Road: "stot" is an old word for an ox or bull.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/c-beds-stotfold-2025.png" alt="C Beds, Stotfold" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Stotfold has seen strong population growth in this century, particularly in the new development of Fairfield to the south-west which has declared independence from the town in recent years to become a parish of its own.  The present Stotfold ward, created for the 2023 election with two councillors, does not include Fairfield.
</p><p>
Despite its status as a Bedfordshire town, Stotfold has a Hertfordshire postcode because its post is delivered from Hitchin to the south.  In a turn of events brought about by rules on the maximum and minimum sizes for Parliamentary seats, the 2024 boundary review reflected this by transferring Stotfold out of the North East Bedfordshire constituency into a Hitchin seat that straddles the Hertfordshire-Bedfordshire border.  This was won in July 2024 by Labour's Alistair Strathern, who had entered Parliament nine months previously by winning the Mid Bedfordshire by-election after Nadine Dorries left Parliament.  He lives in the town of Shefford, which was moved from Mid Bedfordshire to Hitchin by the boundary changes.

</p><p>
The Conservatives' loss of the Mid Bedfordshire by-election in October 2023 followed on from their losing control of Central Bedfordshire council five months previously.  On new ward boundaries that council election returned 27 independent councillors, 20 Conservatives, 10 Lib Dems, 5 Labour and a Green councillor; independent councillors formed and run a minority administration.  All previous wards covering Stotfold had only returned Conservative members of Central Bedfordshire council since its first election in 2008, but in 2023 the new Stotfold ward split its two seats between independent Kathryn Woodfine, who was way ahead at the top of the poll with 44%, and Labour's Helen Wightwick who polled 24%.  The Tories' Steven Dixon, with 20%, finished as runner-up.
</p><p>
The by-election to replace resigning Labour councillor Helen Wightwick has no independent candidate, so there are a lot of votes up for grabs and whoever wins this by-election will join the opposition ranks on Central Bedfordshire council.  Defending for Labour is Rachel Burgin, a chartered company secretary who was the party's parliamentary candidate for Hitchin and Harpenden in 2015.  The Conservatives' Ian Dalgarno is a former deputy police and crime commissioner for Bedfordshire and was a long-serving former councillor who lost his seat in 2023; he previously represented Arlesey ward on the old Mid Bedfordshire council from 2007 to 2009, before being elected to Central Bedfordshire council for Stotfold and Arlesey ward from 2008 to 2011 and Arlesey from 2011 to 2023.  Also on the ballot are Neil Stevenson for the Lib Dems, Kate Hill-Lines for the Greens and Marion Mason for Reform UK.

<h2>Illtyd</h2>
</p><p>
<em>Vale of Glamorgan council; caused by the death of Labour councillor Howard Hamilton.</em>
</p><p>
For our final Labour defence of the week we are in Wales' southernmost town, Barry, which is the largest town in the Vale of Glamorgan district.  This was one of many towns in South Wales created by the coal industry, although there were no mines here: instead Barry was seen as an excellent location for a seaport to export the black gold from Wales.  This industry also spawned the seaside resort of Barry Island, which was a genuine island before it was joined to the Welsh mainland by the development of the docks.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/vale-glamorgan-illtyd-2025.png" alt="Bro Morgannwg, Illtud" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Illtyd ward is a residential area on the western edge of Barry, ranging from Victorian buildings on the High Street to more modern housing development in Cwm Talwg along the Pontypridd Road.  It includes the Barry campus of Cardiff and Vale College, which is the town's main centre for further education.  This is one of a number of Barry's electoral wards which are named after saints: the eponymous St Illtud was a fifth-century figure who served as a knight in King Arthur's court before founding Britain's first Christian centre of learning at the nearby town of Llantwit Major.  Among his pupils were St David and St Patrick, the patron saints of Wales and Ireland.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/barry-pontypridd-road.jpg" alt="Pontypridd Rd, Barry" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Cwm Talwg is a particularly well-off part of Barry, and in this century Illtyd ward has generally returned Conservative councillors to Vale of Glamorgan council.  Although Labour did win the ward in 2012, it seems that they were caught off guard by the 2022 result here - 40% for Labour, 29% for the Conservatives, 18% for Plaid Cymru - and the Labour slate only had two candidates for the three available seats, which allowed the Conservatives to hold on to one of the seats they were defending.  A third Labour seat here would certainly have been useful, because Labour do not have a majority on Vale of Glamorgan council and they are having to run the show in coalition with a Llantwit Major localist party.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2022/vale-glamorgan22s.svgz" alt="Vale of Glamorgan, 2022" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
In Westminster elections the Vale of Glamorgan constituency has voted for the government at every election since its creation in 1983 with the exception of a Labour win at a 1989 by-election.  Its Conservative MP throughout the 2010-24 administration was Alun Cairns, who served as Welsh secretary for three years under Cameron, May and Johnson.  Cairns was defeated in 2024 by Kanishka Narayan, who came to Cardiff from his native India at the age of 12 before attending Eton (on a scholarship) and Oxford.  Narayan is Wales' first MP from any ethnic minority.
</p><p>
By contrast, the Senedd Vale of Glamorgan constituency has had just one MS throughout its existence.  Jane Hutt has represented the seat since the first Assembly election in 1999 and she has been on the frontbench for nearly all of that time, serving in the Cabinet under all six First Ministers to date (Michael, Rhodri Morgan, Jones, Drakeford, Gething and Eluned Morgan).  Hutt currently has three jobs in the Welsh Cabinet, juggling the social justice portfolio with her roles as Trefnydd (or Leader of the Senedd) and chief whip.
</p><p>
Next year's Senedd electoral reform will combine the Vale with Bridgend to form a new constituency called Pen-y-bont Bro Morgannwg, returning six MSs by proportional representation.  That area would notionally have three Labour seats, two Conservatives and one for Reform UK based on the votes cast in last year's Westminster election.
</p><p>
Before then Labour have to defend a by-election in Illtyd ward to replace the late Howard Hamilton.  Hamilton was first elected to Barry town council in 2008, and he was a Vale of Glamorgan councillor from 2012 to 2017 and again from 2022 until his death in July.  He had served as mayor on both local authorities, and his interests in supporting and advocating for the disabled and the young were reflected by his roles on the executive of the Wales Council for the Blind and by many years of work with the local branch of the YMCA.
</p><p>
Defending this seat for Labour is Aled Blake, who is standing in his first election.  The Conservatives have selected Vincent Bailey, a former Vale of Glamorgan council for Dyfan ward in northern Barry who lost his seat in 2022.  Returning for Plaid Cymru is town councillor Dave "Taif" Ball who has fought this ward at every election since 2008; Ball is described as one of Europe's premier bass guitar players, and he has played with musicians including Jools Holland, David Knopfler, Vanessa Mae and Suggs and in musical genres ranging from jazz to death metal.  Also on the ballot here are Aoife Blight for the Green Party and Brandon Dodd for Reform UK, who can't have expected to be bottom of the ballot paper with that surname.

<h2>Talbot and Branksome Woods</h2>
</p><p>
<em>Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole council, Dorset; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Philip Broadhead.</em>
</p><p>
We finish for the week on the south coast, in a town which will be the focus of much political attention over the next month when first the Liberal Democrats and then the Green Party of England and Wales hold their annual conferences in Bournemouth.  Before then, the local political focus is on a by-election just north-west of Bournemouth town centre.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/bcp-talbot-branksome-woods-2025.png" alt="Bournemouth/Christchurch/Poole, Talbot/Branksome Woods" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Talbot and Branksome Woods ward covers quite a diverse area.  The Branksome Woods part of the ward name refers to Branksome Wood Road, which lies in the valley of the River Bourne.  The area around the Bourne in Bournemouth is mostly given over to three sets of gardens, and this ward includes the whole of the Upper Gardens: these are described by the council as "the quietest of the three gardens" with "a more natural feel and planting, featuring European, Asian and North American plant species. The gardens' Giant Redwood is believed to be the largest in the country."
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/bournemouth-upper-gardens.jpg" alt="Ur Gdns, Bournemouth" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
To the south of the Upper Gardens we find housing along Surrey Road and Princess Road, which are divided from each other by a large train maintenance depot for South Western Railway.  This depot is the remaining part of the branch line into the now-vanished Bournemouth West terminus, and there was once a triangular junction at Branksome to allow trains from London to reach Bournemouth West.  These days that curve has gone, and trains accessing the depot have to reverse in from Branksome railway station at the south-west corner of this ward.
</p><p>
In the north of the ward we find Talbot Heath School, a girls' boarding school whose former pupils include Shirley Williams; the Talbot Woods residential area around Talbot Avenue; the main Talbot campus of Bournemouth University, whose MP alumni include the much-missed Sir David Amess and the present Poole MP Neil Duncan-Jordan; the neighbouring campus of the Arts University Bournemouth; and the new Talbot Village, an area of newer housing along Fern Barrow next to the site of the two universities. All of these names trace back to Georgina and Mary Talbot, a pair of wealthy nineteenth-century sisters from Surrey who set aside land just of the north of the ward to create the original Talbot Village, a series of cottages built between 1850 and 1862 by and for the unemployed parishioners of what was then the parish of Kinson.  Ironically, Talbot Woods itself is not part of Talbot and Branksome Woods ward.
</p><p>
This area is part of the Bournemouth West parliamentary seat, where the rather right-wing Conservative MP Sir Conor Burns lost his seat last year to the seat's first Labour MP Jessica Toale.  Toale had previously been a Westminster councillor, and when she quit her seat on that council last year the Conservatives gained the resulting by-election in West End ward.
</p><p>
Labour are not much of a factor in Bournemouth's local elections.  Talbot and Branksome Woods ward was safely Conservative at the first elections to the cumbersomely-named Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole council in 2019, but in 2023 this ward turned in a close result with 35% for the Lib Dems, 32% for the Conservatives and 12% each for the Greens and Labour.  Much of the Lib Dem score was a personal vote for their lead candidate Matthew Gillett which didn't sufficiently transfer to his colleagues, and this meant that despite the deficit in votes the Conservatives won the seat count in this ward 2-1.  Philip Broadhead, who was the Conservative leader of BCP council going into that election, won the third and final seat just five votes ahead of the second Lib Dem candidate.  BCP council is hung, with the Liberal Democrats as the largest party: they run the council in coalition with a number of localist groups.
</p><p>
The Conservatives have a difficult by-election to defend here following the resignation of Philip Broadhead, who had remained as leader of the Conservative group after they went into opposition in 2023.  Broadhead, who had represented this ward since 2015 on both BCP council and the predecessor Bournemouth council, is moving to the United Arab Emirates where his wife is taking up a new job.
</p><p>
The defending Conservative candidate here is Jo Keeling, who is chair of the Talbot Village Residents' Association; Keeling previously had 20 years' service in the police before being forced to retire on medical grounds.  The Lib Dems have selected Dawn Logan, a businesswoman who has previously worked as a chemical engineer and in the health and social care sector.  Keeling and Logan are standing in their first election as is the Greens' Amy Hardy, who credits her neighbours and community for helping in her struggles with disability and now wants to give something back to the community.  Standing for Labour is another electoral first-timer in Charlie Cushway, who recently refounded the debating society at the University of Kent.  Completing the ballot is Reform UK's Martin Houlden, who has a number of previous parliamentary campaigns under his belt (most recently as Reform UK candidate for Bournemouth East last year) but is standing at local council level for the first time.
