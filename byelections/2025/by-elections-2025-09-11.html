Six by-elections on 11th September 2025:

<h2>Wilmslow Lacey Green</h2>

Cheshire East council; caused by the death of Residents of Wilmslow councillor Chris Hilliard.

We'll start the week by travelling just to the south of Greater Manchester.  Here we find Wilmslow, which is the main town in Manchester's stockbroker belt and has a reputation as one of the poshest towns in north-west England.  The Lacey Green area, which lies in the north-west of the town to the north of the River Bollin, is a council estate and just under 20% of this ward's households are socially rented, but that still doesn't stop this ward having a commuter demographic.

Partly this is because Lacey Green ward also includes the parish of Styal to the north-west.  The boyhood home of Tyson Fury, Styal is best known as the location of Quarry Bank Mill and its associated model village.  Now run by the National Trust as a museum, Quarry Bank Mill was founded in 1784 by Samuel Greg on the banks of the Bollin and became one of the largest cotton mills in the country.  It generated enough profit for the Greg family that Samuel's son Robert Hyde Greg was elected to Parliament in the days when you needed serious money to do that, and he served as a Whig MP for Manchester from 1839 to 1841 on a ticket of opposing workers' and union rights.

The National Trust have opened the Quarry Bank estate to the public, but significant other parts of Styal parish are off-limits.  The parish boundary takes in some of the land covered by Manchester Airport, including the north-eastern end of the second runway.  (This column will have more to say about the airport later this month.)  Also here is the reason that Wilmslow Lacey Green comes in just outside the top 100 wards in England and Wales in the "economically inactive: other" category: this is HMP Styal, a high-security women's prison which houses some of the UK's most notorious female offenders.

This ward was created in 2011 and it returned Conservative councillors until 2023, when a localist party entered the fray.  Chris Hilliard, the candidate of the Residents of Wilmslow, ended up defeating the previous Conservative councillor Don Stockton by 48-38.  This was a gain for the coalition administration of Labour, independent and localist councillors which has run Cheshire East council since 2019; the Conservatives are the largest party on the council, but they are short of a majority.

Having lost Wilmslow Lacey Green in 2023, the Conservatives nearly went on to lose the Tatton parliamentary seat which includes Wilmslow in 2024.  Esther McVey, who has represented the seat since 2017 and was in Sunak's final Cabinet as minister without portfolio, was re-elected for her third term of office just 1,136 votes ahead of Labour.

This by-election is to replace Chris Hilliard, who died in June at the appallingly young age of 37.  Hilliard was Cheshire East council's active travel champion, a role which built on the late councillor's day job in a bicycle shop.

Defending this seat for the Residents of Wilmslow is Wilmslow town councillor Elaine Evans.  The Conservatives have selected Khumi Burton, a former deputy lieutenant of Greater Manchester who has done a lot of voluntary work in her adoptive Wilmslow and in Styal.  Also on the ballot are Reform UK's Nick Goulding, who has stood twice for Parliament on the Reform UK or Brexit Party ticket and was Reform UK's candidate for Cheshire police and crime commissioner in 2021; Labour's Steve Greaney who is standing in his first election; and the Greens' Amanda Iremonger who stood in Knutsford ward in 2023 and in Macclesfield at last year's general election.  As in all six by-elections today, that gives us a ballot paper of five candidates.

<h2>Pelsall</h2>

Walsall council, West Midlands; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Garry Perry.

We now travel south to this week's first Conservative defence, which comes on the northern edge of the Black Country a few miles to the north of Walsall.  The village of Pelsall is first attested in a charter of 994, when a Mercian noblewoman called Wulfrun gave it and other lands to a monastery in modern-day Wolverhampton.  In the 1086 Domesday survey Pelsall was described as "waste", but things have changed since.

The catalyst for this change was the construction of the Wyrley and Essington Canal in 1794 and the discovery of coal in the area, which was quickly exploited.  Pelsall became the location of a large ironworks, and nailmaking was also an important local industry.  All this is gone now, and the old ironworks site has been turned into a nature reserve.

This is one of the whiter and better-off parts of the Black Country.  In Walsall council elections Pelsall is a bastion for the Conservative Party, who last lost a local election here in 2000 (to the Lib Dems) and have grown a strong vote in the ward over the last two decades.  The presence of two long-serving councillors, Garry Perry (first elected in 1998) and Marco Longhi (first elected in 1999) will have helped in this.  Longhi left Walsall council in 2021 after being elected to Parliament as the Conservative MP for Dudley North, while Perry worked his way up to become mayor of the borough in 2010-11 and eventually leader of Walsall council in June 2024.  Unfortunately it seems that being in the top job was not a happy experience for Garry Perry: he resigned as leader in May this year and then quit the council altogether at the start of the August, with both of his resignation statements having a common theme of frustration and disillusionment.

Perry was re-elected for his eighth term of office in 2024 with a large lead of 67-19 over Labour.  This Conservative dominance also extends to parliamentary level, where Pelsall is part of a parliamentary seat named after an urban district which was created 59 years ago and abolished 51 years ago.  The Aldridge-Brownhills constituency has tracked strongly to the right since its creation in 1974, and it has been in Conservative hands continuously since 1979; even in 2024 it was safe enough for its re-elected Conservative MP Wendy Morton, who has served since 2015 and whose one and only Cabinet role was as Liz Truss' chief whip.

The winner of this Pelsall by-election will not be able to rest on their laurels for long, because ward boundary changes mean that the whole of Walsall council will be up for re-election next year.  Defending for the Conservatives is Lee Chapman, a mechanical engineer and Army veteran who gives an address in the ward: he has previously stood in Walsall council elections for Reform UK and as an independent candidate.  Labour have selected Hannah Jones, who previously stood in 2022 in another safe Conservative ward of Walsall, Pheasey Park Farm.  Also on the ballot are Graham Eardley who has stood in this ward in every election since 2016, originally for UKIP but since 2021 for Reform UK; Dan Barker for the Liberal Democrats; and Joe Belcher for the Green Party.

<h2>Newmarket East</h2>

West Suffolk council; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Susan Perry.

We now come to two Labour defences in smallish towns in the east of England.  By far the better-known of these is Newmarket, which is the centre of the UK's horseracing industry.  If thoroughbred horses had the vote, then Newmarket East ward - which covers most of the town centre along with the National Horse Racing Museum and a number of large stables along the Fordham Road and the Bury Road - would be a lot smaller than it is.

The 2021 census return for Newmarket was restricted to the town's human residents.  Newmarket East ranks 6th in England and Wales for residents born in British overseas territories (0.5%), and 8th for residents working in the "arts, entertainment and recreation" sector (7.6%) which presumably covers the jobs directly linked to horseracing.  Both of these are the highest figures for any ward in the Eastern region.

The town of Newmarket was once divided by the county boundary between Suffolk and Cambridgeshire, which ran down the middle of the high street: Suffolk to the north, Cambridgeshire to the south.  Local government reform in 1889 forced the town to pick a side, and since the northern side of the town was larger Newmarket became part of Suffolk while almost all of the countryside remained in Cambridgeshire.  This curious salient remains to this day, as proposals to transfer Newmarket to Cambridgeshire as part of the 1974 reorganisation came to nothing despite support from the urban district council.

Since 1997 Newmarket has been part of the Conservative-held West Suffolk constituency, which returned Theresa May's former chief of staff Nick Timothy to Parliament in 2024.  Timothy took the seat over from the COVID-era health secretary Matt Hancock, who had lost the Conservative whip in 2022 for his appearance on <em>I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!</em>

Further local government reorgansation in 2019 means that the local authority for Newmarket is now West Suffolk council, which is based some distance to the east in Bury St Edmunds.  This is run by a Labour-led rainbow coalition, after the Conservatives lost control of the council in 2023.

One of the seats which the Conservatives lost then was in Newmarket East ward, where all six candidates finished within 113 votes of each other.  Top of the poll was the Labour candidate Susan Perry on 358 votes, with the second seat going to re-elected Conservative councillor Rachel Hood on 317 votes.  Hood won by a majority of 8 over the Lib Dem candidate Jonny Edge, who finished three votes ahead of the ward's other Conservative councillor Robert Nobbs who lost his seat.  Vote shares, for what they are worth in this pileup of a result, were 24% for Labour, 21% for the Conservatives, 20% for the Liberal Democrats, 19% for the West Suffolk Independents and 16% for an independent candidate.

We don't have any county council results from 2025 to compare this to, because the scheduled Suffolk county elections were postponed.  Newmarket East ward's remaining Conservative councillor Rachel Hood is also the county councillor for Exning and Newmarket division, but the ward also includes part of Newmarket and Red Lodge division which previously appeared in this column in 2016 and 2020.  The former by-election was won by the Conservatives' Robin Millar, who then resigned from Suffolk county council immediately upon his election as a Conservative MP in North Wales in 2019.  His Conservative successor Andy Drummond was safely re-elected for in 2021 and is now 4 years and 4 months into a four-year term of office.

The resignation of Labour councillor Sue Perry leaves a difficult defence for the party's new candidate.  Graham Creelman comes to elected politics from a successful career in broadcasting and political journalism, which saw him rise to become managing director of the local ITV franchise Anglia Television and then pro-chancellor of Norwich University of the Arts.  He was appointed OBE in the 2006 Birthday Honours for services to broadcasting.  The Conservatives have selected hotel manager Robert Nobbs, who lost his seat here in 2023 and wants it back: Nobbs has previously appeared in this column in 2017, when he won the last by-election to Forest Heath council.  Standing for the Liberal Democrats is Caroline Revitt, who is described as a retired business professional and trained teacher.  This time there is no West Suffolk Independent candidate and the independent from last time has not returned either, so there are a lot of votes up for grabs here: two candidates from parties which didn't stand here last time, the Green Party's Danny Kent and Reform UK's Adrian Whittle, may hope to capitalise on that.

<h2>Stotfold</h2>

Central Bedfordshire council; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Helen Wightwick.

We now travel west from Newmarket to arrive at one of England's more obscure towns.  Stotfold lies just off the northern end of Hertfordshire section of the A1(M) motorway, which gives up at the county boundary when the A1 crosses over into Bedfordshire.  The town appears to have developed at a point close to the River Ivel where cattle drovers would break their journey along the Great North Road: "stot" is an old word for an ox or bull.  Stotfold has seen strong population growth in this century, and the new development of Fairfield to the south-west has declared independence in recent years and become a parish of its own: the present Stotfold ward, created for the 2023 election with two councillors, does not include Fairfield.

Despite its status as a Bedfordshire town, Stotfold has a Hertfordshire postcode because its post is delivered from Hitchin to the south.  In a turn of events brought about by rules on the maximum and minimum sizes for Parliamentary seats, the 2024 boundary review reflected this by transferring Stotfold out of the North East Bedfordshire constituency into a Hitchin seat that straddles the Hertfordshire-Bedfordshire border.  This was won in July 2024 by Labour's Alistair Strathern, who had entered Parliament nine months previously by winning the Mid Bedfordshire by-election after Nadine Dorries left Parliament.  He lives in the town of Shefford, which was moved from Mid Bedfordshire to Hitchin by the boundary changes.

The Conservatives' loss of the Mid Bedfordshire by-election in October 2023 followed on from losing control of Central Bedfordshire council five months previously.  On new ward boundaries that council election returned 27 independent councillors, 20 Conservatives, 10 Lib Dems, 5 Labour and a Green councillor; independent councillors formed and run a minority administration.  All previous wards covering Stotfold had only returned Conservative members of Central Bedfordshire council since its first election in 2008, but in 2023 the new Stotfold ward split its two seats between independent Kathryn Woodfine, who was way ahead at the top of the poll with 44%, and Labour's Helen Wightwick who polled 24%.  The Tories' Steven Dixon, with 20%, finished as runner-up.

The by-election to replace resigning Labour councillor Helen Wightwick has no independent candidate, so there are a lot of votes up for grabs and whoever wins this by-election will join the opposition ranks on Central Bedfordshire council.  Defending for Labour is Rachel Burgin, a chartered company secretary who was the party's parliamentary candidate for Hitchin and Harpenden in 2015.  The Conservatives' Ian Dalgarno is a former deputy police and crime commissioner for Bedfordshire and was a long-serving former councillor who lost his seat in 2023; he previously represented Arlesey ward on the old Mid Bedfordshire council from 2007 to 2009, before being elected to Central Bedfordshire councillor for Stotfold and Arlesey ward from 2008 to 2011 and Arlesey from 2011 to 2023.  Also on the ballot are Neil Stevenson for the Lib Dems, Kate Hill-Lines for the Greens and Marion Mason for Reform UK.

<h2>Illtyd</h2>

Vale of Glamorgan council; caused by the death of Labour councillor Howard Hamilton.

For our final Labour defence of the week we are in Wales' southernmost town, Barry, which is the largest town in the Vale of Glamorgan district.  This was one of many towns in South Wales created by the coal industry, although there were no mines here: instead Barry was seen as an excellent location for a seaport to export the black gold from Wales.  This industry also spawned the seaside resort of Barry Island, which was joined to the Welsh mainland by the development of the docks.

Illtyd ward is a residential area on the western edge of Barry, ranging from Victorian buildings on the High Street to more modern housing development in Cwm Talwg along the Pontypridd Road.  It includes the Barry campus of Cardiff and Vale College, which is the town's main centre for further education.  This is one of a number of Barry's electoral wards which are named after saints: the eponymous St Illtud was a fifth-century figure who served as a knight in King Arthur's court before founding Britain's first Christian centre of learning at the nearby town of Llantwit Major.  Among his pupils were St David and St Patrick, the patron saints of Wales and Ireland.

Cwm Talwg is a particularly well-off part of Barry, and in this century Illtyd ward has generally returned Conservative councillors to Vale of Glamorgan council.  Although Labour did win the ward in 2012, it seems that they were caught off guard by the 2022 result here - 40% for Labour, 29% for the Conservatives, 18% for Plaid Cymru - and the Labour slate only had two candidates for the three available seats, which allowed the Conservatives to hold on to one of the seats they were defending.  A third Labour seat here would certainly have been useful, because Labour do not have a majority on Vale of Glamorgan council and they are having to run the show in coalition with a Llantwit Major localist party.

In Westminster elections the Vale of Glamorgan constituency has voted for the government at every election since its creation in 1983 with the exception of a Labour win at a 1989 by-election.  Its Conservative MP throughout the 2010-24 administration was Alun Cairns, who served as Welsh secretary for three years under Cameron, May and Johnson.  Cairns was defeated in 2024 by Kanishka Narayan, who came to Cardiff from his native India at the age of 12 before attending Eton (on a scholarship) and Oxford.  Narayan is Wales' first MP from any ethnic minority.

By contrast, the Senedd Vale of Glamorgan constituency has had just one MS throughout its existence.  Jane Hutt has represented the seat since the first Assembly election in 1999 and she has been on the frontbench for nearly all of that time, serving in the Cabinet under all six First Ministers to date (Michael, Rhodri Morgan, Jones, Drakeford, Gething and Eluned Morgan).  Hutt currently has three jobs in the Welsh Cabinet, juggling the social justice portfolio with her roles as Trefnydd (or Leader of the Senedd) and chief whip.

Next year's Senedd electoral reform will combine the Vale with Bridgend.  The resulting six-seat constituency of Pen-y-bont Bro Morgannwg would notionally have three Labour seats, two Conservatives and one for Reform UK based on the votes cast in last year's Westminster election.

Before then Labour have to defend a by-election in Illtyd ward to replace the late Howard Hamilton.  Hamilton was first elected to Barry town council in 2008, and he was a Vale of Glamorgan councillor from 2012 to 2017 and again from 2022 until his death in July.  He had served as mayor on both local authorities, and his interests in supporting and advocating for the disabled and the young were reflected by his roles on the executive of the Wales Council for the Blind and by many years of work with the local branch of the YMCA.

Defending this seat for Labour is Aled Blake, who is standing in his first election.  The Conservatives have selected Vincent Bailey, a former Vale of Glamorgan council for Dyfan ward in northern Barry who lost his seat in 2022.  Returning for Plaid Cymru is town councillor Dave "Taif" Ball who has fought this ward at every election since 2008; Ball is described as one of Europe's premier bass guitar players, and he has played with musicians including Jools Holland, David Knopfler, Vanessa Mae and Suggs and in musical genres ranging from jazz to death metal.  Also on the ballot here are Aoife Blight for the Green Party and Brandon Dodd for Reform UK, who can't have expected to be bottom of the ballot paper with that surname.

<h2>Talbot and Branksome Woods</h2>

Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole council, Dorset; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Philip Broadhead.

We finish for the week on the south coast, in a town which will be the focus of much political attention over the next month when first the Liberal Democrats and then the Green Party hold their annual conferences in Bournemouth.  Before then, the local political focus is on a by-election just north-west of Bournemouth town centre.

Talbot and Branksome Woods ward covers quite a diverse area.  The Branksome Woods part of the ward name refers to Branksome Wood Road, which lies in the valley of the River Bourne.  The area around the Bourne is mostly given over to three sets of gardens, and this ward includes the whole of the Upper Gardens: these are described by the council as "the quietest of the three gardens" with "a more natural feel and planting, featuring European, Asian and North American plant species. The gardens' Giant Redwood is believed to be the largest in the country."

To the south of the Upper Gardens we find housing along Surrey Road and Princess Road, which are divided from each other by a large train maintenance depot for South Western Railway.  This depot is the remaining part of the branch line into the now-vanished Bournemouth West terminus, and there was once a triangular junction at Branksome to allow trains from London to reach Bournemouth West; these days, trains accessing the depot have to reverse in from Branksome railway station, which is at the south-west corner of this ward.

In the north of the ward we find Talbot Heath School, a girls' boarding school whose former pupils include Shirley Williams; the Talbot Woods residential area around Talbot Avenue; the main Talbot campus of Bournemouth University, whose MP alumni include the much-missed Sir David Amess and the present Poole MP Neil Duncan-Jordan; the neighbouring campus of the Arts University Bournemouth; and the new Talbot Village, an area of newer housing along Fern Barrow next to the site of the two universities. All of these names trace back to Georgina and Mary Talbot, a pair of wealthy nineteenth-century sisters from Surrey who set aside land just of the north of the ward to create the original Talbot Village, a series of cottages built between 1850 and 1862 by and for the unemployed parishioners of what was then the parish of Kinson.  Ironically, Talbot Woods itself is not part of Talbot and Bramksome Woods ward.

This area is part of the Bournemouth West parliamentary seat, where the rather right-wing Conservative MP Sir Conor Burns lost his seat last year to the seat's first Labour MP Jessica Asato.  Asato had previously been a Westminster councillor, and when she quit her seat on that council last year the Conservatives gained the resulting by-election in West End ward.

Labour are not much of a factor in Bournemouth's local elections.  Talbot and Branksome Woods ward was safely Conservative at the first elections to the cumbersomely-named Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole council in 2019, but in 2023 this ward turned in a close result with 35% for the Lib Dems, 32% for the Conservatives and 12% each for the Greens and Labour.  Much of the Lib Dem score was a personal vote for their lead candidate Matthew Gillett which didn't sufficiently transfer to his colleagues, and this meant that despite the deficit in votes the Conservatives won the seat count in this ward 2-1.  Philip Broadhead, who was the Consevative leader of BCP council going into that election, won the third and final seat just five votes ahead of the second Lib Dem candidate.  BCP council is hung, with the Liberal Democrats as the largest party: they run the council in coalition with a number of localist groups.

The Conservatives have a difficult by-election to defend here following the resignation of Philip Broadhead, who had remained as leader of the Conservative group after they went into opposition in 2023.  Broadhead, who had represented this ward since 2015 on both BCP and the predecessor Bournemouth council, is moving to the United Arab Emirates where his wife is taking up a new job.

The defending Conservative candidate here is Jo Keeling, who is chair of the Talbot Village Residents' Association; Keeling previously had 20 years' service in the police before being forced to retire on medical grounds.  The Lib Dems have selected Dawn Logan, a businesswoman who has previously worked as a chemical engineer and in the health and social care sector.  Keeling and Logan are standing in their first election as is the Greens' Amy Hardy, who credits her neighbours and community for helping in her struggles with disability and now wants to give something back to the community.  Standing for Labour is another electoral first-timer in Charlie Cushway, who recently refounded the debating society at the University of Kent.  Completing the ballot is Reform UK's Martin Houlden, who has a number of previous parliamentary campaigns under his belt (most recently as Reform UK candidate for Bournemouth East last year) but is standing at local council level for the first time.
