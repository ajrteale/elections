Five by-elections, for seven seats, on 2nd October 2025:

<h2>Harrietsham, Lenham and North Downs</h2>

Maidstone council, Kent; caused by the resignation of independent councillors Kathy Cox and Janetta and Tom Sams.

Today is the first edition of Andrew's Previews which is being sent out early to paying subscribers.  And as a treat for that we have an extremely rare event to bring you: a triple by-election.

For the location of this we are on the southern slopes of the North Downs, in a ward which many people pass through but where few stop - except on those occasions where Operation Stack is in effect.  All the main communication links from London to Folkestone - the Maidstone to Ashford railway line, High Speed 1, the M20 motorway and the A20 road which it relieved - pass through the valley of the River Len to the east of Maidstone.

The Rivers Len and Great Stour both rise near the village of Lenham, which lies on the original A20 road.  Lenham is technically a town because it has a market charter, and a farmer's market is held here monthly.  The A20 also passes through the larger village of Herrietsham to the west.  Harrietsham, Lenham and Hollingbourne are all stops within the ward for trains between Maidstone and Ashford.  To the north of the railway line, and within the Kent Downs National Landscape, can be found six smaller parishes on top of the escarpment: they are Hucking, Bicknor, Wormshill, Frinsted, Wichling and Otterden.

The M20 motorway past Harrietsham and Lenham has frequently appeared in road traffic reports over the years.  Ever since this stretch of motorway first opened in 1993 it has been the main focus of Operation Stack, under which Kent Police close the motorway when there is serious disruption with the Dover ferries or the Channel Tunnel: this allows the carriageway to be turned into a parking area for lorries waiting to cross the Channel until things get back to normal.  Operation Stack could last for days at a time, resulting in enormous traffic disruption in Harrietsham and Lenham.  In 2019 Stack was superseded by Operation Brock, under which a moveable barrier has been installed on this section of the M20 to allow one of the carriageways to be retained for local traffic (in the form of a contraflow) if lorries are queueing on the other carriageway.

And there could be more local traffic in future.  Maidstone council have big development plans here, which involve turning one corner of Lenham parish into a garden village called Heathlands with 5,000 homes and all the necessary school, service and employment provision including a new railway station.  If Heathlands gets off the ground it will be bigger than Harrietsham and Lenham put together: according to the notice of poll for this by-election Harrietsham parish has 2,683 electors, while the two polling stations at Lenham community centre serve 4,031 electors although not all of them are in Lenham parish.

We may be about to see just how politically toxic this plan is, because it has led to the resignation of all three Maidstone councillors for Harrietsham, Lenham and North Downs ward.  First to go were husband and wife Tom and Janetts Sams, who were very long-serving councillors.  Tom Sams was first elected for the former Harrietsham and Lenham ward in 1995 on the Labour ticket, with Janetta joining him in 2002.  Tom lost his seat to the Conservatives in 2006 but got it back as an independent in 2007 when Janetta stood down; he then resigned from the council in advance of the 2014 election, provoking an election for two seats which went to Janetta (this time as an independent) and to UKIP.  Tom got his seat back from UKIP in 2015 and the two Samses had had continuous service then.

Boundary changes for the 2024 Maidstone election merged Harrietsham and Lenham ward with the former North Downs ward and added a third councillor.  North Downs had been a safe Conservative ward prior to 2024, but it was comfortably outvoted by Harrietsham and Lenham and the combined ward went on to return three independents.  Topline figures here in 2024 were 58% for independent candidates and 17% for the Conservative slate, with the Samses running quite a long way ahead of the third independent candidate Kathy Cox.

Maidstone council is very balanced, with the 2024 election returning 13 Conservatives, 12 Lib Dems, 10 Greens, 8 independent and 6 Labour councillors; a previous Conservative minority administration has been replaced by a coalition of Lib Dem, Green and independent councillors, with the Green Party supplying the council leader.  Kathy Cox, who became Maidstone's cabinet member for corporate resources, is also uncomfortable with the Heathlands scheme and was not happy to continue on the council after the Samses had quit.  She subsequently handed in her notice to allow a single by-election to be held for all three seats.

Doing this saves time and money for everyone involved, but a triple by-election is still an extremely rare event.  Your columnist is only aware of two previous occasions of this happening this century: both of those were in July 2005, when the Aston and Bordesley Green wards of Birmingham went to the polls for all three seats after their 2004 elections were voided in the notorious "banana republic" Election Court case.   Which isn't the most promising of precedents.

Harrietsham, Lenham and North Downs ward is part of the Maidstone Rural East division of Kent county council, which was convincingly gained in May by Reform UK having previously voted Conservative.  At Westminster level it is covered by the Faversham and Mid Kent constituency, which has been in Conservative hands since its creation in 1997: since 2015 the local MP has been Helen Whately, who never rose above junior ministerial rank when the Conservatives were in government but is now in the shadow cabinet, shadowing the work and pensions portfolio.

These results from other levels of government may be important here in the UK's first triple by-election for 20 years, because only two independent candidates have come forward for the three vacated seats.  This means we will definitely have a change in council composition.  The two independents are Gary Butler, who has a long previous electoral history with a variety of far-right parties, and Sam Lawrence-Rose who is the head of adult social care and health at Kent county council but will not be helped by giving an address in Tonbridge and Malling district.  On the Conservative slate Onyekachuwku Chukwuma, who is the only candidate here from 2024 to return for another go, is joined by two students: Isobelle Horne is reading politics at the University of Leeds, while Darcy Rotherham was an unsuccessful candidate for the county council in May while also sitting her A-level exams at the same time.  Reform UK have selected three candidates with no previous electoral track record: Chris Houlihan is a parish councillor in Detling to the north of Maidstone, Mariela Nedelcheva is a nurse who came to the UK from her native Bulgaria in 2002, while Steve Povey has recently retired from a career in the telecoms industry.  The Liberal Democrat slate of Sam Burrows, Andrew Cockersole and Jennifer Horwood, the Green Party candidates Reshmi Lakam, James Snyder and Callum Sweetman, and the Heritage Party's Sean Turner complete a ballot paper of fifteen candidates chasing three seats.  This is an English local by-election, so electors here have three votes.

<h2>Lake North</h2>

Isle of Wight council; caused by the resignation of Reform UK councillor David Maclean.

We now go offshore for the this week's by-election defence by those new kids on the political block Reform UK.  After winning the May 2025 local elections the Faragists have continued their momentum into the local by-elections since May: after last week's result, Reform UK have won 38 of the 111 seats up for election, which is a net gain of 33 seats.  It's only 17 months since the party first won seats in an ordinary council election in their own right, and most Reform UK councillors haven't been around long enough to resign yet.  But there are some.

Which brings us offshore to the parish of Lake, which is on the south-east coast of the Isle of Wight overlooking Sandown Bay.  Lake lies in between the towns of Sandown (to the north) and Shanklin (to the south) and effectively merges into both of them.  It is the last stop on the Island Line railway before its southern terminus at Shanklin.  Lake railway station was opened by British Rail in 1987, which makes it younger than the trains eerving it: the Island Line has recently taken delivery of some new trains, which were originally built in 1978 for the District Line of the London Underground.

The Isle of Wight formed a single Parliamentary seat from 1885 - when the island's main town of Newport was disenfranchised by the Third Redistribution - to 2024, when it was split into two seats with very low electorates.  In last year's general election the Isle of Wight East constituency returned a brand-new Conservative MP in the form of Joe Robertson.  Robertson came to the Commons from local governemnt: he still sits on the Isle of Wight council, where he represents Bembridge, and he was leader of the Conservative group from 2021 to 2023.

In recent years Wight council has frequently alternted between Conservative and independent control, often with little reference to what might be going on on the English mainland.  We are currently in an independent-led phase after the 2021 Wight election returned a hung council: the Conservatives won 18 seats against 13 independents, 2 seats for the Green Party, 2 seats for the Island Independent Network and 1 each for Labour, the Lib Dems and localist parties Our Island and the Vectis Party.  The Vectis Party councillor was subsequently sent to prison for historic child sex offences, and his party are no longer represented on the council.  The Island Independent Network are one of a number of localist groups around the country who share a single "Independent Network" party registration with the Electoral Commission, and accordingly the Local Elections Archive Project lists their cndidates under the party name "Independent Network".

Lake North ward voted Labour in 2005 and 2013, but more recently it had been in the Conservative column.  The current ward boundaries were introduced in 2021, when the wonderfully-named Coservative councillor Tig Outlaw was re-elected with 44% of the vote, against 31% for the Island Independent Network candidate Adrian Whittaker and 15% for Labour.

The 2025 Isle of Wight council elections were cancelled pending local government reorganisation, which was a bizarre decision by central government: the only possible changes to the current state of the island's local government would either involve splitting it up - which would undo the change made when the present council was creatd in 1995 - or constructing a cross-Solent local authority which would be both unpopular and unworkable.  The latter opinion was clearly shared by Tig Outlaw, who has moved to the mainland but still commutes to Sandown, and he resigned from the council to allow a by-election to held on the originally-scheduled date of 1st May.

May's Lake North by-election was gained from the Conservatives by Reform UK candidate David Maclean, a semi-retired tobacco dealer who left his native Zimbabwe (or "Rhodesia", as he called it when interviewed by the local press) in 1986.  He polled 36% of the vote against 29% for Adrian Whittaker who now had the Conservative nomination, 12% for the Greens and 11% for the Lib Dems.  Maclean resigned from the council in August after just four months in office, after coming under criticism for not attending council meetings; Reform UK have blamed this on a recent family bereavement.

The winner of this by-election won't serve for much longer than that, because the delayed Isle of Wight council elections are due to go ahead in May 2026.  This time Reform UK have selected Bill Nigh, who is hoping to make it third time lucky after finishing second in two Wight council by-elections earlier this year (first in Freshwater South ward, then in Wroxall, Lowtherville and Bonchurch ward).  Also hoping to make it third time lucky is the Conservatives' Adrian Whittaker, the vice-chair of Lake parish council, who was runner-up here in 2021 for the Island Independent Network and then runner-up in May for the Conservatives.  The Green Party have selected Robert May, who contested Shanklin Central ward at the last two Wight local elections.  Standing for the Lib Dems is Bob Blezzard, a retired senior local government officer who was runner-up here in 2017 and is having another go after his fourth-place finish here in May.  Labour's Christopher Lloyd completes an all-male ballot paper for Lake North ward's second by-election of the year.

<h2>Hutton South</h2>

Brentwood council, Essex; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Mark Reed.

This month Andrew's Previews is going to be visiting a number of districts which haven't been covered in this column in some years, including ticking off the last two districts in Great Britain which have never had the full treatment from this column.  Today we visit Brentwood council for the first time in ten years, our last profile here being for Shenfield ward in October 2015..

At the time Shenfield railway station was am important junction on the Great Eastern main line, with frequent local stopping trains to Liverpool Street starting and terminating here.  Those trains have now been transferred to the Elizabeth Line and they now run through central London to Paddington and Heathrow Airport, leading to a large increase in the number of passengers commuting from Shenfield station.

The Brentwood suburb of Hutton lies to the east of the railway line, and Shenfield station can be found in the northern corner of Hutton South ward.  This ward includes most of the affluent enclave of Hutton Mount, and that has kept Hutton South safely in the Conservative column so far this century.  Since a 2009 by-election one of the ward councillors has been Roger Hirst, who has held the role of Essex police and crime commissioner since 2016 in addition to his Brentwood council duties.  The 2024 election here, fought on expanded boundaries with a large number of voters and an additional councillor transferred from Brentwood South ward, gave 45% to the Conservative slate, 28% to Labour and 16% to the Liberal Democrats.  However, this places the ward in the minority on Brentwood council, which is hung and run by a Lib Dem-Labour coalition.

This Tory dominance still extends to other levels of government.  The Brentwood and Ongar parliamentary seat safely re-elected its Conservative MP Alex Burghart last year; he is now in Kemi Badenoch's shadow cabinet, shadowing the dual roles of Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Northern Ireland because the Tories no longer have enough MPs to put a full shadow cabinet together.  Martin Bell, who finished second here as an independent candidate in 2001, still holds the record of being the closest a non-Conservative candidate has come to winning this seat.  The Tories also hold the two Essex county council divisions which cover this ward, Brentwood Hutton and Brentwood South; the 2025 Essex county elections were cancelled.

This by-election is to replace Conservative councillor Mark Reed, who suddenly died in July at the early age of 57.  Reed was a long-serving councillor who had continuous service here since winning a by-election in October 2008, and he was the Mayor of Brentwood in 2015-16.  He was elected in second place in 2024, so the winner of this by-election will take over the remainder of a three-year term ending in 2027.

Defending for the Conservatives is Thomas Bridge, who is hoping to get back on the council after losing his seat in 2024: Bridge previously represented Ingatestone, Fryerning and Mountnessing ward from 2016 to 2021 and then Tipps Cross ward from 2021 to 2024.  Labour have reselected Jonathan Saunders, a 24-year-old student at the University of London who fought this ward last year.  The Lib Dems' Brenner Munden is a former Brentwood councillor who won a 2023 by-election in South Weald ward, but lost his seat the following year as a result of boundary change.  Another all-male ballot paper is completed by David Hale for the Green Party and Russell Quirk, a former Conservative councillor for Hutton North ward (2011-15) and now a regular contributor to Talk TV, for Reform UK.

<h2>Strawberry</h2>

Cheshire West and Chester council; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Gareth Gould.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44GB53rnI3c

Nothing is real, and nothing is forever.  The strawberries of last summer are now but a memory.  The Strawberry Fields children's home in Liverpool of John Lennon's memory is no more: the house was demolished in the 1970s due to structural problems, and its site is now run by the Salvation Army as a tourist attraction.  On the other side of the Mersey, the strawberry fields of Ellesmere Port have suffered a different fate: they have been built on for housing, and the only reminder of the Strawberry Farm and Strawberry Cottages shown on old maps here are the arterial road of Strawberry Way West and Strawberry Way East, either side of the Strawberry Roundabout.  And the Strawberry ward, which lies in the south-west of Ellesmere Port's urban sprawl.

Ellesmere Port has a reputation as a working-class town dominated by the Vauxhall car factory, and while this does influence Strawberry ward's demographics and politics it should be stressed that this is a relatively better-off part of the town.  There is almost no social housing here, and Strawberry ward is ranked in the top 30 wards in England and Wales for owner-occupation at 90.6% of households.

Despite this the ward has historically voted strongly for the Labour Party, because this is Ellesmere Port and that's the local culture.  The local authority here is Cheshire West and Chester council, which has a Labour majority: the 2023 elections returned 39 Labour councillors against 23 Conservatives, 5 independents, 2 Greens and 1 Lib Dem, and Labour carrying eight of the nine Ellesmere Port wards was crucial to that majority.  The one that got away was Whitby Park, which voted Green: Strawberry was safely in the Labour column in 2023 with a 69-25 lead over the Conservatives.  Andrew's Previews needs to declare an interest here: one of the Labour councillors is Britain Elects' very own head honcho Ben Walker.

The town has had a Labour MP continuously since 1992: since 2015 the local represenative has been Justin Madders, who had previously served as the last leader of Ellesmere Port and Neston council before its abolition in 2009.  Boundary changes for the 2024 election mean that Madders' constituency is now Ellesmere Port and Bromborough, crossing the boundary between the counties of Cheshire and Merseyside.

Strawberry ward took on its current boundaries since 2019, and since then its councillor had been Gareth Gould who has now stood down on health grounds.  Defending the seat for Labour is Kris Fisher, who works for a firm which promotes Green energy technology: he is not to be confused with the Kris Fisher who was a former regular character in the Cheshire soap <em>Hollyoaks</em>.  The Conservatives have selected Nicholas Hebson, a retired teacher who represented the predcessor ward of Strawberry Fields on Ellesmere Port and Neston council from 2007 to 2009.   Also on the ballot are the Lib Dems' Lizzie Jewkes who is not to be confused with cheap jewellery from Argos, Paul Bowers for the Green Party who is a former councillor for Helsby ward, left-wing independent candidate Ray McHale, and Reform UK's Jason Moorcroft who was their parliamentary candidate for Runcorn and Helsby in 2024.
