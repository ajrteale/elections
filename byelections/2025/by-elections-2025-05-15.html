Four by-elections on 15th May 2025:

<h2>Whetstone</h2>

Barnet council, London; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Liron Velleman.

We'll start the week in the high ground of outer London.  Long since swallowed up into the urban sprawl of the Great Wen, Whetstone lies on the old Great North Road (here called the High Road) around eight miles north of Charing Cross: it's in between the High Barnet branch of the Northern Line and the East Coast Main Line, which are respectively the western and eastern boundaries of this ward.  The Northern line station at Totteridge and Whetstone (opened in 1872 and transferred to the Underground in 1940) and the mainline station at Oakleigh Park (opeend in 1873 for a housing development of that name) connect the ward to central London.

The Whetstone itself is a stone of some antquity which lies outside the Griffin pub on the High Road.  It's located diagonally opposite Barnet House, a 12-storey modernist office block which was built in 1966 as the head office of the battery manufacturers Ever Ready.  Barnet House subsequently served from 1986 to 2019 as the main office building for Barnet council, and it is now being converted into housing.

This is a middle-class area which is now part of a Labour-held council and constituency: it's covered by the Chipping Barnet parliamemtary seat, gained last year from the Conservatives by Labour MP Dan Tomlinson, while Labour have a majority on Barnet council.  But Whetstone would have voted strongly for Margaret Thatcher when she was the local MP back in the day.

Whetstone ward was created in 2022 from territory which was previously in Oakleigh ward or Totteridge ward, and both of these were safe Conservative areas.  Totteridge was the powerbase of controversial Conservative councillor Brian Coleman who represented Barnet and Camden on the London Assembly from 2000 to 2012; Coleman was subsequently thrown out of the Conservative party following an assault conviction, stood for re-election in 2014 as an independent candidate and polled 6%.  Before his fall from grace Coleman had assidously forged strong links with the area's Jewish and Greek Cypriot communities: Whetstone ward is 9.1% Jewish and has 1.75% of residents born in Cyprus or Malta, both of which rank among the top 40 wards in England and Wales.

So perhaps it helped that Labour nominated a slate of two Jewish candidates here for the inaugural Whetstone ward election in 2022.  Ella Rose and Liron Velleman, who defeated the Conservative slate by 51-36, were both heavily involved in the Jewish Labour Movement: Rose is its national vice-chair, while Velleman (who is the grandson of a Holocaust survivor) had been an organiser for the Jewish Labour Movement alongside his day job as head of politics for the Community union.

However, Velleman quit both the council and his job in April in rather mysterious circumstances, shortly after his party affiliation on Barnet council's website had changed from Labour to independent.  It's not clear whether he jumped from the party or was pushed, and despite mutterings at the time from the Conservative group that Velleman had been forced to resign "under a cloud of darkness" no further details appear to have come into the public domain at the time of writing.  The fact that "whetstone" is in the dictionary as a stone for sharpening knives might be merely a coincidence.

Defending this seat for Labour is Ezra Cohen who is fighting his first election campaign.  The Conservatives have reselected Tom Smith, who was a councillor for the predecessor Oakleigh ward from 2018 to 2022 and was runner-up here three years ago.  Last time the Greens were the only other party to stand in Whetstone ward, but this by-election has attracted a much larger field with Charli Thompson nominated for the Green Party, Luigi Bille for the Lib Dems, Richard Hewison for Rejoin EU, Martin Hudson for the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition, indepndent candidate Brian Ingram who will be hoping for an improvement on the 20 votes he polled in the last Barnet council by-election (in Finchley Church End ward in March), and Adrian Kitching for Reform UK.

<h2>Acle</h2>

Broadland council, Norfolk; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Lana Hempsall.

Our rural by-election today comes in the Norfolk Broads.  The market town of Acle lies on the main road and railway line between Norwich and Great Yarmouth, roughly halfway in between them.  It is the only crossing-point of the River Bure between Great Yarmouth and Wroxham, and the town lies at the western end of the Acle Straight - an arrow-straight road across the marshland which was built in 1831 and remains today the main road link to Great Yarmouth from the west.

In the 2021 census Acle ward, which has the same boundaries as Acle parish, made the top 100 wards in England and Wales for residents aged 85 or over (6.6%) and registered a large retired population.  Until recently this would have suggested a true-blue demographic, and this is borne out by Acle's previous election results.  The ward is part of the Broadland and Fakenham parliamentary seat which has been represented since 2019 by Conservative MP Jerome Mayhew, son of the former Northern Ireland secretary Patrick Mayhew: Mayhew junior is currently on the Tory frontbench as shadow transport minister.

The Acle ward of Boradland council and the larger Acle division of Norfolk county council have consistently returned the Conservative candidate over the last two decades, although the outgoing district councillor Lana Hempsall won by just one vote over an independent candidate when she was first elected to Broadland council in 2011.  Her majority in 2023 was only a little more comfortable, at 47-42 over Labour; the Conservatives lost control of Broadland council that year, and a Lib Dem-led traffic-light coalition is now in control.

Lana Hempsall has also been the Norfolk county councillor for Acle since 2021, and she has stood twice for Parliament as a Conservative candidate (contesting Denton and Reddish in 2015 and Norwich South in 2017).  She has held cabinet positions on both the county council and Broadland council, and she has recently drawn on her professional experience in the energy sector to co-found a think tank called "Conservatives in Energy".  Add all this to Hempsall's charitable work with Guide Dogs for the Blind (she is herself partially sighted), and one suspects that there simply weren't enough hours in the day to do everything: she has resigned her Broadland council seat but remains on the county council.  Norfolk is one of the counties which had their scheduled elections this year postponed, so Hempsall's county seat will be up for re-election next year.

Before then we have a district council by-election which is defended for the Conservatives by local resident Vincent Tapp: he is a former Broadland councillor, who represented Wroxham ward from 2015 to 2019 when he stood down.  Labour have reselected Emma Covington, who is a teacher, following her near-miss here in 2023.  Also standing are Philip Matthew for the Lib Dems, Peter Carter for the Greens and Jimmi Lee for Reform UK.

<h2>Birches Head and Northwood</h2>

Stoke-on-Trent council, Staffordshire; caused by the disqualification of Labour councillor Steve Blakemore.

We now travel to the Six Towns of the Potteries, which fused together in the kiln of local government reorganisation in 1910 to create the city of Stoke-on-Trent.  But Stoke itself is primarily the railhead and administrative centre of the Potteries: the commercial centre has always been Hanley, which was a county borough of its own before the Federation.

Birches Head and Northwood is one of the modern wards which cover Hanley: Northwood lies immediately to the east of the city centre, with the more isolated estate of Birches Head further out.  The ward also includes Central Forest Park, a large area of green space on the site of the former Hanley Deep Pit which was opened by Elizabeth II in 1973.  It is claimed to have Europe's largest "street style skate park", although one suspects that the late Queen might not have tried that out herself.

Central Forest Park was nameched on the Six Towns' ward map until 2023, when a boundary review renamed "Birches Head and Central Forest Park" to "Birches Head and Northwood" with minimal boundary changes.  Since the previous ward was drawn up in 2011 this area has been fought over in local elections between Labour and the City Independents group, who ran Stoke-on-Trent in coalition with the Conservatives from 2015 until the Tories dumped their coalition partners and started to rule alone in 2020.  The 2023 Stoke elections saw Labour gain overall control of the city with the City Independents reduced to one seat, and Birches Head and Northwood was part of the Labour majority: vote shares here two years ago were 44% for Labour, 32% for the City Independents and 20% for the Conservatives.  In the 2024 general election the Stoke-on-Trent Central constituency was a Labour gain from the Conservatives, with Gareth Snell recovering the seat which he had won in a 2017 by-election and lost in 2019; second place in the seat last year went to Reform UK.

The two Labour councillors elected here in 2023 were Steve Blakemore and Adrian Knapper.  Blakemore, who is associated with the Unite union, worked for a company called Unitas which was responsible for repairs and maintenance to Stoke's council house stock and public buildings.  Unitas was a wholly-owned subsidiary of the city council, but following changes in housing law the council cabinet decided last year that this service should be brought back in-house.  Accordingly Blakemore became a council employee, via the magic of TUPE, at the start of April.  This by-election is a direct consequence of that transfer of employemnt, because Blakemore's new status as a Stoke council employee disqualifies him from being a Stoke councillor.

Defending the resulting by-election for Labour is Maggie Bradley, who has previously served as a Stoke-on-Trent councillor from 1996 to 2002: she represented Stoke West ward from 1996 to 1999 and Hanley Green (the predecessor to this ward) from 1999 to 2002 under her former surname of McQuillan.  Another candidate with a long history here is the City Independents' Jean Bowers, who has served twice as Lord Mayor of Stoke: Bowers was first elected as a Liberal Democrat councillor for Hanley Green ward in 2000, she represented Northwood and Birches Head ward for that party from 2002 to 2011 and then served from 2015 to 2023 as a City Independents councillor for Birches Head and Central Forest Park.  The Conservatives have selected Khawar Ali, who had a poor outing at the last Stoke-on-Trent by-election in Meir North ward last May.  And completing the ballot paper is Reform UK's Luke Shenton, who finished as runner-up when he was the party's parlaimentary candidate for Stoke-on-Trent Central last year.
