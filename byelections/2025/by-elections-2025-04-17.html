Two by-elections on Maundy Thursday, 17th April 2025:

<h2>Colgate and Rusper</h2>

Horsham council, West Sussex; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Liz Kitchen.

Maundy Thursday used to be a <em>dies non</em> in electoral law; a day when elections could not be held, and which did not count as a working day for the purposes of the electoral timetable.  This rule was changed in 2006, but elections on Maundy Thursday are still rare: partly, this is because it falls only a few weeks before the ordinary local elections on the first Thursday in May, making it unattractive to call the electors out when they will be going to the polls shortly afterwards in the ordinary course of events.  We'll discuss this further in the second part of today's Preview.

The May 2025 local elections in England will be the quietest set for many years (with the exception of May 2020, which we do not talk about).  This is primarily the year of the cycle where the county councils come up for election, but this year only some of them are going to the polls because of forthcoming local government reorganisation.  West Sussex county council, which covers the villages of Colgate and Rusper, has had its 2025 elections postponed.  This means that an April by-election date here is more attractive to the local parties.

Which brings us to the Colgate and Rusper ward of Horsham district, which covers the rural area between Horsham and Crawley.  Despite the order of the names Rusper is the larger village: it's located in the Sussex countryside to the west of Crawley, roughly underneath the Gatwick Airport flightpath.  Colgate lies to the south-west of Crawley within St Leonard's Forest, and the Col of its name refers to charcoal burning in years gone by associated with the Wealden iron industry.  All that industry is long gone, and Colgate is now part of the High Weald National Landscape.  In between the two villages lies Faygate, which is on the main road and railway line between Horsham and Crawley: Faygate railway station has a limited service, and official statistics show that it is the least-used station in West Sussex.

Boundary changes for the 2019 election added the part of North Horsham parish lying north of the town's bypass: this is a generally rural and industrial area, with a claypit and brickworks in operation together with a business park.  Further development at the other end of the ward has given us Kilnwood Vale, a brand-new garden city-style development on the edge of Crawley which welcomed its first residents in 2016.  It's so new that the Royal Mail don't yet recognise it as a place: all houses in Kilnwood Vale officially have Faygate addresses.  Kilnwood Vale primary school, which opened in 2019, is now by far the largest polling station in Colgate and Rusper ward with 2,339 electors on the roll - that's around 44% of the ward's electorate.  The Local Government Boundary Commission saw this development coming, and they deliberately drew up Colgate and Rusper ward in 2019 with a low electorate to allow room for the expected population growth.  The presence of Kilnwood Vale will account for Colgate and Rusper appearing in the top 100 wards in England and Wales for households in shared ownership (5.3%).

When Andrew's Previews previously talked about Colgate and Rusper, Kilnwood Vale was just a town planner's dream.  We were last in this corner of Sussex in October 2013 for a county council by-election to what was then Warnham and Rusper division, which was won easily by the Conservative candidate Liz Kitchen.  She was already a veteran of local government, having been first elected to Horsham council all the way back in 1987.  Kitchen served as leader of Horsham council for eight years, from 2001 to 2009, and she was also a county councillor from that 2013 by-election until she stood down in 2021.

The Conservatives are now in opposition on Horsham council where the Lib Dems have a majority, but Kitchen was still returned for her final term of office safely enough in 2023.  Shares of the vote on that occasion were 43% for the Conservatives, 31% for the Liberal Democrats and 14% for Labour, with Liz Kitchen beating her Conservative running-mate who was higher up the ballot paper: that's usually a sign of a decent personal vote.  Most of the ward is part of the St Leonard's Forest county division, which Kitchen represented from 2017 to 2021 and which remains safely in the Conservative column.

However, Colgate and Rusper now have a Liberal Democrat MP, after John Milne defeated the Conservative MP Sir Jeremy Quin in 2024 to become the first non-Conservative MP for Horsham since 1880.  Milne had previously sat on both the county and district councils.  He resigned his Horsham council seat later in 2024, resulting in a by-election in Denne ward last November which the Liberal Democrats lost to the Conservatives (<em>Andrew's Previews 2024</em>, forthcoming).  It appears that Milne had intended to see out his county council term, which was due to end in May 2025; however, following the postponment of the 2025 West Sussex county council elections, Milne has now tendered his resignation.  We will be back to this area in May for a county council by-election in Horsham Riverside division.

Before then the Conservatives having the task of defending the district council by-election following Liz Kitchen's passing in February.  Defending this seat for the Tories is Josh Bounds, whose previous electoral contests have come over the district boundary in Crawley New Town: Bounds, who lives in Kilnwood Vale, was a Crawley councillor for the neighbouring Ifield ward from 2021 until he stood down in 2024.  The Lib Dem candidate is Hannah Butler, who chairs the residents association for Kilnwood Vale.  Labour have selected Gerard Kavanagh, who lives in Horsham town and contested the town's Forest ward in 2023.  Also standing are Andrew Finnegan for the Greens and Robert Nye for Reform UK.

<h2>Appledore</h2>

Torridge council, Devon; caused by the disqualification of independent councillor Leonard Ford.

Andrew's Previews' first post of the year concerned Instow, a village on the east bank of the Torridge estuary in north Devon.  Today we're going to the other bank of that estuary to consider the village of Appledore.  This is a busy place in the tourist season with its shops, caf√©s and galleries; but Appledore has a year-round source of income as a shipbuilding centre.  The Appledore shipyard has took on a lot of work for the Royal Navy and the Irish Naval Service in recent years, and the bow sections of the aircraft carriers HMS <em>Queen Elizabeth</em> and HMS <em>Prince of Wales</em> were built here.  Appledore Shipbuilders also built one of the three remaining Royal Mail Ships, the RMV <em>Scillonian III</em> which links the Isles of Scilly to Cornwall.  In 2020 the yard was bought by Harland and Wolff.
