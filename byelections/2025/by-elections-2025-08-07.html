<h2>Easington and Shotton</h2>

Durham council; caused by the resignation of Reform UK councillor John Bailey.

We'll finish for the week in County Durham with a trip to one of the UK's more obscure constituency names.  The village of Easington only has 2,175 electors on the roll according to the notice of poll, but it as a long history: the church of St Mary the Virgin goes back to the 12th or 13th centuries with fragments of stonework from the 8th century, and for centuries the vicar of Easington also had the important title of Archdeacon of Durham.  The archdeacon's residence was Seaton Holme, a 13th-century hall which served as the rectory until 1960 and is now operated as a "discovery centre".  It's a polling station for today's by-election.

From 1899 Easington village was eclipsed by the sinking of Easington Colliery to the east, which quickly spawned its own village.  The pit operated until 1993, when it closed with the loss of 1,400 jobs.  Shortly afterwards the village of Easington Colliery hit the silver screen as the main filming location for the 2000 film <em>Billy Elliot</em>, which was set in the thinly-disguised County Durham village of "Everington".  The film was nominated for three Academy Awards and won three BAFTAs, and it launched the film career of Jamie Bell who, then aged 13, became the youngest-ever winner of the BAFTA for Best Actor.

This isn't the only "youngest" record associated with Easington Colliery.  In 1925 this village was the birthplace of Dennis Donnini, whose father had come from Italy to open an ice-cream parlour in the village.  In 1944 Donnini enlisted for war service in the Royal Scots Fusiliers, and the following January he was killed in action at Selfkant, on what is now the western border of Germany, in circumstances which led to his being awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross.  Donnini was aged 19 years and 2 months at the time of his death, and he was the youngest Second World War soldier to receive the VC.

In 1950 Easington joined the Parliamentary map with the creation of the Easington constituency, which has been in existence ever since then.  Had this seat been created a couple of decades later, it might well have had a different name thanks to the development of the New Town of Peterlee nearby.  Some of Peterlee's outlying western industrial estates are within this ward in the parish of Shotton Colliery, whose pit closed in 1972.  The pithead site here has since been redeveloped as an airfield, which is primarily used for skydiving.

Shotton Colliery was developed by the Haswell Coal Company, who subsequently closed the pit at Haswell as early as 1896; this led to the village's population collapsing as Haswell became a rural settlement again.  In 1937 this village was the birthplace of the ill-fated cyclist Tom Simpson, who went on to win the world road race championship and the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award in 1965 before dying on the climb of Mont Ventoux in 1967.

The fifth parish in this ward is Shadforth.  Unusually for this area Shadforth village never had a colliery of its own, but the parish also includes the pit villages of Ludworth and Sherburn Hill; and mining is still a major part of the parish's economy thanks to the presence of the quarry and concrete plant at Crime Rigg which is very much still in operation.  Despite this Crime Rigg quarry is a Site of Special Scientific Interest, because the quarry workings have exposed some interesting Permian geology.  Shadforth parish also exports energy thanks to the presence of the small Hare Hill windfarm, whose two turbines have a generating capacity of up to 5.5 megawatts.

As stated, Easington has been a parliamentary seat since 1950.  Its first MP was Manny Shinwell, who was a frontbencher in the two Ramsay Macdonald governments but later defeated Macdonald to become MP for the predecessor seat of Seaham in 1935.  Shinwell served in Cabinet throughout the Attlee administration, and in 1946 as Minister of Fuel and Power he pushed through the nationalisation of UK coalmining - his constituency's major employer at the time.  Shinwell was War Secretary when he became Easington's first MP at the 1950 general election, and he served throughout Attlee's short-lived second administration as Defence Secretary.  He was the oldest MP in the 1964 and 1966 Parliaments and was 85 when ho retired to the Lords in 1970; Lord Shinwell was still active in the Lords until shortly before his death in 1986, at the age of 101.

In Shinwell's day the Labour vote in Easington was not counted but weighed.  His modern-day successor Grahame Morris still has a safe Labour seat, but the party's 80% vote shares of days gone past are a memory now.  The beneficiary of this in recent years has been the radical right: Easington had the sixth-highest vote for the Brexit Party in December 2019, and their successors Reform UK finished second here in the 2024 general election with almost 30% of the vote, to Labour's 49%.

It took longer for Labour's local election vote in Easington to collapse, and even when Labour lost control of Durham council in 2021 three of the predecessors to the modern Easington and Shotton ward returned a full slate of Labour councillors: the exception, Shotton and South Hetton, voted for independent candidates.  So it must have been a nasty shock for Durham Labour when Reform UK swept to victory in the newly-drawn ward in May 2025 as part of their takeover of the county: topline figures in Easington and Shotton three months ago were 50% for the Reform UK slate, 22% for independent candidates (with four independents standing for the three available seats) and just 19% for Labour.

Since then Reform UK have had to defend three by-elections (including one elsewhere in County Durham) and lost them all, so we are still waiting for the party's first local by-election hold.  It has to be said that Easington and Shotton is much more promising for the party on paper than the previous three losses.

Reform UK are seeking to replace John Bailey, who topped the poll here in May but stood down a month later on health grounds.  Bailey had previously served as a Durham councillor from 2008 to 2013, being elected for the Liberal Democrats in Crook North and Tow Law division but losing re-election in 2013 as a Wear Valley Independent Group candidate, and he was a Lib Dem member of Wear Valley council when it was abolished in 2009.

We have a lot of interest in this by-election with eight candidates standing.  The defending Reform UK candidate is Louise Penders, who is fighting her first election campaign and gives an address in Easington Colliery.  Three incumbent Durham councillors lost re-election here in May and all three of them want their seats back, led by independent candidate Chris Hood who gives an address in Haswell and previously represented Shotton and South Hetton ward.  He was placed fifth here in May just ahead of Labour candidate Angela Surtees, who beat her running-mates higher up the alphabet in what is normally a good sign of a personal vote: Surtees previously represented Easington ward from 2013 to 2025 and she is still an Easington Colliery parish councillor.  They were both some way ahead of independent Ivan Cochrane, a funeral director who had previously represented Shotton and South Hetton ward from 2017 to 2025.  A third independent standing in this by-election is Easington Village parish councillor Arlene Childs, who runs a number of holiday lets in the area; in May Childs contested Horden and Dene House ward and polled poorly.  Completing the ballot paper are Tony Stubbs for the Conservatives, Chukwuka Okochukwu for the Lib Dems and Stephen Ashfield for the Green Party.
