Three by-elections on 7th August 2025:
</p><p>
<h2>Llangennech</h2>
</p><p>
<em>Carmarthenshire council, West Wales; caused by the death of Labour councillor Gary Jones.</em>
</p><p>
This week is going to be a Coalfield Special, as Andrew's Previews covers three parts of England and Wales which owe their history to the presence of carbon in the underlying rocks.  Of the seats up for election today, one is defended by Reform UK and the other two by the party which has traditionally been associated with this sort of area: the Labour Party.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/carms-llangennech-2025.webp" alt="Carms, Llangennech" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
We'll start with a Labour defence in South Wales.  The village of Llangennech lies east of Llanelli, on the western side of the Loughor estuary; it is bypassed by the A4138, the main road link from Llanelli to the M4 motorway, and it has a little-used railway station on the Heart of Wales line.  Llangennech was once the site of several collieries, and it also served a military function as the location of a large Royal Navy stores depot.  All this is gone now, but other industries have sprung up to fill the gap and Llangennech's good road links have also turned it into something of a commuter centre.  It might be indicative that the ONS have included Llangennech within the Travel to Work Area for Swansea rather than nearby Llanelli.
</p><p>
Despite this Llangennech is part of the Westminster and Senedd constituencies based on Llanelli, which are both held by the Labour Party.  Dame Nia Griffith, a junior frontbencher with responsibilities for Wales and equalities, has been the local MP since 2005; but she was re-elected fairly narrowly for her sixth term in 2024 against competition from Reform UK and Plaid Cymru.
</p><p>
The current Labour MS for Llanelli, Lee Waters, was re-elected here in 2021 for his second term by a much more comfortable margin over Plaid Cymru.  However, Plaid have often been competitive here in Senedd elections, and they did win Llanelli in 1999 and 2007.  The Welsh nationalists are also likely to be in top in the Sir Gaerfyrddin constituency which will return six MSs for Carmarthenshire in the next Senedd.  If we add together the votes cast last year in the Llanelli and Carmarthen constituencies, then proportional representation would give two seats each to Plaid Cymru and Labour and one each to Reform UK and the Conservatives.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2022/carms22s.svgz" alt="Carms, 2022" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
The forthcoming Sir Gaerfyrddin constituency will helpfully have the same boundaries as Carmarthenshire county council, which returned a bare majority of Plaid Cymru councillors in 2022: Plaid won 38 seats against 23 for Labour and 14 independents.  A defection loss has since tipped the ruling Plaid group into a minority with 37 seats, while Reform UK took a by-election off Labour in Llanelli town in May this year.
</p><p>
Before the establishment of the modern Carmarthenshire county council in 1996, Llangennech returned one member of Dyfed county council.  Between 1977 and 1989 that councillor was Plaid Cymru's Hywel Teifi Edwards, who is notable enough for Wikipedia.  As well as his Welsh nationalism, Edwards was an academic who rose to become head of the Welsh Language department at University College of Swansea; he also wrote a number of books on historical subjects ranging from the Bryn Seion Presbyterian chapel in Llangennech to the history of the National Eisteddfod of Wales.  He died in 2010 and so he did not live to see the disgrace of his son, the former BBC newsreader Huw Edwards.
</p><p>
Plaid Cymru continued to have the upper hand in Llangennech's local elections into the early years of the 21st century, and it's only in the last decade that Labour have broken through here.  The ward's first Labour councillor this century was Gary Jones, who gained one of Llangennech's two seats in 2017; in 2022 Labour won the second seat, as the Labour slate defeated Plaid Cymru by 62-38 in a straight fight.  On the same day the elections to Llangennech community council, which has the same boundaries as this ward, returned seven Labour and five Plaid Cymru councillors.
</p><p>
This by-election is to replace Gary Jones, who died in May from pancreatic cancer.  Jones was a former chairman of Llangennech community council, and away from politics he had worked for many years at the Trostre steelworks in Llanelli and before then at the steelworks in his native Ebbw Vale.  He was also described as a rugby fan, an avid and informed reader, and a collector of military paraphernalia.
</p><p>
Defending this seat for Labour is Jordan Sargent, who was the only unsuccessful Labour candidate in the 2022 Llangennech community council election; this is his first time standing for the county council.  Another losing candidate in that community council election was Plaid Cymru's Richard Talog Jones, a bee farmer and military veteran who has done tours of Bosnia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Afghanistan and Iraq.  Also standing on an all-male ballot paper are Carmelo Colasanto for Reform UK, regular Carmarthenshire local by-election candidate Wayne Erasmus for the Welsh independence party Gwlad, Edward Evans for the Conservatives and Justin Griffiths for the Lib Dems.

<h2>Hednesford Green Heath</h2>
</p><p>
<em>Cannock Chase council, Staffordshire; caused by the death of Labour councillor Fred Prestwood.</em>
</p><p>
We now cross the border into England to come to a large ex-coalmining town on the Cannock Chase.  Hednesford (pronounced Hedgford if you're an old local, Hensford otherwise) is a town just to the north of Cannock, effectively filling in the gap between Cannock town and the wooded Cannock Chase National Landscape.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/cannock-chase-hednesford-grn-heath-2025.webp" alt="Cannock Chase, Hednesford Grn Heath" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
A small part of that National Landscape is within Hednesford Green Heath ward, whose census return suggests that this area has transitioned well to a post-coal economy: Green Heath ward has high levels of full-time employment.  It probably helps that Hednesford railway station, on the ward's eastern boundary, has frequent trains to Walsall and Birmingham to the south: the station lies on the Chase Line, which was electrified between Walsall and Rugeley in 2018.
</p><p>
Green Heath ward runs north-west from the railway station to take in the area around Pye Green Road, much of which was developed by the National Coal Board.  It has almost the same boundaries as the Pye Green ward of Hednesford town council.  Just to confuse matters, this parish ward has no overlap with the new Hednesford Pye Green ward of Cannock Chase council; the part of Hednesford parish within that ward is instead covered by West Hill parish ward.  This bizarre state of affairs will persist until the next Hednesford town council election in 2027, at which point the parish will get a new ward map and Pye Green parish ward will move from the west to the north of the town.
</p><p>
This column previously looked at Hednesford Green Heath ward for a by-election in September 2017, which resulted in a Labour gain from the Conservatives.  Much has changed here politically since then.  This ward is part of the Cannock Chase parliamentary seat, which has voted for the government at all eight general elections since its creation in 1997.  However, it took a strong split in the right-wing vote for Labour to gain this seat in July 2024, as Josh Newbury won with 36% of the vote against 29% for the outgoing Conservative MP Amanda Milling (who had polled 68% here in 2019) and 27% for Reform UK.
</p><p>
Newbury came to the Commons from an NHS career and from Cannock Chase council, where he had represented Norton Canes ward.  He left the council earlier this year and the resulting by-election was held on the same day as the Staffordshire county council elections, in which Reform UK took over the county with a large majority.  Hednesford North division, which includes Green Heath ward, gave 56% to the Reform UK candidate with the Greens best of the rest on 21%.
</p><p>
The Norton Canes district by-election in May didn't have a Reform UK candidate, which resulted in a massive swing to the Conservatives who defeated the Labour candidate by 1,256 votes to 469 in a straight fight.  A further 242 ballot papers, representing 12% of the votes cast, were rejected: 228 of these were blank, while the other 14 papers had votes for more than one candidate.  The vast majority of these spoiled votes were presumably cast by electors who had voted for Reform UK in the county elections but who didn't have that option in the district by-election.  The <a href="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk">Local Elections Archive Project</a> doesn't systematically collect data for spoiled votes, but for a ward of this size a total of 242 rejected votes is almost unheard of; a normal figure would be more like 10.
</p><p>
So the May 2024 Cannock Chase council election, in which all the councillors were up on new ward boundaries, is already looking rather out of date.  This returned a Labour majority with 21 Labour councillors against 10 Conservatives and 5 Greens, allowing Labour to dump the Green group which they had previously run the council in coalition with.  The boundary changes left Hednesford Green Heath ward almost untouched but increased its representation from two councillors to three to reflect strong population growth here: this key marginal ward voted 41% for the Labour slate, 25% for the Conservative slate and 20% for the Reform UK candidate.  Election results here on the old boundaries have several references to the Chase Independent Party, which is nothing to do with the ITV quiz show <em>The Chase</em>; this was the now-defunct political vehicle of Ron Turville, who was previously Green Heath ward's only Liberal Democrat councillor from 2003 to 2007 and is now deputy chair of Hednesford town council.
</p><p>
Labour now have to defend a seat here following the death of councillor Fred Prestwood at the age of 67.  He passed away in May, just before his year as vice-chair of the council was about to end.  Prestwood was a former miner, newsagent and postman who had first been elected to Cannock Chase council in 2023 from Cannock East ward, before transferring here in the boundary changes the following year.  He was elected here in second place in 2024, so the winner of this by-election will take over the rest of a three-year term ending in 2027.
</p><p>
Defending this seat for Labour is Alan Pearson, who is the chair of Hednesford town council and is seeking to return to Cannock Chase council: Pearson previously represented Hednesford North ward from 2012 to 2021, then Cannock South ward from 2022 to 2024, and he lost re-election last year in Cannock Longford and Bridgtown ward.  The Conservatives' Phil Hewitt previously featured in this column in September 2017 when he failed to defend a by-election in Hednesford South ward; Hewitt has since served as a Cannock Chase councillor for Hawks Green ward from 2018 to 2022 and as a Staffordshire county councillor for Hednesford and Rawnsley from 2017 to 2025.  Reform UK have selected Staffordshire county councillor and Hednesford town councillor Paul Jones, who was a Conservative councillor for this ward from 2022 until he lost his seat in 2024; Jones was subsequently elected in May 2025 as the Reform UK county councillor for Hednesford North, and he now wants his Cannock Chase council seat back under his new political colours.  Also on the ballot are Rachel Rock for the Greens, former Hednesford town councillor Sharon Jagger as an independent candidate, Terry Dryhurst for UKIP and Gareth Knox for the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition.

<h2>Easington and Shotton</h2>
</p><p>
<em>Durham council; caused by the resignation of Reform UK councillor John Bailey.</em>
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/durham-easington-shotton-2025.webp" alt="Durham, Easington/Shotton" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
We'll finish for the week in County Durham with a trip to one of the UK's more obscure constituency names.  The village of Easington only has 2,175 electors on the roll according to the notice of poll for this by-election, but it as a long history: the church of St Mary the Virgin goes back to the 12th or 13th centuries with fragments of stonework from the 8th century, and for centuries the vicar of Easington also had the important title of Archdeacon of Durham.  The archdeacon's residence was Seaton Holme, a 13th-century hall which served as the rectory until 1960 and is now operated as a "discovery centre".  It's a polling station for today's by-election.
</p><p>
From 1899 Easington village was eclipsed by the sinking of Easington Colliery to the east, which quickly spawned its own village.  The pit operated until 1993, when it closed with the loss of 1,400 jobs.  Its now-capped shaft is covered by this memorial in the form of a pit cage, which overlooks the North Sea.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/easington-colliery-pit-cage.webp" alt="Easington Colliery Pit Cage Memorial" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Shortly after the mine closed, the village of Easington Colliery hit the silver screen as the main filming location for the 2000 film <em>Billy Elliot</em>, which was set in the thinly-disguised County Durham village of "Everington".  The film was nominated for three Academy Awards and won three BAFTAs, and it launched the film career of Jamie Bell who, then aged 13, became the youngest-ever winner of the BAFTA for Best Actor.
</p><p>
This isn't the only "youngest" record associated with Easington Colliery.  In 1925 this village was the birthplace of Dennis Donnini, whose father had come from Italy to open an ice-cream parlour in the village.  In 1944 Donnini enlisted for war service in the Royal Scots Fusiliers, and the following January he was killed in action at Selfkant, on what is now the western border of Germany, in circumstances which led to his being awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross.  Donnini was aged 19 years and 2 months at the time of his death, and he was the youngest Second World War soldier to receive the VC.
</p><p>
In 1950 Easington Colliery and Easington Village joined the Parliamentary map with the creation of the Easington constituency, which has been in existence ever since then.  Had this seat been created a couple of decades later, it might well have had a different name thanks to the development of the New Town of Peterlee nearby.  Some of Peterlee's outlying western industrial estates are within this ward in the parish of Shotton Colliery, whose pit closed in 1972.  The pithead site here has since been redeveloped as an airfield, which is primarily used for skydiving.
</p><p>
Shotton Colliery was developed by the Haswell Coal Company, who subsequently closed the pit at Haswell as early as 1896; this led to the village's population collapsing as Haswell became a rural settlement again.  In 1937 this village was the birthplace of the ill-fated cyclist Tom Simpson, who went on to win the world road race championship and the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award in 1965 before dying on the climb of Mont Ventoux in 1967.
</p><p>
The fifth of the five parishes in this ward is Shadforth.  Unusually for this area Shadforth village never had a colliery of its own, but the parish also includes the pit villages of Ludworth and Sherburn Hill; and mining is still a major part of the local economy thanks to the presence of the quarry and concrete plant at Crime Rigg which is very much still in operation.  Despite this Crime Rigg quarry is a Site of Special Scientific Interest, because the quarry workings have exposed some interesting Permian geology.  Shadforth parish now exports energy not in the form of coal but thanks to the presence of the small Hare Hill windfarm, whose two turbines have a total generating capacity of up to 5.5 megawatts.
</p><p>
As stated, Easington has been a parliamentary seat since 1950.  Its first MP was Manny Shinwell, who was a frontbencher in the two Ramsay Macdonald governments but later defeated Macdonald to become MP for the predecessor seat of Seaham in 1935.  Shinwell served in Cabinet throughout the Attlee administration, and in 1946 as Minister of Fuel and Power he pushed through the nationalisation of UK coalmining - his constituency's major employer at the time.  Shinwell was War Secretary when he became Easington's first MP at the 1950 general election, and he served throughout Attlee's short-lived second administration as Defence Secretary.  He was the oldest MP in the 1964 and 1966 Parliaments and was 85 when he retired to the Lords in 1970; Lord Shinwell was still active in the Lords until shortly before his death in 1986, at the age of 101.
</p><p>
In Shinwell's day the Labour vote in Easington was not counted but weighed.  His modern-day successor Grahame Morris still has a safe Labour seat, but the party's 80% vote shares of days gone past are a memory now.  The beneficiary of this in recent years has been the radical right: Easington had the sixth-highest vote for the Brexit Party in December 2019, and their successors Reform UK finished second here in the 2024 general election with almost 30% of the vote, to Labour's 49%.
</p><p>
It took longer for Labour's local election vote in Easington to collapse, and even when Labour lost control of Durham council in 2021 three of the predecessors to the modern Easington and Shotton ward returned a full slate of Labour councillors: the exception, Shotton and South Hetton, voted for independent candidates.  So it must have been a nasty shock for Durham Labour when Reform UK swept to victory in the newly-drawn ward in May 2025 as part of their takeover of the county: topline figures in Easington and Shotton three months ago were 50% for the Reform UK slate, 22% for independent candidates (with four independents standing for the three available seats) and just 19% for Labour.
</p><p>
Since then Reform UK have had to defend three by-elections (including one elsewhere in County Durham) and lost them all, so we are still waiting for the party's first local by-election hold.  It has to be said that Easington and Shotton is much more promising for the party on paper than the previous three losses.
</p><p>
Reform UK are seeking to replace John Bailey, who topped the poll here in May but stood down a month later on health grounds.  Bailey had previously served as a Durham councillor from 2008 to 2013, being elected for the Liberal Democrats in Crook North and Tow Law division but losing re-election in 2013 as a Wear Valley Independent Group candidate, and he was a Lib Dem member of Wear Valley council when it was abolished in 2009.
</p><p>
We have a lot of interest in this by-election with eight candidates standing.  The defending Reform UK candidate is Louise Penders, who is fighting her first election campaign and gives an address in Easington Colliery.  Three incumbent Durham councillors lost re-election here in May and all three of them want their seats back, led by independent candidate Chris Hood who gives an address in Haswell and previously represented Shotton and South Hetton ward.  He was placed fifth here in May just ahead of Labour candidate Angela Surtees, who beat her running-mates higher up the alphabet in what is normally a good sign of a personal vote: Surtees previously represented Easington ward from 2013 to 2025 and she is still an Easington Colliery parish councillor.  They were both some way ahead of independent Ivan Cochrane, a funeral director who had previously represented Shotton and South Hetton ward from 2017 to 2025.  A third independent standing in this by-election is Easington Village parish councillor Arlene Childs, who runs a number of holiday lets in the area; in May Childs contested Horden and Dene House ward and polled poorly.  Completing the ballot paper are Tony Stubbs for the Conservatives, Chukwuka Okochukwu for the Lib Dems and Stephen Ashfield for the Green Party.
