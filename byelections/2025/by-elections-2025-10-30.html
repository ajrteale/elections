Six by-elections on 30th October 2025:
</p><p>
<h2>Garlinge</h2>
</p><p>
<em>Thanet council, Kent; caused by the resignation of Thanet Independents councillor John Worrow.</em>
</p><p>
Today's six by-elections are a politically diverse set, with the Conservatives defending two seats and the other six split between Labour, the Lib Dems, Reform UK and a free-for-all.  With which we start.
</p><p>
The name of Garlinge ward comes from an old farm in the area, Garling's Farm.  This area started to be deveoped in the 19th century when the railway came to the Thanet coast and Margate started to develop as a seaside resort.  Garlinge was incorporated into Margate in 1935.  The ward's main historical feature is the Dent-de-Lion Gateway, a 15th-century building which was originally the gatehouse to a now-lost castle.  One proposed future feature of Garlinge ward is a travellers' site, which is locally controversial.
</p><p>
The local authority here is Thanet council, which in 2015 was the only local authority ever to return a majority of UKIP councillors.  This experience did not go well, and less than three years later the UKIP had split so comprehensively that the Conservtives took over the council leadership.  But some ex-UKIP councillors from that era are still going as part of the Thanet Independents, the main remnant of the council's old UKIP group.
</p><p>
One of them is John Dennis, who has sat since 2015 as a councillor for Garlinge ward: he was originally elected on the UKIP ticket before being re-elected as a Thanet Independents candidate in 2019 and 2023.  The Thanet Independents' main competition in this ward has been from the Conservatives, who continued to hold one of Garlinge's two council seats up until two years ago.  Shares of the vote here in 2023 were 49% for the Thanet Independentss, 21% for the Conservatives and 20% for Labour, a result which puts Garlinge in the minority on the Labour-controlled council.
</p><p>
UKIP's spiritual successors these days are Reform UK, who carried all of Thanet's county divisions in May's local elections on the way to taking overall control of Kent county council.  The Birchington and Rural division, which includes Garlinge ward, returned the Reform UK slate of Luke Evans and Amelia Randall; in the five months since then Randall has walked out of the party to join UKIP.  She hasn't been the only Kent county councillor to leave the UKIP group, whether voluntarily or otherwise; but RUK's Kent branch have some way to go yet to match the splits of the 2015-18 Thanet UKIP administration.
</p><p>
The Conservatives do still hold this ward at Parliamentary level.  Garlinge is part of the Herne Bay and Sandwich constituency which has been represented since 1983 by Sir Roger Gale.  Gale is the oldest present member of the Commons at the age of 82; before entering politics he had worked in broadcasting, starting his career on the high seas as a pirate DJ with Caroline North for a few months in 1964-65.
</p><p>
Against this backdrop we have a by-election for an open seat on Thanet council, because the Thanet Independents party has recently dissolved itself: two of the three councillors elected on that ticket on 2023 are now listed as independents, while John Worrow has decided to hand in his notice due to commitments outside the district.  Worrow had sat for this ward since 2023 as a Thanet Independent and he previously served as a Conservative Thanet councillor from 2011 to 2015, then representing Birchington South ward.  Thanet council's monitoring officer may well be glad to see the back of Worrow, who had a stormy relationship with the council's ruling Labour administration and ended up being reported to the standards committee on multiple occasions.  On one occasion, following a row over compulsory equalities training, Worrow actually reported himself to the monitoring officer on the grounds that it would save time.
</p><p>
As stated there is no defending Thanet Independents candidate in this by-election.  The continuity candidate would appear to be Ian Driver, who was the Thanet Independents candidate in a by-election for the neighbouring Thanet Villages ward in May.  Driver he has previously served as a Labour councillor in Southwark (Brunswick ward, 1990-98) and as a Labour and then Green Party councillor in Thanet (Northwood ward, 2011-15),and he was the Green candidate for South Thanet at the 2015 general election.  He has managed to get the misspelled ballot paper description "Independant - Community First" past the returning officer despite this not being a registered description of any political party.  There is a party on the register with the name Community First, and the excellent website whocanivotefor.co.uk have listed Driver as that party's caniddate, but this seems unlikely because that Community First group is a localist party for Whitworth, a town in faraway Lancashire.  The Conservatives have selected Kerry Boyd, who was previously elected as a councillor for this ward in 2019 but lost her seat in 2023: she wants it back.  Labour's Bryan Harrod, who is a former postman, also has previous local government experience: he sat on Sevenoaks council for seventen years until losing his seat to the Conservatives in 2011.  Also on the ballot are Deb Shotton for the Green Party, Matthew Brown for the Liberal Democrats and Reform UK's Darren Oxborrow, who is fighting his first election campaign.

<h2>St John's</h2>
</p><p>
Tunbridge Wells council, Kent; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Matthew Fox.
</p><p>
We now come to a very different area of Kent: the spa town of Tunbridge Wells.  St John's ward lies in the north of the town around St John's primary school and to the east of St John's Road, which here is the A26 towards Sevenoaks and London.  All of these clearly derive their name from St John's church, which was built on the main road in the late 1850s; however, the church in fact lies just outside the ward boundary.  The ward's most prominent feature is the Skinners' School, a boys' grammar school founded here in 1887 by the Worshipful Company of Skinners; this school educated one present MP, the East Worthing and Shoreham Labour representative Tom Rutland.
</p><p>
Tunbridge Wells has been ground zero for the Conservative collapse in recent years, as the town's middle-class electorate - and St John's ward is no exception to that pattern - have recoiled in disgust from what the Conservative party has become and instead filled in their ballot papers for the Liberal Democrat candidates.  Probably in green ink.  The Lib Dems took overall control of Tunbridge Wells council at all-out elections in May 2024, after two years of leading a coalition administration, and two months later Mike Martin became the first Lib Dem MP for Tunbridge Wells since the modern seat was created in 1974.  Martin is a former Army officer who served in Afghanistan and dealt directly with the Taliban; he resigned his commission in 2014 so that he could publish his PhD thesis on the history of the Helmand conflict.
</p><p>
Unlike Afghanistan, we have a democracy in this country and political disputes here are settled with ballots rather than arms.  St John's ward was often closely fought between the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats until 2015, but since then the Conservative vote here has collapsed and the Lib Dems are now on a long winning streak.  All-out elections here in 2024 gave 49% to the Liberal Democrat slate, 26% to Labour and just 13% to the Conservatives.
</p><p>
The two councillors elected here in 2024 were Peter Lidstone and Matthew Fox.  Both of them have since resigned from the council.  Lidstone stood down in March to spend more time with his family, and the resulting by-election in May 2025 was an easy Lib Dem hold: 51% for the Liberal Democrats, 16% for Reform UK and 11% for the Conservatives.  This was on the same day as the Kent county council elections, in which the Lib Dems gained Tunbridge Wells North from the Conservatives - in fact, all four county divisions covering Tunbridge Wells town were Lib Dem gains from the Conservatives in May.  The voters of St John's ward are now being called out for their second by-election of the year to replace Matt Fox, who stood down last month for personal reasons.
</p><p>
Defending this seat for the Lib Dems is Ukonu Obasi, who was their parliamentary candidate for Gravesham last year; Obasi works in the public health sector and is an advocate for independence for Biafra.  Several losing candidates from May's by-election here are trying again including the runner-up: Reform UK's Chris Hoare has previous local government experience, having served from 2013 to 2017 as a UKIP county councillor for Tunbridge Wells East.  The Conservatives have changed candidate to David Sumner, who appears to be fighting his first election campaign.  Also standing are Kate Sergeant for the Greens and candidates for two localist parties in a sort of People's Front of Judea situation: they are Kit Hawes-Webb for the Tunbridge Wells Alliance and Joe Dore for the Independents for Tunbridge Wells.  A further would-be independent candidate had his nomination ruled to be invalid, which leaves us with a ballot paper of six candidates.

<h2>Hendon</h2>
</p><p>
Barnet council, London; caused by the disqualification of Conservative councillor Joshua Conway.
</p><p>
Our London ward this week is in the north of the capital, in an area crisscrossed by a number of London's arterial routes: the boundaries of this ward are defined by M1 motorway and the Midland railway line to the west, the A1 to the north, the A41 to the south and the North Circular Road to the east.
</p><p>
Within these arterial routes we find Hendon, a rather upmarket north London suburb.  Hendon was an old village centred around St Mary's church, which is known to have existed by 1080, and which became an urban district of Middlesex in the 1890s.  Hendon Town Hall was erected shortly afterwards and is still in use totday for full meetings of the successor local authority, Barnet council.  Between the church and the town hall can be found the main campus of Middlesex University, which grew out of a number of predecessor institutions including the Hendon Technical Institute which opened here in 1939.
</p><p>
The Church End area which covers all this is in the west of Hendon ward, whose housing extends uphill towards the junction of the A1 and the North Circular at Henlys Corner.  In the south of the ward can be found Hendon Central Underground station, whcih lies on the Edgware branch of the Northern line and links the ward to central London.
</p><p>
Hendon ward makes several of the top 100 demographic lists this column looks at.  It is in the top 50 wards in England and Wales for "other" ethnic groups (12.6%) and in the top 60 for the White Other ethnic group (27.7%).  It is in the top 40 wards for residents working in real-estate activities (4.2%).  And it ranks number 10 of the wards in England and Wales for Judaism, at 32.6% of the population.  Hendon ward has a large number of synagogues to serve its residents.
</p><p>
The Hendon parliamentary seat has been a bellwether marginal since its recreation in 1997, but only just so.  In the 2024 general election this seat had the closest result of any constituency in the UK, with Labour's David Pinto-Duschinsky gaining Hendon from the Conservatives by 15,855 votes to 15,840, a majority of 15 votes or 0.04%.  Don't let anybody tell you your vote never changed anything.  Pinto-Duschinsky, who won the seat at his second attempt, had been president of the Oxford Union in 1995 before settling into a previous career in professional services.
</p><p>
Hendon had previously seen a photofinish at the 2010 general election, when it was a Conservative gain by 106 votes.  Matthew Offord, who went on to serve the seat for 14 years, had previously had eight years on Barnet council as one of the three councillors for Hendon ward.  Barnet council as a whole has been a tougher nut for Labour to crack, and Labour never had a majority on the council until 2022; Hendon ward, however, remains safely in the Conservative column.  The 2022 elections here gave 48% to the Conservatives, 26% to Labour and 10% to an independent candidate.  One of the ward's Conservative councillors, Mark Shooter, has since walked off to join Reform UK.
</p><p>
This by-election is to replace another Conservative.  Joshua Conway is a rabbi who is the headteacher at the Nancy Reuben primary school, a Jewish school located within the ward.  This had been an independent school, but as a result of financial difficulties - which the school have blamed on the imposition of VAT on private school fees - Nancy Reuben has now joined the state sector with funding from Barnet council.  This means that Conway is now a Barnet council employee, and he has been disqualified as a councillor on that basis: drawing a wage from a council which you sit on is a very obvious conflict of interest.
</p><p>
Defending the resulting by-election for the Conservatives is Shimon Ryde, who is seeking to return to Barnet council after a few years away: Ryde had previously been elected as a Conservative councillor in Childs Hill ward in 2018, but he quit the party in 2021 and didn't seek re-election the following year.  It would appear he is now back in the Tory fold.  Labour have selected Lewis Harrison, who appears to be standing for election for the first time.  The independent from 2022 has not returned, so completing the ballot are Gabrielle Bailey for the Greens, Jeremy Walsh for the Lib Dems, Yosef David for Reform UK and Ben Rend for Rejoin EU, a party whose signature policy is left as an exercise for the reader.

<h2>Roebuck</h2>
</p><p>
Stevenage council, Hertfordshire; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Anne Wells.
</p><p>
We now travel north from London to the New Town of Stevenage.  Roebuck ward occupies the south-west corner of the town and is the first part of Stevenage that those entering from the south on the A1(M) or the railway line will see.  The Roebuck name comes from a fifteenth-century inn on the B197 London Road, which was the Great North Road in the days when all this was fields.  The housing here is mostly from the New Town years, and Roebuck's housing stock is still 30% socially rented; the ward also creeps into the top 100 wards in England and Wales for households in shared ownership, which make up 4.4% of the total.
</p><p>
The residential area of Roebuck ward is its eastern half, including the open space of Shephalbury Park.  The western half of the ward, to the south of Stevenage town centre, is mostly given over to industry.  A prominent employer here is the pharmaceutical giant Glaxo SmithKline, whose global research and development hub is located within the ward.  Next to the A1(M) motorway junction is the Novotel hotel, which for quite some time now has been closed to the public and used as accommodation for asylum seekers; it's fair to say that Stevenage council are not happy about this.  Roebuck ward also includes Broadhall Way, the home ground of Stevenage FC who have made a good start to their current season in EFL League One.
</p><p>
Stevenage FC's colours are red and white, which matches the political complexion of Stevenage council.  This has had a Labour majority continuously since the 1974 reorganisation; the 2024 election, in which all councillors were up for re-election on on new ward boundaries, returned 24 Labour councillors against six Lib Dems and a single Conservative.
</p><p>
Roebuck ward has voted Conservative in this century, with the exception of Conservative wins in 2021 and a 2017 by-election.  In 2024 Labour, who were the only party to field a full slate, won with 39% against 23% for the Conservatives, 17% for the Lib Dems and 15% for the Green Party.  In order to allow the previous thirds electoral cycle to be restored in coming years, the winning councillors were given 4, 3 and 2 year terms depending on whether they were first, second or third repsectively; which caused a minor problem when Labour candidates Forhad Chowdhury and Alistair Gordon tied for second and third place on 701 votes each.  The rules in this situation (article 4 of the Stevenage (Electoral Changes) Order 2023) state that:
</p><p>
<blockquote>
(5) In the case of an equality of votes between any persons elected which makes it uncertain which of them is to retire in any year, the person to retire in that year is to be determined by lot. ...
</p><p>
(8) Where under this article any question is to be determined by lot, the lot is to be drawn at the next practicable meeting of the council after the question has arisen and the drawing is to be conducted under the direction of the person presiding at the meeting.
</blockquote>
</p><p>
Well, that's what the rules <em>say</em>, but this column has never heard of an occasion where the next council meeting actually carried out the tiebreak procedure as required by paragraph (8).  In practice, ties in this category always seem to be broken by the returning officer at the count, and that's what happened here.  The declaration of Roebuck ward's 2024 result specified that Forhad Chowdhury would serve for three years and Alistair Gordon for two, so presumably the lot fell on Chowdhury.
</p><p>
This might be something for Stevenage's Labour MP to look at at some point, as Kevin Bonavia has some expertise in this area: he is a Maltese-born solicitor who has previously acted for the Labour Party in electoral law cases.  He gained the bellwether Stevenage constituency, which is larger and more Conservative-inclined than the borough, from the Conservatives in 2024.
</p><p>
Having won it all in July 2024, Stevenage Labour then lost it all in May 2025 when the town's Hertfordshire county council seats split five to Reform UK and one to the Lib Dems.  Roebuck ward is part of the Broadwater county division, which RUK gained from the Conservatives five months ago.
</p><p>
Against this backdrop Labour will have to defend this seat following the resignation of Anne Wells, who stood down last month due to "ongoing long-term health conditions and personal circumstances".  Wells was first elected for this ward in 2022 and re-elected at the top of the poll in 2024, beating her Labour running-mates who were higher up the alphabetical ballot paper: that's normally a good sign of a personal vote.
</p><p>
Defending this seat for Labour is Thea Pendlebury, who turned up in this column in February as the Labour candidate for a by-election in Stevenage's Manor ward: that's a safe Lib Dem area, but Roebuck ward should be more promising territory for her.  The Conservatives have made an interesting candidate choice in Polish-born Pawel Gora, a recent recruit to the party who stood in this ward last year on the Green Party ticket.  Also returning from last year is Nigel Bye, who has been the regular Lib Dem candidate for Roebuck ward in recent years.  This time round the Greens have nominated Glen Rozemont, a gardener who stood here in May's county elections.  And completing the ballot paper is Reform UK's Rob Henry, who was that party's only unsuccessful candidate in Stevenage five months ago when he contested the Lib Dem-held Chells division.

<h2>Election Court Watch</h2>
</p><p>
The comments on electoral law in our previous section bring us neatly to the latest edition of Election Court Watch, an occasional series within this column looking at what happens when our elections spill over into the courtroom.
</p><p>
We'll start in the High Court, rather than the Election Court itself, which has recently heard the case of two newly-elected Reform UK county councillors in Exeter, brothers Neil and Tony Stevens, and their election agent Rob Sheridan.  They had been grassed up to Devon and Cornwall police by fellow Reform UK councillor Ed Hill (who is no longer in the party) for going over the campaign spending limit, but the police have now dropped their investigation after the Stevenses and Mr Sheridan successfully applied to the High Court for relief from this breach of election rules.  In granting relief, Mr Justice Spencer ruled that any errors which Neil Stevens and Sheridan made in the expense return were inadvertent while Tony Stevens had no case to answer.  Relief is a get out of jail card, but certainly not a get out of fail <em>free</em> card given the legal costs of getting such an order out of the High Court: expensive lessons will hopefully have been learned here.
</p><p>
Quite how quickly those costs can rack up is illustrated by the now-concluded Election Court case of <em>Williams v Robson</em>, arising out of May's local elections to Worcestershire county council.  As this column has noted on a couple of previous occasions, May's result in the Littletons division ended up as a tie between the Green Party's Hannah Robson and Reform UK's Elizabeth Williams; the returning officer had drawn lots to break the tie, and the lot fell on Robson who was declared elected.
</p><p>
Williams had taken this to the Election Court alleging irregularities in the drawing of lots and at polling stations, but her day in Court last week did not go well.  The returning officer successfully applied to have the case struck out on the grounds that it had been filed after the deadline, and the Court duly upheld Robson's election.  Williams will now have to pay the returning officer's legal costs, estimated at £19,000, in addition to the legal costs of Worcestershire county council and a named West Mercia police officer who had claims against them struck out an an earlier hearing.
</p><p>
Had the case gone to a full trial it would have been much more expensive for Williams, and quite possibly more embarrassing for her.  This column's previous commentary might have given the impression that Williams' case was a weak one: in fact, it turned out to be significantly worse than that, because the judge criticised her for citing nonexistent court cases in her legal filings which appear to have been made up by AI from whole cloth.  Williams had represented herself in the litigation: any qualified lawyer putting fake AI-generated citations before the Court would quickly have ended up in very serious trouble.
</p><p>
<h2>Bromsgrove South</h2>
</p><p>
Worcestershire county council; caused by the resignation of Reform UK councillor Gaynor Jean-Louis.
</p><p>
Staying on the subject of Worcestershire county council, and against this mixed legal backdrop for Reform UK members in the courtroom, we now come to this week's Reform UK by-election defence.  It comes in Bromsgrove, an old market town to the south-west of Birmingham which later became a centre for nailmaking.  Bromgrove South county division covers the southern end of the town plus the parish of Stoke, which is based on the villages of Stoke Heath and Stoke Prior.  Stoke Prior was once home to Europe's largest saltworks, while Stoke Heath - which has now merged into Bromsgrove's built-up area - is home to the Avoncroft Museum of Historic Buildings, an open-air museum where dozens of old and not-so-old buildings have been re-erected.
</p><p>
South division includes Bromsgrove railway station, which was rebuilt on a new site in the last decade as one of two southern termini for West Midlands Trains' Cross-City line and now has half-hourly electric trains to Birmingham and Lichfield.  The previous Bromsgrove station had been the subject of a major accident in 1840 when the boiler of an experimental locomotive called <em>Surprise</em> exploded in the station.  Bromsgrove station lies at the bottom of the formidable Lickey Incline, which at 1 in 37.7 is one of the steepest sustained gradients on the UK railway network, and railway historians have speculated that <em>Surprise</em>'s crew may have tried to create enough steam pressure to get up the incline by screwing down the locomotive's safety valve.  If so, they paid for this dangerous decision with their lives.
</p><p>
Stoke Heath and Stoke Prior have a commuter demographic profile, but this is balanced by the Charford ward in southern Bromsgrove proper which is based on a large council estate.  Charford makes the top 100 wards in England and Wales for adults with level 2 qualfications (5+ GCSEs or equivalent but nothing higher).
</p><p>
In the early years of this century Bromsgove South had been closely fought between the Conservatives and Labour.  The Labour county councillor Christopher Bloore emigrated to Canada in 2019, and the resulting by-election on Hallowe'en proved to be a nightmare for Labour who fell to fourth and last place.  It was won by the Conservatives' Kyle Daisley, who I described as "a 22-year-old Virgin Atlantic flight attendant and parish councillor in Hagley, some miles to the north".
</p><p>
Daisley was re-elected for a full term of office in 2021 and rose to become chairman of the county council for 2023-24.  By this point he was working for Warwickshire police as a special constable, but he resigned from that force in December 2023 after being suspended.  A police disciplinary panel subsequently found that Daisley had set up a fake Facebook proifle under a female name for the purpose of exchanging explicit images with men, and that this amounted to gross misconduct.
</p><p>
Kyle Diasley sought re-election in Bromsgrove South last May as an independent candidate, and finished in sixth and last place with 3% of the vote.  In a result out of kilter with everything that gone before, Bromsgrove South turned into a close contest between Reform UK and the the Liberal Democrats: the eventual result gave 35% to RUK, 32% to the Lib Dems and 17% to the new Conservative candidate.  Boundary changes mean that these figures are not directly comparable with previous years.
</p><p>
The Lib Dems did have some previous strength here, having gained the Avoncroft ward which covers Stoke Heath and Stoke Prior at the 2023 Bromsgrove council elections.  That council is hung with a coalition of Conservative and independent councillors in control.  The Conservatives also hold the Bromsgrove parliamentary seat, which was taken over in 2024 by new face Bradley Thomas who had previosuly been leader of Wychavon council elsewhere in Worcestershire.  He defeated Labour candidate Neena Gill, who had previously served three terms as an MEP for the West Midlands.

Worcestershire county council is hung with Reform UK as the largest party, and they are running a minority administration: May's elections returned 27 Reform UK county councillors against 12 Conservatives, 8 Greens, 6 Lib Dems, 2 Labour and 2 independents.  At the AGM in May the opposition county councillors banded together to install a Green Party chairman, whose casting vote could be crucial in the event of a tie.  It would certainly help the administration's cause if they could get all their councillors to turn up for meetings, something which Bromsgrove South councillor Gaynor Jean-Louis conspicuously failed to do at any point during her four months in office.  She has now stepped down on health grounds.
</p><p>
Defending this seat for Reform UK is Philip Hingley, who will not be helped by having "address in Wyre Forest" next to his name on the ballot paper: Hingley stood in that district in May's county elections, coming second to the Conservatives in Chaddesley division.  The Liberal Democrats' Sam Ammar is back for another go after her runner-up placing in May; Ammar is the Bromsgrove councillor for Charford ward, to which she was elected as a Labour candidate in 2023, and she stood for Parliament last year as an independent candidate for Bromsgrove.  The Conservatives' Matt Dormer, who will not be helped by having "address in Redditch" next to his name on the ballot paper, is nonetheless a high-profile candidate as a former leader of Redditch council and current leader of the opposition Conservative group on that council: he is trying to get back on the county council after he lost his seat in Redditch West in May.  Labour's Laura Rollins completes this ballot.

<h2>Stirling East</h2>
</p><p>
Stirling council, Scotland; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Bryan Flannagan.
</p><p>
For our final by-election of the week we travel north of the Border for a return visit to a ward which featured in this column last December.  Stirling East ward is the less glamorous part of the city of Stirling, based on the Braehead and Broomridge areas to the south of Stirling railway station.  This is generally postwar housing with good motorway links to both Glasgow and Edinburgh.
</p><p>
The ward runs down to the banks of the River Forth, and the riverbank area has been redeveloped as a sports village.  Here the Forthbank Stadium is home to both Stirling Albion and the non-league University of Stirling side, while Stirling County's cricket ground next door hosted several matches in the 2015 World Twenty20 qualifying tournament.
</p><p>
Stirling East ward returns three members of Stirling council.  At its first election in 2007 the three seats split evenly between Labour, the SNP and the Lib Dems, with Labour gaining the Lib Dem seat in 2012.  The ward's SNP councillor Steven Paterson was elected in 2015 as the MP for Stirling and he stood down from the council; the resulting by-election in October 2015 saw the SNP defend their seat by 116 votes over Labour's Chris Kane.  At the time, this column described Kane as "the chairman of Braehead community council who runs a media production company".
</p><p>
Kane eventually get in at the 2017 Stirling council elections, defeating the outgoing Labour councillor Corrie McChord who had been the last leader of the Central Regional Council.  On that occasion Stirling East ward split its three seats between the SNP, Labour and the Conservatives.  That balance was retained in 2022, with the first preferences splitting 39% for the SNP, 23% for the Conservatives and 22% for Labour.  Recounting the votes for a single seat gives an SNP lead of 62-38 over the Conservatives.
</p><p>

</p><p>
Overall, the 2022 Stirling council elections returned 8 SNP councillors, 7 Conservatives, 6 Labour, 1 Green and 1 independent.  The council has the same boundaries as the Stirling Scottish Parliament constituency, which has been in SNP hands since 2007; its MSP, Evelyn Tweed, is standing down next year after one term office.
</p><p>
Tweed may have been first past the post here in 2021, but the council has a Unionist majority and a left-wing majority, and so Labour run a minority administration - but their ranks are now down to just four councillors.  Chris Kane became leader of the council in 2022, but in July 2024 he was elected as the Labour MP for Stirling and Strathallan - defeating the SNP's Alyn Smith by 1,394 votes despite unfavourable boundary changes for Labour.  He stood down as a councillor in September and a special meeting of the council elected as the new leader Margaret Brisley, a veteran Labour councillor for Bannockburn ward.  But then she suddenly died just six weeks later.
</p><p>
Labour went on to lose both of the resulting by-elections to the SNP.  In the Stirling East by-election last December first preferences were 35% for the SNP, 26% for Labour (whose candidate on that occasion was Chris Kane's wife Anne), 14% for Reform UK and 12% for the Conservatives; after votes for Reform UK, the Conservatives and other candidates had been redistributed, the SNP won by 55-45 over Labour.
</p><p>
This will give some encouragement to the SNP, who now have the chance to complete the set of three Stirling East ward councillors following the resignation of the Conservatives' Bryan Flannagan.  He is a former Royal Navy submarine officer who now runs a firm which provides education and training to mariners, and he left Stirling council in August as a result of increasing professional commitments.  Flannagan was first elected for this ward in 2017.
</p><p>
The Conservatives' fourth-place performance in last year's by-election suggests that their defending candidate James Corbett has a moutain to climb.  He runs the office of a Conservative MSP.  The new SNP candidate Josh Fyvie is a student reading law at Stirling University, where he is president of the Scottish Nationalist association.  Labour have changed candidate to Yvonne Dickson, who finished second in the Bannockburn ward by-election in January.  Reform UK's William Docherty, a semi-retired HGV driver, is back for another go after his third-place finishes at both last year's Stirling East by-election and the Bannockborn by-election earlier this year; on both of those occasions, he polled vote shares which would probably have won Reform UK a seat at an ordinary election.  The Greens' Marie Stadtler and the Lib Dems' William Galloway complete a list of six candidates.  This is a Scottish local by-election, so the usual disclaimers apply: Votes at 16 and the Alternative Vote are in use.
