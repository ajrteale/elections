<h2>St John's</h2>

Tunbridge Wells council, Kent; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Matthew Fox.

We now come to a very different area of Kent: the spa town of Tunbridge Wells.  St John's ward lies in the north of the town around St John's primary school and to the east of St John's Road, which here is the A26 towards Sevenoaks and London.  All of these clearly derive their name from St John's church, which was built on the main road in the late 1850s; however, the church in fact lies just outside the ward boundary.  The ward's most prominent feature is the Skinners' School, a boys' grammar school founded here in 1887 by the Worshipful Company of Skinners; this school educated one present MP, the East Worthing and Shoreham Labour representative Tom Rutland.

Tunbridge Wells has been ground zero for the Conservative collapse in recent years, as the town's middle-class electorate - and St John's ward is no exception to that pattern - have recoiled in disgust from what the Conservative party has become and instead filled in their ballot papers for the Liberal Democrat candidates.  Probably in green ink.  The Lib Dems took overall control of Tunbridge Wells council at all-out elections in May 2024, after two years of leading a coalition administration, and two months later Mike Martin became the first Lib Dem MP for Tunbridge Wells since the modern seat was created in 1974.  Martin is a former Army officer who served in Afghanistan and dealt directly with the Taliban; he resigned his commission in 2014 so that he could publish his PhD thesis on the history of the Helmand conflict.

Unlike Afghanistan, we have a democracy in this country and political disputes here are settled with ballots rather than arms.  St John's ward was often closely fought between the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats until 2015, but since then the Conservative vote here has collapsed and the Lib Dems are now on a long winning streak.  All-out elections here in 2024 gave 49% to the Liberal Democrat slate, 26% to Labour and just 13% to the Conservatives.

The two councillors elected here in 2024 were Peter Lidstone and Matthew Fox.  Both of them have since resigned from the council.  Lidstone stood down in March to spend more time with his family, and the resulting by-election in May 2025 was an easy Lib Dem hold: 51% for the Liberal Democrats, 16% for Reform UK and 11% for the Conservatives.  This was on the same day as the Kent county council elections, in which the Lib Dems gained Tunbridge Wells North from the Conservatives - in fact, all four county divisions covering Tunbridge Wells town were Lib Dem gains from the Conservatives in May.  The voters of St John's ward are now being called out for their second by-election of the year to replace Matt Fox, who stood down last month for personal reasons.

Defending this seat for the Lib Dems is Ukonu Obasi, who was their parliamentary candidate for Gravesham last year; Obasi works in the public health sector and is an advocate for independence for Biafra.  Several losing candidates from May's by-election here are trying again including the runner-up: Reform UK's Chris Hoare has previous local government experience, having served from 2013 to 2017 as a UKIP county councillor for Tunbridge Wells East.  The Conservatives have changed candidate to David Sumner, who appears to be fighting his first election campaign.  Also standing are Kate Sergeant for the Greens and candidates for two localist parties in a sort of People's Front of Judea situation: they are Kit Hawes-Webb for the Tunbridge Wells Alliance and Joe Dore for the Independents for Tunbridge Wells.  A further independent had his nomination ruled invalid, which leaves us with a ballot paper of six candidates.

<h2>Hendon</h2>

Barnet council, London; caused by the disqualification of Conservative councillor Joshua Conway.

Our London ward this week is in the north of the capital, in an area crisscrossed by a number of London's arterial routes: the boundaries of this ward are defined by M1 motorway and the Midland railway line to the west, the A1 to the north, the A41 to the south and the North Circular Road to the east.

Within these arterial routes we find Hendon, a rather upmarket north London suburb.  Hendon was an old village centred around St Mary's church, which is known to have existed by 1080, and which became an urban district of Middlesex in the 1890s.  Hendon Town Hall was erected shortly afterwards and is still in use totday for full meetings of the successor local authority, Barnet council.  Between the church and the town hall can be found the main campus of Middlesex University, which grew out of a number of predecessor institutions including the Hendon Technical Institute which opened here in 1939.

The Church End area which covers all this is in the west of Hendon ward, whose housing extends uphill towards the junction of the A1 and the North Circular at Henlys Corner.  In the south of the ward can be found Hendon Central Underground station, whcih lies on the Edgware branch of the Northern line and links the ward to central London.

Hendon ward makes several of the top 100 demographic lists this column looks at.  It is in the top 50 wards in England and Wales for "other" ethnic groups (12.6%) and in the top 60 for the White Other ethnic group (27.7%).  It is in the top 40 wards for residents working in real-estate activities (4.2%).  And it ranks number 10 of the wards in England and Wales for Judaism, at 32.6% of the population.  Hendon ward has a large number of synagogues to serve its residents.

The Hendon parliamentary seat has been a bellwether marginal since its recreation in 1997, but only just so.  In the 2024 general election this seat had the closest result of any constituency in the UK, with Labour's David Pinto-Duschinsky gaining Hendon from the Conservatives by 15,855 votes to 15,840, a majority of 15 votes or 0.04%.  Don't let anybody tell you your vote never changed anything.  Pinto-Duschinsky, who won the seat at his second attempt, had been president of the Oxford Union in 1995 before settling into a previous career in professional services.

Hendon had previously seen a photofinish at the 2010 general election, when it was a Conservative gain by 106 votes.  Matthew Offord, who went on to serve the seat for 14 years, had previously had eight years on Barnet council as one of the three councillors for Hendon ward.  Barnet council as a whole has been a tougher nut for Labour to crack, and Labour never had a majority on the council until 2022; Hendon ward, however, remains safely in the Conservative column.  The 2022 elections here gave 48% to the Conservatives, 26% to Labour and 10% to an independent candidate.  One of the ward's Conservative councillors, Mark Shooter, has since walked off to join Reform UK.

This by-election is to replace another Conservative.  Joshua Conway is a rabbi who is the headteacher at the Nancy Reuben primary school, a Jewish school located within the ward.  This had been an independent school, but as a result of financial difficulties - which the school have blamed on the imposition of VAT on private school fees - Nancy Reuben has now joined the state sector with funding from Barnet council.  This means that Conway is now a Barnet council employee, and he has been disqualified as a councillor on that basis: drawing a wage from a council which you sit on is a very obvious conflict of interest.

Defending the resulting by-election for the Conservatives is Shimon Ryde, who is seeking to return to Barnet council after a few years away: Ryde had previously been elected as a Conservative councillor in Childs Hill ward in 2018, but he quit the party in 2021 and didn't seek re-election the following year.  It would appear he is now back in the Tory fold.  Labour have selected Lewis Harrison, who appears to be standing for election for the first time.  The independent from 2022 has not returned, so completing the ballot are Gabrielle Bailey for the Greens, Jeremy Walsh for the Lib Dems, Yosef David for Reform UK and Ben Rend for Rejoin EU, a party whose signature policy is left as an exercise for the reader.

<h2>Election Court Watch</h2>

Our next by-election is in Worcestershire, which brings us to the conclusion of an Election Court case arising out of May's local elections in Worcestershire.  As this column has noted on a couple of previous occasions, May's result in the Littletons division ended up as a tie between the Green Party's Hannah Robson and Reform UK's Elizabeth Williams; the returning officer had drawn lots to break the tie, and the lot fell on Robson who was declared elected.

Williams had taken this to the Election Court alleging irregularities in the drawing of lots and at polling stations, but her day in Court last week did not go well.  The returning officer successfully applied to have the case struck out on the grounds that it had been filed after the deadline, and the Court duly upheld Robson's election.  Williams will now have to pay the returning officer's legal costs, estimated at £19,000, in addition to the legal costs of Worcestershire county council and a named West Mercia police officer who had the claims against them struck out an an earlier hearing.

Had the case gone to a full trial it would have been much more expensive for Williams, and quite possibly more embarrassing for her.  As it was, the judge criticised Williams for citing nonexistent court cases in her legal filings which appear to have been made up by AI from whole cloth.  Williams had represented herself in the litigation: any lawyer putting fake AI-generated citations before the Court would quickly have ended up in very serious trouble.

In other legal news, earlier this month the High Court heard the case of two newly-elected Reform UK county councillors in Exeter, brothers Neil and Tony Stevens, and their election agent Rob Sheridan.  They had been grassed up to Devon and Cornwall police by fellow Reform UK councillor Ed Hill (who is no longer in the party) for overspending on their election campaign, but the police have now dropped their investigation after the Stevenses and Mr Sheridan successfully applied to the High Court for relief from this breach of election rules.  In granting relief, Mr Justice Spencer ruled that any errors which Neil Stevens and Sheridan made in the expense return were inadvertent while Tony Stevens had no case to answer.  Relief is a get out of jail card, but certainly not a get out of fail <em>free</em> card given the legal costs of getting such an order out of the High Court: expensive lessons will hopefully have been learned here.

<h2>Bromsgrove South</h2>

Worcestershire county council; caused by the resignation of Reform UK councillor Gaynor Jean-Louis.

Against this mixed legal backdrop for Reform UK in recent legal cases, we now come to this week's Reform UK by-election defence.  It comes in Bromsgrove, an old market town to the south-west of Birmingham which later became a centre for nailmaking.  Bromgrove South county division covers the southern end of the town plus the parish of Stoke, which is based on the villages of Stoke Heath and Stoke Prior.  Stoke Prior was once home to Europe's largest saltworks, while Stoke Heath - which has now merged into Bromsgrove's built-up area - is home to the Avoncroft Museum of Historic Buildings, an open-air museum where dozens of old and not-so-old buildings have been re-erected.

South division includes Bromsgrove railway station, which was rebuilt on a new site in the last decade as one of two southern termini for West Midlands Trains' Cross-City line and now has half-hourly electric trains to Birmingham and Lichfield.  The previous Bromsgrove station had been the subject of a major accident in 1840 when the boiler of an experimental locomotive called <em>Surprise</em> exploded in the station.  Bromsgrove station lies at the bottom of the formidable Lickey Incline, which at 1 in 37.7 is one of the steepest sustained gradients on the UK railway network, and railway historians have speculated that <em>Surprise</em>'s crew may have tried to create enough steam pressure to get up the incline by screwing down the locomotive's safety valve.  If so, they paid for this dangerous decision with their lives.

Stoke Heath and Stoke Prior have a commuter demographic profile, but this is balanced by the Charford ward in southern Bromsgrove proper which is based on a large council estate.  Charford makes the top 100 wards in England and Wales for adults with level 2 qualfications (5+ GCSEs or equivalent but nothing higher).

In the early years of this century Bromsgove South had been closely fought between the Conservatives and Labour.  The Labour county councillor Christopher Bloore emigrated to Canada in 2019, and the resulting by-election on Hallowe'en proved to be a nightmare for Labour who fell to fourth and last place.  It was won by the Conservatives' Kyle Daisley, who I described as "a 22-year-old Virgin Atlantic flight attendant and parish councillor in Hagley, some miles to the north".

Daisley was re-elected for a full term of office in 2021 and rose to become chairman of the county council for 2023-24.  By this point he was working for Warwickshire police as a special constable, but he resigned from that force in December 2023 after being suspended.  A disciplinary panel subsequently found that Daisley had set up a fake Facebook proifle under a female name for the purpose of exchanging explicit images with men, and this amounted to gross misconduct.

Diasley sought re-election in May this year as an independent candidate, and finished in sixth and last place with 3% of the vote.  In a result out of kilter with everything that gone before, Bromsgrove South turned into a close contest between Reform UK and the the Liberal Democrats: the eventual result gave 35% to RUK, 32% to the Lib Dems and 17% to the new Conservative candidate.

The Lib Dems did have some previous strength here, having gained the Avoncroft ward which covers Stoke Heath and Stoke Prior at the 2023 Bromsgrove council elections.  This council is hung with a coalition of Conservative and independent councillors in control.  The Conservatives also hold the Bromsgrove parliamentary seat, which was taken over in 2024 by new face Bradley Thomas who had previosuly been leader of Wychavon council.  (He defeated Labour candidate Neena Gill, who had previously served three terms as an MEP for the West Midlands.)

Worcestershire county council is hung with Reform UK as the largest party, and they are running a minority administration: May's elections returned 27 Reform UK county councillors against 12 Conservatives, 8 Greens, 6 Lib Dems, 2 Labour and 2 independents.  At the AGM in May the opposition county councillors banded together to install a Green Party chairman, whose casting vote could be crucial in the event of a tie.  It would certainly help the administration's cause if they could get all their councillors to turn up for meetings, something which Bromsgrove South councillor Gaynor Jean-Louis failed to do during her four months in office.  She has now stepped down on health grounds.

Defending this seat for Reform UK is Philip Hingley, who will not be helped by having "address in Wyre Forest" next to his name on the ballot paper: Hingley stood in that district in May's county elections, coming second to the Conservatives in Chaddesley division.  The Liberal Democrats' Sam Ammar is back for another go after her runner-up placing in May; Ammar is the Bromsgrove councillor for Charford ward, to which she was elected as a Labour candidate in 2023, and she stood for Parliament last year as an independent candidate for Bromsgrove.  The Conservatives' Matt Dormer, who will not be helped by having "address in Redditch" next to his name on the ballot paper, is nonetheless a high-profile candidate as a former leader of Redditch council and current leader of the opposition Conservative group on that council: he is trying to get back on the county council after he lost his seat in Redditch West in May.  Labour's Laura Rollins completes this ballot.
