Six by-elections on 4th December 2025:

<h2>Nunthorpe</h2>

Middlesbrough council, North Yorkshire; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Morgan McClintock.

It's unlikely that there will be a results service from your columnist tonight, because I'm away in York this evening playing music for the first night of York Minster's Christmas carol concerts.  (If you don't have a ticket alreafy, sorry: both nights are completely sold out.)  And it's in Yorkshire that we start this week's column.

Nunthorpe lise in the oouth-eastern corner of the borough of Middlesbrough, and it is essentially the Teesside equivalent of an outer London middle-class railway suburb.  This was quite a small place before Nunthorpe railway station opened in 1854, leading a number of the great figures of Middlesbrough's industry to build homes here.  For example, Sir Arthur Dorman - the Dorman in the steelmakers Dorman Long - had a large house here called Grey Towers which is now apartments, and in the early 20th century he had a small suburb built around the railway station for Dorman Long steelworkers.

These were large houses with large gardens, and subsequent housing development in Nunthorpe - of which there has been quite a lot - has continued on that theme.  Nunthorpe railway station is still in operation, with hourly trains north to Middlesbrough town centre and less frequent trains in the other direction on the branch line to Whitby.  In the 1970s British Rail opened Gypsy Lane station, to serve the housing at the northern end of this ward.

In the 2021 census Nunthorpe made the top 20 wards in England and Wales for owner-occupation, at 91.9% of households - the highest figure for any ward in Yorkshire past or present.  It is in the top 75 wards for households with two cars (44.0%), and it is clearly Middlesbrough's most middle-class ward.  This is not inconsistent with the fact that Nunthorpe is in the top 20 wards in England and Wales for residents employed in mining or quarrying (2.8%): that statistic is driven by commuting from here to the Boulby potash mine, which is a major employer in the Cleveland area.

Nunthorpe is part of the Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland parliamentary seat, which was a Labour gain from the Conservatives in 2024; this was one of the few seats where Reform UK had no candidate last year, resulting a close contest where Labour's Luke Myer just edged out former Truss Cabinet minister Simon Clarke.

At Middlesbrough council level Nunthorpe's demographic has traditionally given the Conservatives a high floor, but that hasn't always been enough for them to win here.  In 2007 the ward's two Conservative councillors successfully sought re-election as independents; it took until 2019 for the Tories to get even one seat back, and then only by nine votes.

Nunthorpe ward's other seat on that occasion went to re-elected independent Jon Rathmell, who subsequently entered the Councillors Behaving Badly file over a November 2018 fireworks display which he had tried to organise on behalf of Nunthorpe parish council.  The firm which Rathmell had booked to supply the fireworks for Bonfire Night cancelled and offered an alternative date, but Rathmell instead decided to keep the original date, buy £2,000 of fireworks and set them off himself.  Which might have worked, except that the budget for the event was only £1,500.  Rathmell then tried to cover up the mess he'd got himself into by forging emails from the original supplier, at which point the police got involved.  The eventual outcome of this was that Rathmell pleaded guilty to a single charge of misconduct in public office: after hearing evidence that there was no financial motivation involved, in May 2021 a sympathetic judge at Teesside crown court gave him a two-year conditional discharge on the grounds that the damage to Rathmell's reputation was punishment enough.  He had already been forced to resign as a chair of Middlesbrough council's standards committee.

Having lit the blue touchpaper on his reputation, Rathmell elected not to retire immediately and he stayed on as a Middlesbrough councillor.  In fact he sought re-election in 2023, and performed very badly.  The beneficiary of this was the Liberal Democrats, who had little previous track record in Nunthorpe but do have strength in neighbouring wards of Redcar and Cleveland district.  Shares of the vote were 36% for the Lib Dems, 35% for the Conservatives and 19% for independent candidate Wade Tovey, with Conservative councillor Mieka Smiles being re-elected and the Lib Dem's Morgan McClintock gaining the seat which independent Rathmell had previously held.  Middlesbrough council as a whole has a Labour mayor and a Labour council majority, so it can be seen that Nunthorpe is well outide the borough's political mainstream.

Morgan McClintock quit Middlesbrough council in October.  His resignation statement expressed frustration with an unnamed individual who had been making life difficult for him with "offensive personal comments and a stream of accusations - including asking the police to investigate alleged procedural deficiencies."  McClintock went on to say:

<blockquote>
"Although we are well on the way to start a new era with the opening of Nunthorpe’s Community Centre, Middlesbrough Council has even been asked to review whether the consortium of current local leaders should continue to manage this project.

In this unstable environment, I have come to the conclusion that the residents of Nunthorpe should be given the opportunity of an election to choose the way forward."
</blockquote>

Defending this seat for the Liberal Democrats is Adrian Walker, a retired sales executive who is the chair of Nunthorpe parish council.  The Conservatives have selected former parish councillor Martin Lyon, who was their unsuccessful candidate in 2023 a long way behind his running-mate Mieka Smiles; Lyon has previously spent 28 years in a leadership role with Tesco.  This time there is no independent candidate so a fair number of votes are up for grabs: hoping to capitalise on this are Labour's Richard Lewis, the Green Party's Sam Boardman and Reform UK's Joanne Rush.

<h2>Stapleford South East</h2>

Broxtowe council, Nottinghamshire; caused by the death of Ross Bofinger.
<!--elected for Lab, later Broxtowe All-->

On Tuesday this column was covering a by-election to Derbyshire county council in Long Eaton.  Now it's time to travel a little to the north of here and over the county boundary to Stapleford, another of the towns to the west of Nottingham which have merged together into a single urban area.  Originally Stapleford was a small market town on the old road from Derby to Nottingham which specialised in the Nottinghamshire hosiery trade; now it's a bit of a Nottingham dormitory town.  Commuting from here was enhanced a decade ago with the opening of the Nottingham tram terminus at Toton Lane, just to the south of Stapleford South East ward.

The small towns to the west of Nottingham are covered by the borough of Broxtowe and the Broxtowe parliamentary seat, which take their name from a former wapentake of Nottinghamshire.  The modern Broxtowe constituency - and it is necessary to put the word "modern" in there because the Broxtowe constituency of 1918-55 covered a very different area - was created in 1983 and it is a bellwether, having voted for the winning party at all nine general elections since then.  The Labour MP here since 2024 has been Juliet Campbell, who was so confident of victory last year that she resigned her previous seat on Lewisham council in London when the general election was called.

Broxtowe council, which covers s aimilar area to the constituency, has been tougher going for the Conservatives because it has more often not returned a hung council in recent years, with the Liberal Democrats either holding the balance of power or taking the council leadership for themselves.  Stapleford South East was a safe Lib Dem ward until 2015, the only year in this century when the Conservatives won overall control of Broxtowe council; in that year this ward fell to the Conservative slate of Christopher Rice and Adam Stockwell.

Christopher Rice died just before he was due to seek re-election for a second term of office in May 2019.  In consequence the poll in Stapleford South East ward had to be postponed to 13th June, setting up a crucial contest.  The other Broxtowe wards had polled as scheduled and returned 20 Conservative councillors, 14 Labour, 5 Lib Dems, 2 independents and one Zadroznyite Ashfield Independent.  The Conservatives had lost their majority, and the long-serving Broxtowe Labour leader Milan Radulovic - who had first become leader of the council all the way back in 1995 - had formed a rainbow coalition of all the other parties; but the AGM had also elected a Conservative mayor, and if the Tories held their two seats in Stapleford South East then they would be in a position to depose the rainbow coalition and take back control on the mayoral casting vote.  With control of the council at stake, Stapleford South East returned the Liberal Democrat slate and the Tories' defeat was confirmed.

The 2023 Broxtowe council election then returned a Labour majority with 26 seats against 10 Conservatives, 5 Lib Dems and 3 independents, allowing Radulovic to dump his coalition partners and rule alone.  Stapleford South East was gained by Labour in that election in a fragmented result: just 29% for the winning Labour slate against 24% for the Lib Dems, 21% for the Conservatives and 15% for independent candidates.

Then in 2025 it was all change again.  At the start of the year, 20 of the 26 Labour councillors - including the council leader Milan Radulovic - walked out of the party and formed a new left-wing group called the Broxtowe Alliance, which remains in minority control of the council.  The latest composition has 18 Broxtowe Alliance councillors, 10 Conservatives, 7 members of the rump Labour group, 5 members of the Broxtowe Independent Group, 3 Lib Dems and this vacancy.

Both the Broxtowe Alliance and the Broxtowe Independent Group have registered as political parties with the Electoral Commission, and they won one seat each at the 2025 Nottinghamshire county council elections.  Stapleford South East is part of the large Stapleford and Broxtowe Central division which returns two county councillors.  In 2021 this division had split its two seats between the Conservatives' John Doddy and Labour's Maggie McGrath, and both of them sought re-election on new political tickets.  Doddy was re-elected at the top of the poll as a Reform UK candidate, and he is now the deputy leader of the county council with a seat on the East Midlands Combined Authority to go with it.  In a fragmented result Reform UK won both seats in Stapleford and Broxtowe Central with 29% of the vote, against 15% for the Broxtowe Independent Group, 11% for the outgoing Labour county councillor Maggie McGrath as the Broxtowe Alliance candidate, 10% each for Labour and the Conservatives whose lead candidates tied for fifth and sixth place on 829 votes each, and 9% for the Liberal Democrats.  A total of fourteen candidates applied to stand in Stapleford and Broxtowe Central in May, but only 13 of them made it onto the ballot after the returning officer rejected as invalid a nomination from someone calling themselves "English-Independence Hang-Murderers".

The Conservatives narrowly held off Reform UK in a Broxtowe by-election in Nuthall East and Strelley ward in August.  We now have a fascinating by-election in Stapleford South East to replace the late Ross Bofinger, who had served the ward since 2023 and had recently retired from a long career as a science techer.  Bofinger passed away at the end of August, so this by-election has taken quite some time to organise.  He was elected for Labour but was one of the councillors who defected to form the Broxtowe Alliance in January, and at the time Bofinger published a photograph of a cut-up Labour membership card on his social media with the statement "I'm leaving the Labour party because it has grown increasingly distant from ordinary people".

If we take the Broxtowe Alliance as the defending party here, then the defending candidate is Sarah Camplin who, according to the party, "has spent her adult life working in the voluntary sector providing support to adults and children with complex and additional needs".  Labour will want their defection loss back, and they have selected Stapleford town councillor Keith Bacon who was the lead Labour candidate here in May's county elections.  The Liberal Democrats have nominated Simon Roche, who has over 20 years' experience in investment banking and has recently been a regular local election candidate in the Toton and Chilwell area to the south.  The Conservatives have reselected Bradley Bell, who stood here in 2023 and was also on their slate for the 2025 county elections in Stapleford and Broxtowe Central.  Another returning candidate from 2023 is independent candidate and Stapleford town councillor Lorraine Gerry, who stood here last time under her previous surname of Longford.  And Reform UK have recruited to their cause Sunny Limbachia, who was an unsuccessful Conservative candidate in the 2023 Broxtowe elections (in Bramcote ward) and for the 2025 county elections (in Bramcote and Beeston North).

<h2>Tudor</h2>

Watford council, Hertfordshire; caused by the disqualification of Liberal Democrat councillor Charlott Saunders.

We now travel to the south of England for the rest of this week's column, starting within the M25 in the town of Watford.  The Tudor estate is a series of interwar terraces which lie north of the town centre, located at the eastern end of North Watford and served by Watford North railway station on the St Albans Abbey branch line.  Between the Tudor estate and the town centre is a large business park next to Watford Junction railway station, where the head offices of the DIY chain Wickes and the pub company J D Wetherspoon can be found.  Wetherspoons might well be disappointed that the Tudor Arms pub, which serves the Tudor estate, is owned by Greene King.

Like most of Watford, this slice of suburbia has a large difference between Parliamentary and local voting patterns.  The Watford parliamentary seat is a key marginal which has voted for the winning party at every general election since 1955 with the exception of 1970, and thus it was a Labour gain in 2024.

Watford's Labour MP Matt Turmaine had previously been one of the few opposition members of Watford council.   The town has been run by a Liberal Democrat elected mayor continuously since 2002, and the Lib Dems also have a stranglehold on the council: the latest composition has 29 Lib Dems plus this vacancy against six Labour councillors.  Tudor ward, as this column noted when previewing a previous by-election in October 2019, has voted Liberal Democrat at every opportunity since 2003 with the exception of a Conservative win in 2015; by May 2024 the Tories had fallen to third place with 20%, behind Labour on 23% and the Lib Dems on 47%.

Watford is now just one of a series of Liberal Democrat-run councils in western Hertfordshire, and that enabled the Lib Dems to become the largest party on Hertfordshire county council in May.  They now run Hertfordshire as a minority administration.  Most of this ward is part of Meriden Tudor county division, which is based on those two Watford wards: seven months ago Meriden Tudor was a Lib Dem hold with 40% of the vote, against 30% for Reform UK and 13% for the Conservatives.

So it's Lib Dem strength all the way here: but the circumstances of this by-election are slightly embarrassing for the party.  Charlott Saunders, who was first elected in 2023 and was in her first term on the council, was disqualified in October for not turning up to any council meetings in six months.

Defending for the Lib Dems is Callum Robertson, a teacher and teacher trainign lecturer who sits on the party's federal executive committee and is a former chair of the Young Liberals: Robertson was the Lib Dem candidate for Clacton at the 2019 general election, and he has previously sought election at council level in Peterborough, for Essex county council and now in Watford.  In May Robertson unsuccessfully stood in a by-election in Holywell ward, for the seat on Watford council which had been left behind by Labour MP Matt Turmaine.  Labour have selected former Watford councillor Seamus Williams, who served for Callowland ward from 2014 to 2016 and has since been a regular candidate in Watford local elections: Williams has previously stood in Tudor ward at the 2019 by-election and in 2021.  The Conservative candidate is Danny Mosley, a care-home worker who stood in North Watford division in May's county elections.  Reform UK's Mark Dixon was runner-up in Meriden Tudor in May and is hoping to go one better this time; he completes the ballot along with the Green Party's Dave Dunckley.

<h2>Exmouth Halsdon</h2>

East Devon council; casued by the death of Liberal Democrat councillor Andrew Toye.

Today's next by-election is the first part of a two-part episode.  There are currently two vacant seats on East Devon council, and they have been scheduled for consecutive weeks.  So Andrew's Previews will be back in the district next week to cover another by-election in Seaton ward.

Before then we are in East Devon district's largest town.  Exmouth was originally a port located (surprisingly enough) at the mouth of the Exe estuary, but it grew into a large town in the Victorian era as a seaside resort.  Those arriving into Exmouth from land will probably travel along the road or the railway line from Exeter, and Halsdon ward is the first part of Exmouth which those travellers will see.

The boundaries of Halsdon ward include one of the UK's more eccentric houses.  A la Ronde was built in 1796 for two wealthy spinsters, Jane and Mary Parminter, to an unusual 16-sided design.  The house's interior decoration includes various souvenirs of the Parminters' European travels together with the unique Shell Gallery, whose walls are decorated with tens of thousands of seashells.  The house is now in the hands of the National Trust which has opened most of it to the public, although the Shell Gallery is too fragile for public display.

Halsdon is the north-western of Exmouth's five wards and it returns three members of East Devon council.  It had a full slate of Conservative councillors until 2015, when the Tories lost a seat to East Devon Independent Alliance candidate Megan Armstrong.  Armstrong was re-elected at the top of the poll in 2019 as the Conservatives lost the ward's other two seats to another indepndent and a Green Party candidate.  None of the outgoing councillors sought re-election here in 2023, when a rather curious result gave 40% and two seats to the Liberal Democrats, 30% and one seat to Labour, and 30% to the Conservatives.  The curious bit is that none of the three parties had put up a full slate of three candidates.

East Devon council has been under no overall control since 2019.  The 2023 election here returned 19 independent councillors, 18 Lib Dems, 17 Conservatives, 3 Labour councillors, 2 Greens and a single candidate from the continuing Liberal Party.  None of the three Labour councillors wlected in 2023 are still in the party: one of them has joined the Lib Dems and the other two - including Exmouth Halsdon ward councillor Daniel Wilson - have gone independent.  A coalition of the Liberal Democrats, the Green Party and some of the independent councillors is in control.

Exmouth was added to the Parliamentary map in 2024 with the creation of the Exmouth and Exeter East constituency.  This was the main successor to the old East Devon constituency, but East Devon's Conservative MP Simon Jupp decided instead to seek re-election in Honiton.  If this was an attempted chicken run, it spectacularly failed: not only did Jupp lose to the Lib Dems in Honiton, but the Conservatives' David Reed went on to win the seat that Jupp had left behind.  Reed, who won by 121 votes on a freak vote split, is a good fit for the seat: he had previously been in the Royal Marines, based out of the Lympstone commando training centre just to the north of Exmouth.

Another freak vote split produced a very fragmented result in the two-seat Exmouth division at the 2025 county election.  Shares of the vote here were 25% for Reform UK, 22% for the Conservatives, 20% for the Lib Dems, 16% for ex-Labour district councillor Daniel Wilson standing as an independent candidate, and 10% for the Green Party.  Reform UK gained one seat from the Cosnervatives, who held the other.

As can be seen, a large number of parties have some sort of track record in Exmouth Halsdon.  Perhps we might get a similarly fragmented result in this by-election, which has been a rather long time coming after Liberal Democrat councillor Andrew Toye passed away at the end of August.  Toye had been a councillor on and off for some years, having served this ward since 2023 and previously representing Exmouth Brixington ward from 2003 to 2007.

Defending this seat for the Lib Dems is Fran McElhone, who is a freelance journalist.  Labour, who ran second here in 2023 and won one out of three seats, now appear to be in such disarray in East Devon that they haven't found a candidate for this by-election.  The Conservatives are on the ballot paper with their candidate Paula Burtoft, who has spent her career in the health and social care sector as a qualified nurse and care home manager.  Also on the ballot are Tony Quinn for Reform UK and the Green Party's Tony Woodward, who was previously elected as a councillor for this ward in 2019 and is now trying to get his seat back after retiring in 2023,

<h2>Winkleigh</h2>

Torridge council, Devon; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Simon Newton.

Our final by-election is also in Devon, but this time in a rural ward.  The village nnd post town of Winkleigh lies on high ground in between two valleys, the Torridge valley to the west and the Taw to the east.  It has a current electorate of 1,432, but the population here was much bigger during the Second World War when the former RAF Winkleigh airfield hosted a large number of airmen from all over the world.  Two squadrons of the Royal Canadian Air Force were deployed here, and Winkleigh was also a major training base for the Royal Norwegian Air Force in the final years of the war.

Winkleigh ward also includes the far-flung parish of Ashreigney to the north.  This ia a corner of Devon which has been dominated by agriculture since time immemorial, and Winkleigh ward makes the top 100 in England and Wales for residents employed in that sector (13.0%).  Perhaps the most high-profile export from the area was the ASBO fuel known as White Lightning cider, which was made here by Inch's Cider when it launched in 1990; but Inch's were then bought out by Bulmer's, who moved production to Hereford before White Lightning was discontinued in 2009.  One local farmer who wasn't involved in the cider business was the former Poet Laureate Ted Hughes, who had a farm here called Moortown for many years until his death in 1998.  Hughes used the name <em>Moortown</em> as a title for a poetry collection.

This remote area of Devon is administerd from Bideford, 17 miles to the north-west, as part of Torridge council.  This is a hung council which is currently run as a minority by the independent group, after the 2023 election returned 16 independent councillors, 8 Lib Dems, 6 Conservatives, 4 Greens and 2 Labour.

Since 2023 the Liberal Democrats have gained three Torridge council seats in by-elections, and they might fancy their chances of a fourth gain here.  Winkleigh ward has voted Conservative since 2015, and both the 2019 and 2023 contests here were fought between the Conservatives' Simon Newton and the Lib Dems' Stephen Middleton.  Newton won in 2023 with a 49-34 margin, which was a slight swing in his favour from 2019.  Winkleigh's position in a corner of Torridge district meant that it survived a 2019 boundary review unchanged.

The Liberal Democrats did well here in May's county elections, in which they convincingly gained the local county division of Torrington Rural from the Conservatives.  However, the high-earning former Attorney General Sir Geoffrey Cox has been in situ as the local MP for over twenty years now, having been re-elected for his sixth term of office last year in the Torridge and Tavistock constituency.

As stated, the Conservatives are defending this by-election following the resignation in October of Simon Newton, who had served the ward since 2019.  Newton is a former senior Army officer who rose to become commanding officer of the 1st Battalion Duke of Wellington's Regiment, with the rank of lieutenant-colonel, and he was appointed MBE in the 1995 Birthday Honours for his military service.  Since leaving the Army Newton has had a number of roles in the defence and leisure sector alongside running a farm in the Winkleigh area and, of course, his former democratic duties.

The Conservatives are hoping to pass this seat on to the next generation by selecting Benjamin Roth, who is a Winkleigh parish councillor.  The Liberal Democrats have again selected Stephen Middleton, a farmer and Ashreigney parish councillor who is contesting this seat for the third time.  Completing the ballot here is another Ashreigney resident, Reform UK's Michael Jarvis who is standing in his first election.
