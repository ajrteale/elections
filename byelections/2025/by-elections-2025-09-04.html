One by-election on 4th September 2025:

<h2>Stopsley</h2>

Luton council, Bedfordshire; caused by the death of Liberal Democrat councillor David Wynn.

The schools are back for autumn and the traffic is back on the roads.  Autumn is traditionally a busy time of year for by-elections, but this particular Septemner is going to start off quietly with just one poll taking place today.  And it's one that's not likely to see much excitement, but you never know what might happen in UK politics.

Our single by-election today takes place in Luton.  Stopsley ward covers the suburbs of Stopsley and Putteridge in the north-west corner of the town, along the main road towards Hitchin; for travellers entering Luton along this road, Stopsley ward is the first part of the town they will encounter.  This is mostly 20th-century housing which gets more desirable the further out of Luton you go., with Putteridge in particular having fairly high house prices and coming in among the least-deprived parts of Luton.  Boundary changes for the 2023 election, which added a third councillor to Stopsley ward, brought in a more desprived area along Ashcroft Road to the south which is more typical of Luton as a whole.

The ward boundaries include Stopsley High School, which is designated as a specialist sports college.  It certainly has the former pupils to sugget the school must be doing something right in this regard.  Among the kids to have studied here in the past are Bruce Rioch, who started his football caeer with Luton Town before going on to win 24 caps for Scotland and a League winner's medal with Derby County, and the spin bowler Monty Panesar, who took 167 Test wickets in 50 games for England.  Panesar subsequently had a short-lived foray in politics, announcing in April last year that he would stand in the 2024 general election as a Workers Party of Britain candidate before withdrawing a week later.

The late councillor David Wynn had stuck around in politics for rather longer than that, being first elected to Luton council in 2019 and serving until his unexpected death in June.  He was deputy leader of the Lib Dem group on Luton council.  Before settling in Luton Wynn's career had been in the engineering and computer industry, and he had first got involved in computers in the days when a single computer would take up most of a room while being much less powerful than the device you're probably reading this on.

On expanded boundaries, Wynn was very easily re-elected for his second term in Stopsley ward in 2023 as the Lib Dem slate thrashed Labour by 78-22 in a straight fight.  But Labour won that election in Luton overall with 30 seats against 15 Lib Dems and 3 Conservatives, and the two also has two Labour MPs.  Luton North is represented by Sarah Owen, who chairs the Commons women and equalities committee, while Rachel Hopkins is the MP for Luton South and South Bedfordshire.  The 2024 parliamentary changes moved the previous Stopsley ward from Hopkins' seat into Owen's, a change which has left the redrawn ward divided between the two Luton constituencies.

Defending this seat for the Lib Dems is Matt Fry, a finance manager and business consultant who has held a Luton Town season ticket for over 50 years.  He appears to be fighting his first election campaign as is the Labour candidate, Moazzem Hussain.  This might be one of the safest Lib Dem wards in the land on paper, but this time it won't be a straight Lib Dem versus Labour fight: we also have on an all-male ballot Edward Carpenter for the Green Party, Jim Cohen for Reform UK, Roger Nichols for the Conservatives and independent candidate (and former Green Party figure) Marc Scheimann.
