Ten by-elections on 26th June 2025, Super Thursday:

<h2>Crediton Lawrence</h2>

Mid Devon council; caused by the death of Liberal Democrat councillor Frank Letch.

There's a lot to get through today, so let's dive straight in.  Of the ten seats up for election five are defended by the Labour Party, two by localist parties, one by the Conservatives and two by the Liberal Democrats.  We'll start with those two Lib Dem defences, both of which are in the south of England.

The town of Crediton lies in the interior of Devon, about eight-miles north-west of Exeter on the main road and railway line towards Barnstaple.  Its economy was traditionally based on wool and textiles, but its two electoral wards are named after saints.  Crediton Boniface ward, which covers the town centre and railway station, commemorates St Boniface who is traditionally held to have been born here around 675; he spent his career doing missionary work in what is now Germany and the Netherlands, ending up as archbishop of Mainz, and he is recognised as the patron saint of Germany, Devon, the German city of Fulda (where he is buried) and the Canadian city of Winnipeg.

Boniface was a martyr as was St Lawrence, who has a chapel in western Crediton and the electoral ward covering western Crediton dedicated to him.  Lawrence came from what is now Spain to become Archdeacon of Rome, where he was put to death in 258; the grisly tradition has it that he was roasted to death on a gridiron.  Because of this legend and Lawrence's actions before his death to hide and protect the written documents of the Catholic Church, he is venerated as the patron saint of a number of occupations for which fire is bad news, including miners, the poor, librarians and archivists.

The Local Elections Archive Project run by this particular archivist is yet to get around to including the 2023 Mid Devon council elections.  Sorry, I'm a busy man.  These elections were generally a big win for the Liberal Democrats, who decisively took control of what had previously been a fragmented and unstable hung council.  This built on work done by the party in 2022 to win the parliamentary by-election in Tiverton and Honiton, which covered most of Mid Devon district.

Crediton, however, was not part of that constituency.  It is one of the main towns in the Central Devon constituency, which covers a far-flung area to the west of Exeter stretching west to Okehampton and south to Buckfastleigh.  This seat turned in one of the closest results in the country at the 2024 general election, with the Work and Pensions Secreatry Sir Mel Stride (as he now is) securing re-election for his fifth term of office by just 61 votes over Labour.  He is now the Shadow Chancellor.

Quite where the Labour vote in this seat comes from is something of a mystery, because Labour has little presence here in local elections.  Crediton is a Lib Dem-voting town at lower levels of government, and Lawrence ward (the "Crediton" prefix was added in 2019) has been in the hands of that party since 2007.  In 2023, the only previous contest on the current boundaries, the Lib Dem slate had an easy win with 52% of the vote against 26% for Labour and 22% for the Conservatives.

Since 2015 that Lib Dem slate had included Frank Letch, a Londoner by birth who had retired to Crediton in the 1990s after a career teaching in both English and Welsh; in his spare time Letch was also a dog trainer with a number of Crufts wins to his name.  His disability - he was born without arms - also led to a lot of charity work, and he was appointed MBE in the 2015 New Year Honours for services to people with disabilities and the community in Crediton.  In local government Letch served for 13 years as mayor of Crediton, and he also took over as the town's Devon county councillor in 2021.

Frank Letch died in April at the age of 80, just before his county council term was due to expire.  He wasn't seeking re-election to the county council so the poll went ahead as scheduled on 1st May, and his Lib Dem successor held the Crediton county division with an increased majority.  Gains for the party elsewhere meant that the Lib Dems took minority control of Devon last month.

Having successfully defended Letch's county council seat in May, the Lib Dems now have to do the same trick at Mid Devon council level.  Here their defending candidate is Tim Stanford, who has a long track record of volunteer community work ranging from youth football and Sea Cadets to local radio.  Labour have selected Terence Edwards, a building engineer who comes here hotfoot from the last Mid Devon council by-election in Clare and Shuttern ward last month; Edwards was also a candidate for Devon county council in May, finishing fifth and last in Willand and Uffculme division.  Very surprisingly the Conservatives haven't found anybody prepared to contest a local by-election in the Shadow Chancellor's constituency, so Reform UK's Andy Hankins is the only other candidate here.

<h2>Catsfield and Crowhurst</h2>

Rother council, East Sussex; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Chas Pearce.

Our other Lib Dem defence of the week is in one of those wards that looks like it was the awkward bit left over once everywhere else had been satisfactorily sorted out.  Catsfield and Crowhurst ward covers five parishes stretching in a north-westerly direction from the edge of Hastings all the way to Dallington.

Catsfield is the largest of these parishes by population, with 708 electors on the roll.  Like Crediton in the previous section, its church is dedicated to St Laurence (although with a different spelling of his name).  The source of the village's name is unclear, with suggestions including references to the Germanic Catti tribe, to St Chad of Mercia or to his brother Cedd, who was bishop of London in the 7th century.  Nobody seems to have seriously discussed the possibility that the Catsfield name might in fact mean what it says and be a reference to cats.

Slightly smaller is Crowhurst, which is the ward's railhead.  Crowhurst railway station lies on the line from London to Hastings, with hourly trains in each direction.  Nearby is Fore Wood, a steep-sided wooded valley run as a nature reserve by the RSPB.    Most of this ward lies within the High Weald National Landscape (the newish name for Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty) including the whole of Ashburnham and Dallington parishes; but things were very different in centuries past when this area was a centre of the Weald's ironworking industry, and a blast furnace at Ashburnham was in operation into the 19th century.  Ashburnham parish is named after Ashburnham Place, which was once the country house and estate of the Earls of Ashburnham; the house was mostly demolished in 1959, and the remaining buildings are run by a Christian trust as a conference and prayer centre.

This area between Bexhill to the south and Battle to the north is part of the Bexhill and Battle parliamentary seat, which has been in Conservative hands since its creation in 1983.  Its first MP was Charles Wardle, who fell out with his local party in 2001 after they selected Greg Barker, who was then working for Roman Abramovich's oil firm, as his successor.  Wardle endorsed the UKIP candidate, one Nigel Farage, in the 2001 election; but Farage finished fourth and last with 7.8% of the vote and Barker won easily.  Greg Barker was also challenged in the 2010 election by the spread-betting businessman Stuart Wheeler, who stood for his own Trust party and polled 4.9% - finishing 31 votes short of saving his deposit.  Barker retired to the Lords in 2015 and was replaced by Conservative MP Huw Merriman, who stood down at the 2024 election; at that point Merriman was the junior minister responsible for railways and HS2, and he has continued to build on that work since leaving the Commons as chair of the Liverpool Manchester Railway board.  In 2024 Bexhill and Battle remained in Conservative hands, with new MP Kieran Mullan successfully doing the chicken run from his previous seat of Crewe and Nantwich; Mullan is now on the Conservative frontbench as a shadow justice minister.

The local authority here is Rother council, which covers the countryside surrounding Hastings plus the town of Bexhill-on-Sea.  This has been a hung council since 2019, with the 2023 elections returning 10 Conservatives, 8 members of the Rother Association of Independent Councillors, 8 Labour, 7 Lib Dems, 3 Greens and 2 independents.  An anti-Conservative rainbow coalition is running the show, under a leader from RAOIC.

In the 2023 election Catsfield and Crowhurst ward was gained by the Liberal Democrats' Chas Pearce, who polled 48% against 33% for the previous Conservative councillor Gary Curtis and 19% for Labour.  Most of the ward is part of the Battle and Crowrhust division of East Sussex county council, which also voted Lib Dem when it was last contested in 2021.

So the Lib Dems are defending this by-election, after Chas Pearce resigned last month on health grounds.  Their defending candidate Nicola McLaren is a Battle town councillor.  The Conservatives have selected Joe Carter, a young man who grew up in Catsfield.  Labour's Timothy Macpherson is back for another go after his third- and last-placed finish in 2023; he is a regular candidate in Rother local elections, and he also has a Parliamentary campaign under his belt having been the Labour candidate for East Worthing and Shoreham in 2015.  Reform UK's Bernard Brown, another Battle town councillor, completes the candidate list.

<h2>Wickford Park</h2>

Basildon council, Essex; caused by the death of Wickford Independent councillor David Harrison.

We now travel east from London for the first of today's two by-elections involving localism.  The town of Wickford lies in Essex to the north-east of Basildon new town, on the railway line from London to Southend Victoria; Wickford railway station is also the junction for the Crouch Valley line to Southminster.  The London to Southend railway is the north-eastern boundary of Wickford Park ward, which covers most of the town centre together with housing in the south of the town.

Wickford lost its civic identity in 1934 with the creation of Billericay Urban District, which was renamed as Basildon Urban District in 1955 following the designation of Basildon New Town and became the modern Basildon council in 1974 with minor boundary changes.  Basildon has always been more politically left-wing than Wickford, which safely returned Conservative councillors to Basildon council until 2014.  In that year's Basildon council elections UKIP did very well by winning 11 seats out of a possible 15, including Wickford Park ward which was gained by UKIP candidate David Harrison by 53 votes over the Conservatives.

We can see this in the local government career of the late David Harrison, a very long-serving councillor who had been first elected to the old Basildon Urban District council in 1971 - although his electoral record was by no means continuous.  Harrison had served as chairman of Basildon council in 1986, welcoming Muhammad Ali to the district; many years later he was in the civic chair again with the new title of mayor of Basildon in 2016-18, greeting the Princess of Wales (as she now is) on her visit to the borough.  Such was Harrison's commitment to local government that he turned up to his final overview and scrutiny committee meeting and moved an amendment on car parking despite having suffered a suspected stroke that morning: in the words of the council leader Gavin Callaghan's tribute, "if there's a council in heaven, Dave's already read the agenda."  He passed away in April at the age of 86, following a long period of poor health.

At the first election to the modern Basildon council in 1973 Harrison was elected as a Labour councillor for Central ward, transferring to Fryerns East ward following boundary changes in 1979.  In 1988 he sought re-election as a Social and Liberal Democrats candidate for Wickford North but was not successful; by 1991 he was in the Conservatives and he stood for them in Wickford South ward, without success.  David Harrison next turns up on a Basildon conucil ballot paper in 2004, when he contested Wickford North ward for the Senior Citizens Party; he then performed better in the same ward as an independent candiadte in 2007, 2008, 2011 and 2012 with second-place finishes on all four occasions.  Harrison then finally made it back to Basildon council in 2014 as a UKIP candidate for Wickford Park ward.

By 2016 Wickford's UKIP councillors had all quit the party and formed a localist group called the Wickford Independents (for those who haven't been keeping count, that's David Harrison's sixth political party and seventh ballot paper label), and since then Wickford Park ward has been closely fought between the Wickford Independents and the Conservatives.  Harrison lost his seat here in 2018 as a candidate for the Wickford Independents, got it back in 2019, tried to seek re-election in 2023 in Wickford Castledon ward without success, and then got his seat back here for the second time in 2024.  Wickford Park's ward boundaries were expanded for the 2024 elections with an increase from two councillors to three, and an all-out election gave 32% of the vote to the Wickford Independents slate, 31% to the Conservatives and 23% to the Labour candidate.  The Wickford Independents had only stood two candidates, and they were both elected with the Conservatives winning the other seat.  David Harrison finished in third place 84 votes ahead of the second Conservative candidate, so the winner of this by-election will take over his old seat and will need to seek re-election next May - unless things change before then.

The Wickford Independents have never made much impact in the large Wickford Crouch division of Essex county council, which is normally safe Conservative although UKIP did win one of the two seats here in 2013.  The town is part of the Rayleigh and Wickford parliamentary seat which has been represented since its creation in 2010 by Conservative MP Mark Francois, who is himself a former Basildon councillor; Francois joined the Conservatives' frontbench team last year as a shadow defence minister, following a number of years on the backbenches.

This column will not cover whatever elections David Harrison might be contesting in heaven, but we are qualified to talk about the poll in this world which will elect his successor.  The defending Wickford Independents candidate is Andrew Carter.  The Conservatives' Lewis Hooper is standing for Basildon council for the first time, but he has previous local government experience in Wales as a Conservative member of Rhondda Cynon Taf council from 2017 to 2022 (when he lost re-election in Pontyclun East by one vote).  Labour have selected Wayne Milne, who runs a housing business supporting vulnerable families.  Also standing are Stewart Mott for the Lib Dems, Sarah-Jane Shields for Reform UK and Penny Wright for the Green Party.

<h2>Great Wyrley Landywood</h2>

South Staffordshire council; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Kath Williams.

Our Midlands poll today comes just to the north of the Black Country.  We're in Great Wyrley, whose name was added to the Parliamentary map last year despite the fact that few people could reliably point to its location.  This column is, of course, here to help you with matters like that.

Great Wyrley is a former pit village immediately to the south of Cannock, of which it is effectively a southern extension beyond the M6 Toll motorway, and it lies on the main road and railway line between Cannock and Walsall.  The village is served by Landywood railway station, which was opened on the Chase Line in 1989 and now sees half-hourly electric trains north to Cannock and Rugeley and south to Walsall and Birmingham.  Landywood ward is effectively the southern half of Great Wyrley parish, and it is nearly all residential.

In 1876 a new vicar of St Mark's church in Great Wyrley was appointed: this was Shapurji Edalji, who had been born into a Parsi family in Bombay before converting to Christianity; he may have been the first South Asian to become an English parish priest.  He served the parish until his death in 1888, despite a number of incidents of racial harassment which often took the form of anonymous poison-pen letters and run-ins with the Staffordshire chief constable Captain Anson.  Matters came to a head in 1903 with a series of animal mutilations in the Great Wyrley area, for one of which the vicar's son George Edalji, a solicitor, was prosecuted and served three years' hard labour.  The case against George Edalji was widely thought to be flawed - in 2013 the Solicitor-General went so far as to say that his trial had been a farce - and an investigation by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle led in 1907 to Edalji being pardoned and to the creation of the Court of Criminal Appeal.  This story has been dramatised on a few occasions since, most recently in Julian Barnes' 2005 novel <em>Arthur and George</em> which was nominated for the Booker Prize and was turned into a three-part TV series by ITV in 2015, with Arsher Ali playing Edalji and Martin Clunes as Doyle.

As stated, Great Wyrley joined the parliamentary map in 2024 with the creation of the Stone, Great Wyrley and Penkridge constituency which was clearly the awkward bit of Staffordshire that was left over after everything else had been satisfactorily sorted out.  This was comfortably won in 2024 by Sir Gavin Williamson, the former Cabinet minister and outgoing MP for South Staffordshire, who has never been far away from controversy and his 2024 win was no exception: the seat's Reform UK candidate withdrew and joined the Conservatives with less than an hour to go before the nominations deadline, amid allegations of dirty tricks from the Williamson campaign.  Williamson's 46.5% of the vote was one of the highest Conservative scores in the 2024 election; Stone, Great Wyrley and Penkridge was also the only seat where UKIP saved their deposit or came close to doing so.  Reform UK got their revenge for this in the 2025 Staffordshire elections when they won a large majority on the county council, including comfortably winning the Great Wyrley and Essington county division which covers this ward.

There had been no RUK candidate in the 2023 South Staffordshire council elections, in which the Conservatives narrowly held both seats in Great Wyrley Landywood ward with 40% of the vote against 38% for Labour and 14% for an independent candidate.  The re-elected Conservative councillors Ray Perry and Kath Williams had both served the ward continuously since 2007, when they gained their seats from Labour.  Overall South Staffordshire is one of the few districts which has resisted the massive losses of the last few years and still has a large Conservative council majority.

Great Wyrley Landywood is the only Conservative defence this week, following the resignation of Kath Williams last month.  Defending for the party is Joe Hill, who gives an address in the ward and works to support small- and medium-sized businesses as they face financial challenges.  The Labour candidate Jan Jeffries is a parish councillor in Brewood and Coven some distance away.  The independent from last time has not returned, so completing the ballot paper are Danni Braine for the Greens and Craig Humphreyson, newly-elected Staffordshire county councillor for Penkridge, for Reform UK.

<h2>Stocksbridge and Upper Don</h2>

Sheffield council, South Yorkshire; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Julie Grocutt.

We now come to two wards which lie deep inside Pennine valleys.  On the Yorkshire side the Little Don flows eastwards towards its confluence with the main River Don at Deepcar, in a Peak District valley which wasn't seriously developed until the 19th century.  Indeed, in the mid-18th century pretty much the only thing here was a fulling mill run by a local farmer and landowner called John Stocks.  He threw a wooden footbridge over the Little Don so that his employees living on the north side of the river could get to work without getting their feet wet.  This was the original Stocks' Bridge.
In 1794 Stocks' mill was replaced by a large cotton mill, which was taken over in 1842 by Samuel Fox.  Fox converted the mill to manufacture those essential items for the Great British Summer: umbrellas, which of course require not just fabric but also steel wire.  In 1851 the Fox Umbrella Frames company developed the "Paragon" umbrella frame, a form of U-shaped steel wire which was far better than any competing product on the market.  Paragon frames were quickly being made as fast as possible, not just for umbrellas but also for crinolines.

As Fox' business boomed. his company started to look not just for new products but also more control over its supply chain.  In the early 1860s Fox decided it would cheaper to make his own steel rather than buy it in from elsewhere, and ever since then the bottom of the Little Don valley has been filled with furnaces and mills making high-quality steel - originally for umbrellas and springs, latterly for the aerospace industry.

The modern town of Stocksbridge on the south side of the valley was spawned by the steel mill, and this is reflected in its cultural landmarks.  The local non-league football team Stocksbridge Park Steels, who have recently been promoted to the Northern Premier League Premier Division three levels below the EFL, are descended from the old steelworks works team.  In 2003 Stocksbridge Park Steels took on a 16-year-old who had just been released from Sheffield Wednesday's youth system: whatever happened to that young lad called Jamie Vardy?  This being Yorkshire there was also a brass band: the Stocksbridge Band are heard here performing a Disney medley.  (Following a change in sponsorship, they are now based in Sheffield and known as the Unite the Union Brass Band.)

https://youtu.be/mxwmNyMyesA

The Stocksbridge steelworks are still in production today, but there are dark clouds on the near horizon.  The plant's owners Liberty Steel put the Stocksbridge site up for sale in 2021 but they have failed to find a buyer, and recent reports suggest that the company is in severe financial trouble.  In recent years some spare steelworks land has been redeveloped for retail and office use as the Fox Valley Shopping Park, with a direct link from the A616 bypass.

The Stocksbridge Bypass is part of the only trunk road across the Pennines between Sheffield and Manchester, forming a fast link between the M1 motorway and the Woodhead Pass.  Perhaps too fast: this road is a scaled-down version of plans to build a motorway on the same line, and building it as a single carriageway with climbing lanes has led to the road having an appalling accident record ever since it opened in 1988.  And as if that weren't enough, the Stocksdeath Bypass is also reputed to be haunted.

Before the A616 was built, Manchester to Sheffield traffic originally turned south after Stocksbridge and followed the Don valley south towards the city.  Here can be found the villages of Wharncliffe Side and that pronounciation trap for the non-local, Oughtibridge, both of which are now Sheffield commuter villages.  In April this year the boundary here between Sheffield and Barnsley was adjusted in order to transfer a new housing development at Oughtibridge Mill into the city of Sheffield, and into Stocksbridge and Upper Don ward.

To the west of this is a large expanse of moorland, most of which is within the Peak District National Park.  The lower reaches of this moorland are crisscrossed by tiny country lanes connecting tiny hamlets with wonderful names like Wigtwizzle.  High Stones, a summit of 550 metres, is the ward's highest point.

Stocksbridge was incorporated into Sheffield in 1974, with the present Stocksbridge and Upper Don ward dating from 2004 subject to the above boundary change.  This was a strong Liberal Democrat ward until the Coalition years, when their vote faded away: of the three Lib Dem seats, two went to Labour in 2011 and 2012 with the other being gained by UKIP in 2014.  UKIP went on to gain one of the Labour seats in 2015, and came within three votes of a full slate in 2016, but then their vote fell away here.

The UKIP seats were next up for election in 2019 - gained by Labour's Julie Grocutt - and in 2021 - when the outgoing UKIP councillor stood for re-election as an independent and Stocksbridge and Upper Don ward voted for the Conservatives.  That is the only seat the Conservatives have won on Sheffield city council in the last 20 years.  Labour gained the Conservative seat in May 2024, polling 50% against 28% for the Conservatives and 13% for the Greens.

Stocksbridge entered the Parliamentary map in 2010 with the creation of the Penistone and Stocksbridge constituency.  This has voted Labour at all contests except for a Conservative win in 2019, but the 2010-19 Labour MP Angela Rayner was one of the MPs who formed the short-lived Change UK during the Brexit debates and she eventually ended up in the Lib Dems.  The MP here since 2024 has been Marie Tidball, a disability rights campaigner.

The Labour seat gain from the Conservatives in 2024 still did not give the party a full slate of Stocksbridge and Upper Don ward councillors.  This is because Sheffield Labour had split in 2023, with several councillors being suspended from the party for voting against the Local Plan and subsequently founding the Sheffield Community Councillors Group.  Sheffield council is hung, with the latest composition giving 36 Labour councillors, 27 Lib Dems, 14 Greens, 4 Sheffield Community Councillors and 2 independents plus this vacancy.

One of the Labour councillors who jumped ship was the outgoing councillor here Julie Grocutt, a former South Yorkshire Police officer who had served on Sheffield council since she gained her seat from UKIP in 2019.  Long-term readers of Andrew's Previews may remember that Grocutt had previously been the Labour candidate for a city council by-election in faraway Mosborough ward in September 2016, a seat which she embarrassingly lost to the Lib Dems.

Labour will want their seat back and they have selected Josiah Lenton, who lives in Wharncliffe Side and is a governor at Stocksbridge High School.  The Conservatives' Matt Dixon, who lives in Oughtibridge and was runner-up here last year, is seeking to return to the city council chamber after many years away: he represented Netherthorpe ward from 1999 to 2003, originally as a Lib Dem before he defected to the Conservatives.  The Greens' Andy Davies returns from the 2024 general election in which he contested Penistone and Stocksbridge; he is a teacher and contractor in countryside management.  Also standing are Stuart Shepherd for the Lib Dems, Claire Wraith for the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition, Adam Allcroft for the Yorkshire Party and John Booker, a former UKIP and Brexit Party parliamentary candidate who is seeking to become Sheffield's first elected Reform UK councillor.
