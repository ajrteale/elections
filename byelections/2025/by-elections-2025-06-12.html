One by-election on Wednesday 11th June 2025:

<h2>Severn</h2>

Stroud council, Gloucestershire; caused by the death of Labour councillor Richard Maisey.

Six days ago this column was discussing the Scottish Parliament by-election in the Lanarkshire constituency of Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse.  This week we're off to a different Stonehouse, in Gloucestershire.  Or, more accurately, we're going to the countryside to the west of that Stonehouse.

The Severn ward of Stroud lies in the Severn valley south of Gloucester, at a point where the estuary suddenly meanders a couple of miles to the west, and then comes back again in a horseshoe bend before resuming its journey south-west to the Bristol Channel.  The result of this is that the village of Arlingham is surrounded on three sides by the river, while on the fourth side it is cut off by the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal which cuts the corner for boat traffic.  It's on this canal, rather than the riverbank, that we find the village of Frampton on Severn which claims to have England's village green.

The M5 motorway between Gloucester and Bristol, and the A38 road which it replaced, run through the east part of this ward.  Whitminster lies on the old road, while to the east of the motorway are two villages which are of similar size but very different in character.  Eastington is an old village to the west of Stonehouse which used to have a textile industry; Great Oldbury, by contrast, is a very large and very new housing development on the western edge of Stonehouse which declared independence from Eastington last year and became a parish of its own.  It's already become the largest polling district in Severn ward, with 1,593 electors on the roll, and the new development has caused the ward's electorate to increase by 42% between the 2016 and 2024 elections.

One wonders whether all this new development will have had an effect on Severn ward's elections.  The ward was safely Conservative in both the 2016 and 2021 elections, as was the pre-2016 Severn ward which had rather different boundaries.  But in May 2024 Severn ward's two Conservative councillors both retired and the ward split its two seats: Robert Brown topped the poll with 706 votes and held one of the Conservative seats, but his running-mate Hena Mannan-Rahman was some way behind on 504 votes allowing Labour candidate Richard Maisey to take the second seat with 683 votes.  Topline vote shares were 34% for the Conservatives, 32% for Labour and 18% for the Green Party.  Two months later the Stroud parliamentary seat was gained from the Conservatives by Labour candidate Simon Opher, a GP who had been appointed MBE in 2016 for services to healthcare and patients' wellbeing in Gloucestershire.

The Stroud council elected in May 2024 was hung, with the Green Party finishing top on 22 seats against 20 Labour councillors, 7 Conservatives and 2 Lib Dems.  The Greens formed a minority administration, and they generally did very well in the 2025 elections in Stroud: the party convincingly gained a district council by-election from Labour in Stroud Central ward and they won six of Stroud's eleven county council seats.  But of the county divisions covering Severn ward, the Conservatives managed to hold on to Hardwicke and Severn division while Stonehouse division (which covers Eastington and Great Oldbury) voted narrowly for Reform UK with the Greens a close second.

Stonehouse had previously been represneted by Conservative county councillor Nick Housden, who had been a favourite of <em>Private Eye</em> during his four years in office.  Housden's council term got off to a bad start in 2021, when it was revealed that he had received a two-year suspended prison snetence for blackmail some years previously.  This didn't stop him joining the county council's cabinet with the public health and communities portfoilio, but in April 2023 Housden was charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm against a business partner.  This got him suspended from the Gloucestershire Conservative group pending his trial in December 2023, at which a jury at Cirencester crown court found him not guilty.

Housden was then readmitted to the Conservative whip, but in October 2024 he was suspended from the party again.  What prompted this has never been made clear - the Conservative group's statement at the time referred to "allegations" without going into any more details - but over the last year or so Housden has been the subject of negative publicity over financial and governance issues at the Carlton Club, a private members' club in Stroud which he was chairman of until last year.  Two days before this year's local elections <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1egy3g8nd6o">the BBC carried a report that Housden had been accused of forging signatures</a> to obtain loans totalling Â£150,000 for the club from the Association of Conservative Clubs.  This wasn't exactly helpful to Housden's attempt to seek re-election to the county council as an independent candidate, and he ended up finishing in fourth place in Stonehouse with 14% of the vote.

In the meantime Stroud Labour have troubles of their own, having lost a number of county council seats here in May plus the Stroud Central ward by-election, vacated by former Labour MP David Drew whose resignation statement in February pointed to major infighting in the party.  And the party now have a difficult by-election to defend following the death of Richard Maisey in April at the age of 73.  Maisey, who was a retired solicitor and Eastington parish councillor, had done well to win in a ward which is difficult territory for Labour at the best of times.  These are not the best of times.

Defending the Severn ward by-election for Labour is Karen Linforth, who contested the neighbouring Stonehouse ward in 2024 and stood in Stonehouse at last month's county elections: Linforth is an Eastington parish councillor and USDAW rep.  The Conservatives have reselected their losing candidate from last time Hena Mannan-Rahman, who works in the healthcare industry: she stood in Stroud Central in May both for the county council and in the district coucnil by-election.  The Green Party's Moya Shannon, a former teacher who now works for her family's carpentry company, is also back for another go after standing here in 2021 and 2024.  Also on the ballot are Mike Stayte of the Lib Dems who is another returning candidate from 2024, UKIP's Ben Walker who was last seen on a ballot paper in 2022 at the Tiverton and Honiston by-election, and Reform UK's Jonathan Wren: in May's county elections Wren contested Dursley division, which does not cover this ward.

Four elections on 12th June 2025:

<h2>Higham Ferrers</h2>

North Northamptonshire council; postponed from 1st May following the death of Liberal Democrat candidate John Ratcliffe.

One regular feature of Andrew's Previews which comes up every June is dealing with the unfinished business from the May ordinary elections.  By this I mean polls which had to be postponed after a candidate died during the election campaign.  In this year's local elections this happened in two areas, affecting a total of four seats.

One of this is a new ward which is going to the polls today for the very first time on its current boundaries.  We've come to Higham Ferrers, one of the small towns of eastern Northamptonshire which were traditionally dependent on the boot and shoe industry.  But Higham Ferrers goes back a long way: a castle was built here not long after the Norman conquest, and the name of the town refers to the noble Ferrers family, who became Earls of Derby.  In or around 1364 the town was the birthplace of Henry Chichele, who served for nearly thirty years in the early 15th century as archbishop of Canterbury.  Cihchele founded a college in Higham Ferrers which was named after him; this didn't survive the reformation, but his later foundation of All Souls College (now part of Oxford University) has had more staying power.

In 1558 Higham Ferrers was granted a borough charter by Mary I which entitled it to elect one Member of Parliament - something which was very unusual in those days, when almost all Parliamentary boroughs returned two MPs.  The right to vote in Higham Ferrers was vested in the mayor, aldermen and freeman, of which there were very few making the town a classic rotten borough.  From the eighteenth century onwards Higham Ferrers always returned the candidate nominated by the Marquess of Rockingham or the Earl Fitzwilliam, and the last contested election for the seat was a by-election in 1724 following the death of Thomas Watson-Wentworth of Wentworth Woodhouse: the Wentworthite candidate John Finch defeated Thomas Dacres by 76 votes to 34.  Higham Ferrers was one of the boroughs disenfranchised by the First Reform Act in 1832

In the modern day Higham Ferrers has merged into a single urban area with the larger town of Rushden to the south, while Irthlingborough faces it across the floodplain of the River Nene to the north.  It's part of the North Northamptonshire district, which was created in 2020 as a merger of four previous dsitricts and also took on responsibilities from the bankrupt Northamptonshire county council.  Previously Higham Ferrers had been included in East Northamptonshire district, which was one of the strongest Conservative councils in the land and where Tory candidates were often returned without a contest at election time.

The first North Northamptonshire elections were held using the old county divisions as ward boundaries, and this column covered the old Higham Ferrers county division at by-election in February 2018 which was safely Conservative.  In 2021 the Tories won all three seats here with 44% of the vote, a big lead over an independent slate on 17% and Labour on 15%.  Boundary changes mean that this Higham Ferrers division is smaller than the old one, with a large chunk of Rushden town removed from the seat and the number of councillors cut from three to two.

But the Tory grasp here is slipping.  Higham Ferrers is part of the Wellingborough and Rushden parliamentary seat, which (under its previous name of Wellingborough) was gained by Labour candidate Genevieve Kitchen at a by-election in February 2024 following the recall of Peter Bone.  Kitchen was re-elected at the general election five months later, and she is now an assistant Labour whip.

The May 2025 elections then saw Reform UK take overall control of North Northamptonshire council from nowhere.  With the two seats in Higham Ferrers to come, Reform UK have 39 seats against just 13 Conservatives, 8 Greens, 4 Labour, 1 Lib Dem and 1 independent.

Higham Ferrers did not poll on 1st May because the ward's Liberal Democrat candidate, John Ratcliffe, had died during the election campaign.  In England this causes the election to be stopped ("countermanded" is the rather old-fashioned word used in the legislation) and a new poll must be held within 35 days of the original date.  Part of the reason for the delay is to allow nominations to reopen and new candidates to stand, but candidates from the original election automatically have their nominations transferred over to the new poll.

Of the three outgoing Conservative councillors for the old, larger Higham Ferrers ward, one is seeking re-election: Jennie Bone, ex-wife of the former Conservative MP Peter Bone, is joined on the ballot by her running-mate John Baugh who is a town councillor.  Independent candidate Peter Tomas, who is a former mayor of Higham Ferrers, is back for another go after contesting the 2021 election here, while another independent on the ballot is Jay Connolly.  Labour have a two-woman slate of Zara Cunliffe, who works in the chemicals sector, and Helen Willmott who is a trustee of a local charity for adults with a learning disability.  Standing for the Green Party is Tara Allston, while the Lib Dems have nominated Chris Nelson to replace the late James Ratcliffe.

In the meantime Reform UK have got into a horrible mess with their candidates here.  The original Reform UK slate consisted of Alan Beswick and Mark Haddon, but when nominations reopened Reform UK nominated two new candidates - apparently not realising that Beswick and Haddon were unable to withdraw their nominations as the deadline for doing that was back in March.  This is a problem in the case of Beswick, who has moved to China in the last month apparently for unexpected family reasons.  If Beswick is elected, we may well find another by-election being triggered in short order.

Once Reform UK realised they had overnominated, one of their additional candidates for Higham Ferrers withdrew but the other one didn't, so the party has ended up with three candidates chasing two seats: Beswick, Haddon and new face Elisa Perna.  Perna had already stood in the 2025 North Northamptonshire council elections as an unsuccessful candidate for Oundle ward, where she lives, and her nomination has set up a different row as to whether she is entitled to stand in this postponed poll.  The returning officer has ruled that she is eligible and the election will go ahead on that basis; but the Liberal Democrats have got a statement out of the Electoral Commission saying otherwise.  This is one of those cases where the law is not clear, but for what it's worth this column agrees with the returning officer on this one: there are plenty of previous cases in the archives of Andrew's Previews where candidates had stood in a postponed poll after standing elsewhere in the ordinary election.  If Perna is elected, then it would be up to the Lib Dem candidate (or four electors) to lodge a petition with the Election Court if they want to take that matter further.  Anyway, the three Reform UK candidate complete a ballot paper of 11.
