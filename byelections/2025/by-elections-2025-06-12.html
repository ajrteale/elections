One by-election on Wednesday 11th June 2025:
</p><p>
<h2>Severn</h2>
</p><p>
Stroud council, Gloucestershire; caused by the death of Labour councillor Richard Maisey.
</p><p>
Six days ago this column was discussing the Scottish Parliament by-election in the Lanarkshire constituency of Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse.  This week we're off to a different Stonehouse, in Gloucestershire.  Or, more accurately, we're going to the countryside to the west of that Stonehouse.
</p><p>
The Severn ward of Stroud lies in the Severn valley south of Gloucester, at a point where the estuary suddenly meanders a couple of miles to the west, and then comes back again in a horseshoe bend before resuming its journey south-west to the Bristol Channel.  The result of this is that the village of Arlingham is surrounded on three sides by the river, while on the fourth side it is cut off by the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal which cuts the corner for boat traffic.  It's on this canal, rather than the riverbank, that we find the village of Frampton on Severn which claims to have England's village green.
</p><p>
The M5 motorway between Gloucester and Bristol, and the A38 road which it replaced, run through the east part of this ward.  Whitminster lies on the old road, while to the east of the motorway are two villages which are of similar size but very different in character.  Eastington is an old village to the west of Stonehouse which used to have a textile industry; Great Oldbury, by contrast, is a very large and very new housing development on the western edge of Stonehouse which declared independence from Eastington last year and became a parish of its own.  It's already become the largest polling district in Severn ward, with 1,593 electors on the roll, and the new development has caused the ward's electorate to increase by 42% between the 2016 and 2024 elections.
</p><p>
One wonders whether all this new development will have had an effect on Severn ward's elections.  The ward was safely Conservative in both the 2016 and 2021 elections, as was the pre-2016 Severn ward which had rather different boundaries.  But in May 2024 Severn ward's two Conservative councillors both retired and the ward split its two seats: Robert Brown topped the poll with 706 votes and held one of the Conservative seats, but his running-mate Hena Mannan-Rahman was some way behind on 504 votes allowing Labour candidate Richard Maisey to take the second seat with 683 votes.  Topline vote shares were 34% for the Conservatives, 32% for Labour and 18% for the Green Party.  Two months later the Stroud parliamentary seat was gained from the Conservatives by Labour candidate Simon Opher, a GP who had been appointed MBE in 2016 for services to healthcare and patients' wellbeing in Gloucestershire.
</p><p>
The Stroud council elected in May 2024 was hung, with the Green Party finishing top on 22 seats against 20 Labour councillors, 7 Conservatives and 2 Lib Dems.  The Greens formed a minority administration, and they generally did very well in the 2025 elections in Stroud: the party convincingly gained a district council by-election from Labour in Stroud Central ward and they won six of Stroud's eleven county council seats.  But of the county divisions covering Severn ward, the Conservatives managed to hold on to Hardwicke and Severn division while Stonehouse division (which covers Eastington and Great Oldbury) voted narrowly for Reform UK with the Greens a close second.
</p><p>
Stonehouse had previously been represneted by Conservative county councillor Nick Housden, who had been a favourite of <em>Private Eye</em> during his four years in office.  Housden's council term got off to a bad start in 2021, when it was revealed that he had received a two-year suspended prison snetence for blackmail some years previously.  This didn't stop him joining the county council's cabinet with the public health and communities portfoilio, but in April 2023 Housden was charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm against a business partner.  This got him suspended from the Gloucestershire Conservative group pending his trial in December 2023, at which a jury at Cirencester crown court found him not guilty.
</p><p>
Housden was then readmitted to the Conservative whip, but in October 2024 he was suspended from the party again.  What prompted this has never been made clear - the Conservative group's statement at the time referred to "allegations" without going into any more details - but over the last year or so Housden has been the subject of negative publicity over financial and governance issues at the Carlton Club, a private members' club in Stroud which he was chairman of until last year.  Two days before this year's local elections <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1egy3g8nd6o">the BBC carried a report that Housden had been accused of forging signatures</a> to obtain loans totalling Â£150,000 for the club from the Association of Conservative Clubs.  This wasn't exactly helpful to Housden's attempt to seek re-election to the county council as an independent candidate, and he ended up finishing in fourth place in Stonehouse with 14% of the vote.
</p><p>
In the meantime Stroud Labour have troubles of their own, having lost a number of county council seats here in May plus the Stroud Central ward by-election, vacated by former Labour MP David Drew whose resignation statement in February pointed to major infighting in the party.  And the party now have a difficult by-election to defend following the death of Richard Maisey in April at the age of 73.  Maisey, who was a retired solicitor and Eastington parish councillor, had done well to win in a ward which is difficult territory for Labour at the best of times.  These are not the best of times.
</p><p>
Defending the Severn ward by-election for Labour is Karen Linforth, who contested the neighbouring Stonehouse ward in 2024 and stood in Stonehouse at last month's county elections: Linforth is an Eastington parish councillor and USDAW rep.  The Conservatives have reselected their losing candidate from last time Hena Mannan-Rahman, who works in the healthcare industry: she stood in Stroud Central in May both for the county council and in the district coucnil by-election.  The Green Party's Moya Shannon, a former teacher who now works for her family's carpentry company, is also back for another go after standing here in 2021 and 2024.  Also on the ballot are Mike Stayte of the Lib Dems who is another returning candidate from 2024, UKIP's Ben Walker who was last seen on a ballot paper in 2022 at the Tiverton and Honiston by-election, and Reform UK's Jonathan Wren: in May's county elections Wren contested Dursley division, which does not cover this ward.

Four elections, for six seats, are taking place on 12th June 2025:
</p><p>
<h2>Higham Ferrers</h2>
</p><p>
<em>North Northamptonshire council; postponed from 1st May following the death of Liberal Democrat candidate John Ratcliffe.</em>
</p><p>
One regular feature of Andrew's Previews which comes up every June is dealing with the unfinished business from the May ordinary elections.  By this I mean polls which had to be postponed after a candidate died during the election campaign.  In this year's local elections this happened in two wards, affecting a total of four seats.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/n-northants-higham-ferrers-2025.png" alt="N Northants, Higham Ferrers" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
One of these is a brand-new ward which is going to the polls today for the very first time on its current boundaries.  We've come to Higham Ferrers, one of the small towns of eastern Northamptonshire which were traditionally dependent on the boot and shoe industry.  But Higham Ferrers goes back a long way: a castle was built here not long after the Norman conquest, and the name of the town refers to the noble Ferrers family who became Earls of Derby.  In or around 1364 the town was the birthplace of Henry Chichele, who served for nearly thirty years in the early 15th century as archbishop of Canterbury.  Chichele founded a college in Higham Ferrers which was named after him; this didn't survive the Reformation, but his later foundation of All Souls College (now part of Oxford University) has had more staying power.
</p><p>
In 1558 Higham Ferrers was granted a borough charter by Mary I which entitled it to elect one Member of Parliament - something which was very unusual in those days, when almost all Parliamentary boroughs returned two MPs.  The right to vote in Higham Ferrers was vested in the mayor, aldermen and freeman, of which there were very few making the town a classic rotten borough.  From the eighteenth century onwards Higham Ferrers always returned the candidate nominated by the Marquess of Rockingham or the Earl Fitzwilliam, and the last contested election for the seat was a by-election in 1724 following the death of Thomas Watson-Wentworth of Wentworth Woodhouse: the Wentworthite candidate John Finch defeated Thomas Dacres by 76 votes to 34.  Higham Ferrers was one of the many small boroughs disenfranchised by the First Reform Act in 1832.
</p><p>
In the modern day Higham Ferrers has merged into a single urban area with the larger town of Rushden to the south, while Irthlingborough faces it across the floodplain of the River Nene to the north.  It's part of the North Northamptonshire district, which was created in 2020 as a merger of four previous districts and also took on responsibilities from the bankrupt Northamptonshire county council.  Previously Higham Ferrers had been included in East Northamptonshire district, which was one of the strongest Conservative councils in the country and where Tory candidates were often returned without a contest at local election time.
</p><p>
The first North Northamptonshire elections in 2021 were held using the old county divisions as ward boundaries, and this column covered the old Higham Ferrers county division at by-election in February 2018 which was safely Conservative.  In 2021 the Tories won all three seats here with 44% of the vote, a big lead over an independent slate on 17% and Labour on 15%.  Boundary changes mean that this Higham Ferrers division is smaller than the old one, with a large chunk of Rushden town removed from the seat and the number of councillors cut from three to two.
</p><p>
But the Tory grasp here is slipping.  Higham Ferrers is part of the Wellingborough and Rushden parliamentary seat, which (under its previous name of Wellingborough) was gained by Labour candidate Genevieve Kitchen at a by-election in February 2024 following the recall of Peter Bone.  Gen Kitchen was re-elected at the general election five months later, and she is now an assistant Labour whip.
</p><p>
The May 2025 elections then saw Reform UK take overall control of North Northamptonshire council from nowhere.  With the two seats in Higham Ferrers to come, Reform UK have 39 seats against just 13 Conservatives, 8 Greens, 4 Labour, 1 Lib Dem and 1 independent.
</p><p>
Higham Ferrers did not poll on 1st May because the ward's Liberal Democrat candidate, John Ratcliffe, had died during the election campaign.  In England this causes the election to be stopped ("countermanded" is the rather old-fashioned word used in the legislation) and a new poll must be held within 35 days of the original date.  Part of the reason for the delay is to allow nominations to reopen and new candidates to stand, but candidates from the original election automatically have their nominations transferred over to the new poll.
</p><p>
Of the three outgoing Conservative councillors for the old, larger Higham Ferrers ward, one is seeking re-election: that's Jennie Bone, ex-wife of the former Conservative MP Peter Bone, who is joined on the ballot by her running-mate John Baugh who is a Higham Ferrers town councillor.  Independent candidate Peter Tomas, who is a former mayor of Higham Ferrers, is back for another go after contesting the 2021 election here, while another independent on the ballot is Jay Connolly.  Labour have a two-woman slate of Zara Cunliffe, who works in the chemicals sector, and Helen Willmott who is a trustee of a local charity for adults with a learning disability.  Standing for the Green Party are Tara Allston and Gerald Kelly, while the Lib Dems have nominated Chris Nelson to replace the late James Ratcliffe.
</p><p>
Which leaves Reform UK, who have got into a horrible mess with their candidates here.  The original Reform UK slate consisted of Alan Beswick and Mark Haddon, but when the poll was postponed this created a problem for Beswick.  He has moved to China in the last month, apparently for unexpected family reasons.  By Reform UK's account, Beswick had intended to withdraw from the postponed poll but he was unable to get the necessary paperwork signed in time due to being out of the country.  If he is elected, we may well find another by-election being triggered here in short order.
</p><p>
What elevates this sequence of events into farce is that Reform UK had nominated <em>two</em> new candidates for the postponed poll, and only one of them has withdrawn.  This means that the party has ended up with three candidates chasing just two seats: Beswick, Haddon and new face Elisa Perna.  Perna had already stood in the 2025 North Northamptonshire council elections as an unsuccessful candidate for Oundle ward, where she lives, and her nomination has set up a different row as to whether she is entitled to stand in this postponed poll having already stood and lost in the same North Northamptonshire ordinary council election.  The returning officer has ruled that she is eligible and the election will go ahead on that basis; but the Liberal Democrats have got a statement out of the Electoral Commission saying otherwise and they took account of that advice when they selected their replacement candidate.
</p><p>
There are plenty of previous occasions in the archives of Andrew's Previews where candidates had turned up in a postponed poll after standing and losing elsewhere in the ordinary election: usually at least one person a year does this.  The most recent case of a candidate in this situation actually winning appears to be in 2019, when Stephen Thurlbourn was elected as a Conservative councillor in South Ribble at a postponed poll for Farington West ward, having already stood and lost in Seven Stars ward at the same ordinary election.  With respect to the conflicting legal advice, this is one of those occasions where the law is not at all clear but for what it's worth (which is probably not much) this column agrees with the returning officer's view that Perna is eligible to stand.  If she is elected, then it would be up to the Lib Dem candidate (or four electors) to lodge a petition with the Election Court if they want to take that matter further based on the Electoral Commission's statement.  Anyway, the three Reform UK candidates complete a ballot paper of 12.

<h2>Haughley, Stowupland and Wetherden</h2>
</p><p>
<em>Mid Suffolk council; caused by the death of Green Party councillor Rachel Eburne.</em>
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/m-suffolk-haughley-stowupland-wetherden-2025.png" alt="M Suffolk, Haughley/Stowupland/Wetherden" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Our rural by-election today is in East Anglia, with a ward of five Suffolk parishes to the north of Stowmarket.  Despite the order of the ward name the largest of these is Stowupland, located just outside that town with 2,211 electors on the roll.  Stowupland is a bit of a dormitory centre, while Haughley has more history as a mediaeval market town (although the market here is long since defunct).  Haughley Castle is a mediaeval motte-and-bailey structure, built in the late 11th century and rebuilt after being destroyed in the 1173 revolt of Henry II's sons.  Wetherden, at the western end of the ward, was the childhood home of the composer Sir Michael Tippett.  All of these villages lie just to the north of the A14, the main east-west trunk road through Suffolk; this dual carriageway once had a series of sharp bands at Haughley with a poor accident record, but these were eliminated in 2008 when the main road was diverted onto a new and straighter alignment to the south.
</p><p>
This might look like Tory-voting countryside, but that hasn't been the case for a very long time now.  In fact Haughley, Wetherden and Stowupland is now represented by the Green Party at all levels of government.  The Greens have had a presence here in central Suffolk for a very long time, with the Mendlesham ward of Mid Suffolk having been in Green hands continuously since 2003.  In 2009 the party gained the Upper Gipping county council division, which includes Mendlesham, Haughley and Wetherden, and early the following year the Haughley and Wetherden seat on Mid Suffolk council became vacant following the resignation of Conservative councillor Bruce Cameron-Laker.  The Green Party went for the resulting by-election in March 2010, and Rachel Eburne gained the seat from the Conservatives by the massive margin of 61-24 on an enormous swing.
</p><p>
After that experience no party was prepared to take Eburne on, and she was re-elected unopposed in the 2011 and 2015 Mid Suffolk elections.  Boundary changes for the 2019 election created the larger ward of Haughley, Stowupland and Wetherden with two councillors; this has overwhelmingly voted Green at both elections to date, with Eburne and her ward colleague Janet Pearson defeating a single Conservative candidate in 2023 by 77-23.  In 2023 Mid Suffolk became the first district council ever to return an overall majority of Green Party councillors, and Eburne became the council's deputy leader with the finance portfolio.  She still held those roles until shortly before she died in March from bone marrow cancer.
</p><p>
The Green Party takeover of this area is now complete.  In the 2021 Suffolk county elections the Greens gained the Stowmarket North and Stowupland county division, while in 2024 this ward was included within the Waveney Valley parliamentary seat which returned the Green Party's co-leader Adrian Ramsay to Parliament as one of four Green MPs.
</p><p>
Given the voting history of this area the defending Green candidate Agnes Watson, a long-standing NHS professional, has to be a strong favourite in this by-election.  The Conservatives have selected Kieren Clayton who contested Combs Ford ward in Stowmarket town in 2023: he is a Stowmarket town councillor who works in the cosmetics industry.  This time there will not be a straight fight, with Timothy Glenton intervening for the Liberal Democrats to give a ballot paper of three candidates.

<h2>Mansfield North</h2>
</p><p>
<em>Nottinghamshire county council; postponed from 1st May following the death of Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition candidate Karen Seymour.</em>
</p><p>
Our second piece of unfinished business from May comes in Mansfield. This local government district elects nine members of Nottinghamshire county council, one for the town of Warsop to the north and the other eight for Mansfield's urban area which is divided into four two-seat county divisions.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/notts-cc-mansfield-n-2025.png" alt="Notts CC, Mansfield N" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Mansfield North division takes in part of the town centre, but it is based on Mansfield Woodhouse which was once an independent town but is now a Mansfield suburb.  As with many towns in this part of Nottinghamshire this was a coal-mining area, and Sherwood Colliery was in operation here up to 1992.  The pithead site has been redeveloped for housing, but the colliery name lives on thanks to a non-league football team (who were relegated from the Northern Premier League this season); the colliery swimming baths are now run by the council as the Rebecca Adlington Swimming Centre, named after the Olympic gold medallist who leaned to swim here.
</p><p>
The town of Mansfield has a complicated recent electoral history.  The parliamentary seat, which is slightly smaller than the borough, was gained in 2024 by Labour's Steve Yemm who defeated the Conservatives' Ben Bradley.  Bradley had combined his Westminster duties with serving as leader of Nottinghamshire county council, and he was elected in 2021 as a county councillor for Mansfield North (transferring from his previous Hucknall North seat) with a massive personal vote.  Topline figures here were 47% for the Conservatives, 30% for Labour (who had won both seats here in 2017) and 17% for the Mansfield Independent Forum; but Bradley's total of 3,072 votes was so far ahead of his Tory running-mate that Labour's Anne Callaghan managed to hold the division's other seat, polling 1,944 votes to 1,722 for the second Conservative candidate.
</p><p>
Mansfield council elections have been a very different matter.  The borough council uses the elected mayoral system, and mayoral elections here have often been closely fought between Labour and the Mansfield Independent Forum who have traditionally mopped up the town's anti-Labour vote in council elections here.  The independents won all mayoral elections here up to 2019, when Labour's Andy Abrahams gained the mayoralty by just two votes.  He was re-elected for a second term in 2023 very comfortably, polling 45% against 26% for the Conservatives and 23% for the Mansfield Independents, and this time Labour also won an overall majority on Mansfield council to go with the mayoralty.  In the 2023 council elections Labour won every ward in the Mansfield North division except for West Bank ward, which voted Conservative in 2023 but was then gained by Labour at a June 2024 by-election.
</p><p>
Former MP and Mansfield North county councillor Ben Bradley isn't seeking re-election to the county council this year, and his replacement as leader of the council is Reform UK's Mick Barton - a Mansfield councillor and former leader of the Mansfield Independents who had been that party's mayoral candidate in 2023 before defecting to Farage's banner.  Barton has a clear overall majority to work with, as the latest council composition has 39 Reform UK councillors against 17 Conservatives, 4 Labour and 3 localist councillors with 3 vacant seats - the two seats here, plus Newark West where the newly-elected Reform UK councillor immediately handed his resignation in and a by-election is pending.  The Reform UK total includes all of the seven other county council seats in Mansfield, where they picked up the Mansfield Independent vote as well as a number of that party's activists.
</p><p>
This election was supposed to take place on 1st May but it had to be called off following the death of Karen Seymour, who was a regular candidate in the town for the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition.  This most recently included standing in the 2024 general election, in which Seymour polled 123 votes across the Mansfield constituency - a lower return than the 154 votes she got just in Mansfield North at the 2017 county council election.
</p><p>
Without Ben Bradley's personal vote the Conservatives are going to struggle to hold their seat here.  Their candidates are Tim Bower, who is a businessman, and Amy Clements who is an early years practitioner in training.  On the Labour side, county councillor Anne Callaghan is seeking re-election for a second term and she is joined by Mansfield's elected mayor Andy Abrahams, who will always have the benefit of being top of the alphabetical ballot paper.  This time there is no Mansfield Independent slate so quite a lot of votes are up for grabs, and Reform UK will hope to pick them up as they have already done in the town's other county divisions: Reform UK candidate David Smith is a former Mansfield Independent Forum councillor (representing Woodlands ward from 2019 to 2023), and his running-mate Gaynor Mann is a former police community support officer.  Chris Clarke is the single Green Party candidate, while the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition have nominated two candidates to replace the late Karen Seymour: they are Milo Tooley-Okonkwo who stood here in 2021 and his brother Otis Tooley-Okonkwo.  Mansfield may be the birthplace of the Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey, but his party do not appear to be organised in the town and they are not on the ballot here.

<h2>Morley South</h2>
</p><p>
<em>Leeds council, West Yorkshire; caused by the resignation of Morley Borough Independents councillor Winifred Kidger.</em>
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/leeds-morley-s-2025.png" alt="Leeds, Morley S" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
We'll finish for the week in the land of the White Rose, up on a hill overlooking Leeds from the south.  Here we find Morley, which at the time of the Domesday survey in 1086 was the centre of one of Yorkshire's wapentakes (equivalent to the ancient hundreds in other counties); the Morley wapentake covered a large chunk of the West Riding, including what is now Bradford.  It's fair to say that other towns in the area have outgrown it, but Morley remains a proud town in its own right with its own industrial history in coal and shoddy (the textile, that is).  Morley successfully fought off an attempt by Leeds to annex the town in 1921, and in 1937 the borough went on an expansion drive of its own by swallowing up four small neighbouring urban districts.  One of those, West Ardsley, now forms part of Morley South ward.

Morley's fine town hall was officially opened in 1895 by the future Prime Minister Herbert Asquith, who was himself a Morley man by birth.  It's now the home of Morley town council, five of whose seven electoral wards combine to form the Morley South ward of Leeds city council.

</p><p>
I was always told that my surname "Teale" is a Yorkshire name. and one branch of the Teale family was once prominent in local politics in Morley.  Geoffrey Teale (no relation, as far as I am aware) was one of the prime movers behind the establishment of the modern Morley town council in April 2000, and he is seen here in a picture from 1999 (on the left) with a petition from locals to that effect.  He was killed in a road accident a few years later, after which the town council named one of Morley's electoral wards after him.  Teale ward, which covers the western end of the town, was subsequently represented for some years by Geoff's widow Amy Teale until she died in 2010.

</p><p>
The boundaries of Teale ward include Scatcherd Park, whose name links to another prominent local political family.  Alice Scatcherd, whose home (now occupied by a funeral director's) still overlooks the park today, was a prominent Yorkshire suffragist who was one of the founders of the Women's Franchise League in 1889; her husband Oliver was a solicitor who served as mayor of Morley in 1898-1900.  Neither of them lived to see women's suffrage, as Oliver died in 1905 and Alice passed away the following year.  Scatcherd Park was a gift to the town from her estate.

Other sons and daughters of Morley have become well-known on the national stage.  Beryl Burton, a seven-time cycling world champion who dominated women's cycling in Britain for decades, lived here all her life.  And Andrew's Previews must of course mention one Ernest Wiseman, who was born in Leeds in 1925 and grew up in the Morley area before finding fame as one half of Morecambe and Wise.  Ernie Wise is commemorated in Morley by a statue, unveiled in 2010 by his widow Doreen, which it's fair to say has had a mixed criticial reception.

What do you think of it so far?
</p><p>
The town's location on a hilltop (this is one of the many places which claim to have been built on seven hills) means that Morley's railway station is at the bottom of a deep cutting, next to the northern end of Morley Tunnel which runs for almost two miles under the town.  Morley Tunnel carries frequent mainline trains between Leeds and Manchester, but only local trains stop at Morley station.  The present Morley station is brand-new, having been opened in 2023 as part of the Transpennine route upgrade; the new station, with longer platforms and better facilities, is located 75 metres closer to Leeds than the old one.
</p><p>
The name of Morley has been ever-present on Yorkshire's constituency map since 1885, and a number of famous names have represented the town over the years including the former Labour cabinet ministers Merlyn Rees (who has a street named after him in the town) and Ed Balls.  The latter lost his Morley and Outwood seat in 2015 to the Conservatives' Dame Andrea Jenkyns, who was herself defeated in 2024 by Labour's Mark Sewards in the redrawn seat of Leeds South West and Morley.  Jenkyns has since reinvented herself as the Reform UK mayor of Greater Lincolnshire, with an intention to cut council jobs by 10%.  If she wants expertise on cuts, she could do worse than visit her Labour successor's constituency office in Morley.

</p><p>
The source of the Conservative vote in Andrea Jenkyns' old Morley and Outwood constituency was always something of a mystery, because Jenkyns' old party has been consistently weak in local elections in both Outwood and Morley.  The late Amy Teale was a Labour figure on the town council, and Labour consistently won Morley wards in Leeds council elections until 2003.  But since then Morley's representation on Leeds city council has been dominated by a localist party, the Morley Borough Independents.  Morley South ward has generally voted for the Morley Borough Independents at local elections since 2004, with some exceptions: the BNP won here in 2006 but their councillor lost re-election as an English Democrats candidate in 2010, while Labour won the ward in 2011 and 2015 and held one of the ward's three seats at an all-out election in 2018.  Winning vote shares in this ward have often been low, and at the most recent Leeds elections in 2024 the Morley Borough Independents won Morley South with 38% of the vote against 31% for Labour and 10% for the Conservatives.

In recent months Reform UK have been having a lot of success in areas like Morley which previously had strong votes for independent or localist slates - as we touched on in the previous section with respect to Mansfield - and these lowish vote shares could spell trouble for the Morley Borough Independents.  As could the circumstances of this by-election: the outgoing councillor Wyn Kidger, who had served the ward since 2018, had fallen out with the party and was a "local independent" councillor when she submitted her resignation.  Kidger has endorsed the Liberal Democrat candidate in the by-election to replace her.

Defending for the Morley Borough Independents is Terry Grayshon, who previously represented this ward on Leeds city council from 2004 to 2011 when he lost his seat to Labour; Grayshon is a former town councillor and former mayor of Morley.  Labour have reselected Charlotte Hill after her runner-up performance last year: she is a Morley town councillor representing Central ward.  The Conservatives' Liam Roberts stood in last year's Leeds council elections for Gipton and Harehills ward in eastern Leeds.  Also on the ballot are Chris Bell of the Green Party, Ryan Taylor (a railwayman whose favourite biscuit is chocolate caramel hobnobs) for Reform UK, and Michael Fox for the Liberal Democrats.
