One by-election on Wednesday 8th October 2025:
</p><p>
<h2>Yateley West</h2>
</p><p>
<em>Hart council, Hampshire; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Mark Vernon.</em>
</p><p>
Andrew's Previews has been going in one form or another for over 15 years now, and in that time this column has written full previews of wards in all but two of Great Britain's local government district.  Today is the day that the outstanding figure reduces to one, as we visit the Hampshire district of Hart which hasn't seen a standalone by-election since December 2003 and hasn't had a by-election of any kind since June 2009.  Whatever Hart council are doing in terms of retaining their councillors must be working.
</p><p>
The Hart district is named after the River Hart, which also gave its name to the village of Hartley Wintney in northern Hampshire.  Its main towns are Fleet and Yateley either side of the M3 motorway and the railway line between London and Southampton.  Yateley, which lies close to Hampshire's northern border, is part of the Blackwater Valley conurbation which is quite a large and economically important urban area dominated by the defence industry. This conurbation is appallingly badly treated by England's local government: it's split between the counties of Berkshire, Hampshire and Surrey and between six different local government districts.
</p><p>
In the 2015 and 2019 indices of multiple deprivation, Hart was ranked as England's least-deprived district.  Yateley is a little less upmarket than the rest of the district, but that isn't saying much.  It's slightly off the beaten track, as there is no railway station here and the main A30 road bypasses the town to the south.  The A30 is separated from the town by Blackbushe Airport, a former RAF Second World War airfield which is now primarily used by corporate jets and flying schools.
</p><p>
The 2024 Westminster boundary changes divided Yateley between two seats, by transferring Yateley East ward to the Aldershot constituency.  West ward remained in its previous seat of North East Hampshire, which in 2015 had had the largest Conservative majority in the land at 29,916 votes or 55.4 percentage points.  Despite this, the seat's previous Conservative MP Ranil Jayawardena went down to defeat in the 2024 Tory rout.  North East Hampshire is now a Liberal Democrat seat represented in the Commons by Alex Brewer; before becoming an MP, she had run a charity providing support to children with Down's syndrome and their parents and medical professionals.

</p><p>
That has left the Conservatives representing this area only at county level, after they gained Hartley Wintney and Yateley West from the Lib Dems in 2021; the 2025 Hampshire elections were cancelled.  For many years Hart council itself has been in the No Overall Control column, with the latest composition having 11 Lib Dems plus this vacancy, 11 councillors for the Community Campaign (Hart), 9 Conservatives and an independent; however, the Lib Dems and the Community Campaign have for many years now had an electoral and coalition pact in Hart district, and their coalition has a large majority.  This electoral pact means that the Community Campaign do not stand in Yateley West, which has voted Lib Dem at all elections from 2016 onwards: in May 2024 the Liberal Democrats defeated the Conservatives here by 76-24 in a straight fight.
</p><p>
So the Liberal Democrats probably shouldn't be too worried about this by-election following the resignation in August of Mark Vernon, who was first elected in 2023 and has stood down just over halfway through his first term of office.  Defending for the Lib Dems is Alex Drage, who is a Yateley town councillor and has previously served on Hart council: he represented Blackwater and Hawley ward from 2018 to 2022 when he stood down.  The Conservatives have selected Sandra Miller, who is a parish councillor in the neighbouring parish of Eversley.  Only three candidates are standing here, with Reform UK's Clive Lawrance completing today's ballot; sadly, the Official Monster Raving Loony Party leader Howling Laud Hope, who lives in Hart district, is not having a go.  Quite why this poll has been scheduled for a Wednesday I'm not sure, but for by-elections the normal Thursday date is only a tradition: under the rules, any working day will do.
