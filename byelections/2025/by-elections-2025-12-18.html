That completes the ordinary business of Andrew's Previews for the year.  But never fear!  It's Christmas, and we have a ghost story to bring you as we tell the tale of the by-election that never was...

<h2>CHRISTMAS BONUS TRACK:<br>
Bare</h2>

Lancaster council; caused by the disqualification of Kate Knight.

<!-- more text here -->

On 29th October, Bare ward's Conservative councillor Kate Knight was declared to be disqualified for failing to turn up to any meetings of the council in six months.  Knight spoke to the local press at the time saying "Unfortunately, in the last 12 months I've had a massive change in personal circumstances which has made it almost impossible to attend meetings".  The returning officer fixed a date of 11th December for the resulting by-election, polling stations were booked and candidate nominations were opened.

But then, on 5th November, it all fell apart.  New information came to light showing that Kate Knight was not in fact disqualified - which presumably means that the minutes of a meeting were found that showed she <em>had</em> in fact attended a council meeting within the previous six months.  The Bare by-election was called off, Knight was fully reinstated as a councillor, and we can assume that someone in Lancaster council's democratic services team has had a stern talking-to.

<h2>Review of the Year</h2>

<blockquote>
"The same procedure as last year, Miss Sophie?"

With Christmas Day this year falling on a Thursday, that really is that for the electoral year of 2025.  It's been a relentless year for this column.  The forthcoming Christmas and New Year break finally ends an unbroken sequence of weekly Thursday columns going all the way back to the 6th February, so readers have been unusually spoiled this year.

In the meantime the farce of local government reorganisation continues to rumble on.  Your columnist was recently contacted by the Midlands politics correspondent of ITV News for comment on what was going on with the intended bonfire of our local councils, and my answer to that was basically that I have seen too many intended reorganisation schemes fall apart to be confident of what's going to happen on that front.  And cynicism turns out to be correct here as well: seven months on from a whole set of county council elections being postponed by a year in advance of local government reorganisation, only in Surrey do we have a clear plan for this and it would appear that the remaining county elections will be going ahead in 2026 - presumably combined with district council elections, which will give the returning officers involved a whole new series of headaches to deal with.  There was, in fact, no good reason to cancel most of the 2025 county elections and those postponements should not have happened without a clear, settled plan for the future of England's so-called "local" government.

So, what can we look forward to for 2026?

Well, I shall do my very best.  Paying subscribers will get a little Christmas present in their inboxes next Thursday morning, but otherwise it is come to close down for the year with the traditional form of words.  This column will return in time for the first local by-elections of 2026, to be held in Hampshire and York on Thursday 15th January; until then, may you have a very merry Christmas, and may your 2026 be an improvement on your 2025.
