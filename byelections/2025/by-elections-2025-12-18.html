<h2>Broad Oak</h2>

South Ribble council, Lancashire; caused by the death of Liberal Democrat councillor Harold Hancock.

Our second Lancashire by-election of the week takes place in Penwortham, a town which manages to remain surprisingly obscure for its population of around 23,000.  The reason for this is its location: Penwortham lies on the south bank of the River Ribble immediately opposite Preston on the north bank, which gets all the attention.

Penwortham is to all intents and purposes a middle-class Preston suburb, and Broad Oak ward is crisscrossed by Preston's south-western arterial roads.  The ward includes Hurst Grange Park on ground sloping downward towards the river, and most of its housing lies abov the park.  In the 2021 census Broad Oak made the top 90 wards in England and Wales for Christianity (66.2%), which is a common feature of Lancashire wards, and it was also in the top 90 wards for lower managerial and professional occupations (27.9%).

The town of Penwortham has always maintained its independence from the city over the Ribble, and it has never been administered as part of Preston.  It's part of the South Ribble district which links together a number of towns to the south of Preston, some of which have grown into each other under the influence of Central Lancashire New Town development.

The South Ribble parliamentary seat, which has similar boundaries to the district, has been a bellwether since its creation in 1983.  It has had a rather large turnover of MPs in recent years: the fourteen years of Conservative government from 2010 to 2024 saw three different South Ribble MPs, the most recent of whom lost her seat in 2024 to Labour's Paul Foster.  Foster had been the leader of South Ribble council for five years before his election to Parliament, originally at the head of a Labour/Lib Dem coalition before Labour won a majority on the district in 2023.  In October last year Labour lost a by-election to the Conservatives in Middleforth ward, which borders Broad Oak to the south-east.

This area might sound like traditional marginal political territory, but in local elections Penwortham is the exception to that rule because it is the district's Lib Dem hotspot.  The present boundaries of Broad Oak ward date from 2015 and its two seats split between the Lib Dems and the Conservatives on that occasion, but the Tory vote here subsequently collapsed.  By 2023 the Conservatives were in third place in Broad Oak, which the Lib Dem slate won with a 65-17 lead over Labour.  The Lib Dem strength also carries over into Lancashire county council elections, where the Penwortham West division is strongly Lib Dem.

This Lib Dem hotspot is of very long standing, and the late Harry Hancock had been first elected for Broad Oak ward back in 2003.  He lost his seat to the Conservatives in 2011, but got it back in 2015 and then served continuously until his death in October at the age of 90.  Hancock had served as mayor of both South Ribble and Penwortham at various times.

A hard act to follow for the defending Lib Dem candidate Clare Burton-Johnson, who now has a chance at a winnable seat after contesting the next-door Middleforth by-election last year.  Labour have reselected Andy Rae who was their candidate here two years ago and finished as a rather distant runner-up.  Also on the ballot are Gareth Watson for the Conservatives and Reform UK's Lee Forshaw.

<h2>Market Harborough - Logan</h2>

Harborough council, Leicestershire; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Geraldine Whitmore.

Our next by-election is in one of those places which comes up in this column over and over again.  Indeed, this particular ward is holding its fifth by-election this century and its third in four years, and it was last previewed as recently as July.

The market town of Market Harborough lies on the main railway line from Leicester to London, and it once straddled the border between Leicestershire and Northamptonshire before a nineteenth-century reform placed the town solely within Leicestershire.  In mediaeval times it was a major population centre for Rockingham Forest, which is mostly part of Northamptonshire: Rockingham is a forest in the mediaeval sense of that word, meaning an area set aside for hunting; and this was still a major contributor to the local economy well into the nineteenth century, when Market Harborough was a foxhunting centre.  The National Hunt Chase, one of the horseraces from which the modern Cheltenham Festival grew, was first run in 1860 over the local countryside.
</p><p>
One famous nineteenth-century resident of Market Harborough was one Thomas Cook, who in 1841 was working as a wood-turner and was active in the temperance movement.  On 5th July 1841, shortly before he moved to nearby Leicester, Cook organised a rail excursion from Leicester to Loughborough to allow members of the Leicester Temperance Society to attend a meeting.  Thus was born what was, until it went bust in 2019, one of the world's great travel companies.
</p><p>
In modern times a major employer in the town is Harborough council, which was one of many district councils where the Conservatives lost control in 2023.  They are still the largest party on the council, but the 2023 election returned 15 Conservatives against 13 Lib Dems, 3 Labour and 3 Green councillors; a traffic-light coalition was formed under a Lib Dem leader.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/harborough-mkt-harborough-logan-2025.webp" alt="Harborough, Market Harborough - Logan" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
This places Market Harborough - Logan ward, which covers the north-west quadrant of the town, within the council majority.  The ward split its two councillors between the Conservatives and Lib Dems from 2007 to 2019 when there were major boundary changes, after which the Lib Dems pulled away here.  Shares of the vote here in 2023 were 47% for the Liberal Democrats, 27% for the Conservatives and 12% for Labour.
</p><p>
In 2024 the East Midlands region didn't return a single Lib Dem MP, and it appears that the party have given up on the Harborough constituency which was for many years seen as one of their best prospects in the region.  Harborough, Oadby and Wigston (as the seat was renamed for the 2024 general election) has been in Conservative hands since 1950, and the challenge to re-elected Conservative MP Neil O'Brien here last year came from Labour with the Lib Dems finishing fourth behind Reform UK.  O'Brien is now on the Conservative frontbench as shadow minister for policy renewal and development.
</p><p>
Market Harborough - Logan is split between the two Market Harborough divisions of Leicestershire county council, both of which combine half of the town with adjacent rural areas.  In 2025 Market Harborough East was a Lib Dem gain from the Conservatives, who held Market Harborough West and Foxton on a freak vote split with less than 25% of the vote; the Conservative county councillor finished 19 votes ahead of the Greens and 84 votes ahead of Reform UK.  RUK did well enough elsewhere in Leicestershire to finish as the largest party on a hung council, and they have formed a minority administration.
</p><p>
Those polls came a week after the death of Harborough councillor Barbara Johnson at the age of 82.  Following a career in education, Johnson had entered politics in 2007 as a councillor for Market Harborough - Great Bowden and Arden ward; she lost her seat there in 2015 but returned in 2019 as a councillor for Market Harborough - Logan, which she had represented since then.
</p><p>
The Liberal Democrats haven't lost many seats in by-elections this year, but the July by-election in Market Harborough - Logan was one of them.  A fragmented result saw the Conservative candidate Paul Bremner, who had represented this ward from 2007 to 2015 under different boundaries, return to Harborough council with 31% of the vote, against 27% for the Liberal Democrats, 22% for the Green Party and 15% for Reform UK.

The Conservatives now have the chance for a second gain following the resignation of Geraldine Whitmore, who had served since winning a previous by-election in 2022.  Whitmore quit the Liberal Democrats in October, shortly before a by-election in Fleckney ward which Reform UK gained from the Conservatives, and then stepped down from the council altogether for personal reasons.

The resulting December 2025 Market Harborough - Logan by-election could be crucial for control of Harborough council, which is finely balanced.  The administration is a traffic-light coalition, with 9 Lib Dems, 3 Labour and 3 Green councillors making a total of 15 seats plus this vacancy.  The Conservatives are the largest party with 15 seats, and with 18 seats needed for a majority the balance of power is held by three independent councillors and the Reform UK by-election winner.

So the stakes are high for the defending Lib Dem candidate, who this time is Marion Lewis: she has been involved for many years with Neighbourhood Watch at a high level, and in the 2010 Birthday Honours she was appointed OBE for services to community safety.  The Conservatives' David Page was elected in May as the county councillor for Market Harborough West and Foxton, and he is now seeking to double up at county and district level.  The Green Party have reselected Jake Bolton, who works for an events firm, following his strong third-place result in July.  Reform UK's Barry Walton, who has previously stood as a Conservative candidate for this council some years ago, was runner-up in Market Harborough East at May's county elections.  Also standing are Deborah Bennett for Labour, and Robin Lambert who polled just 10 votes here as an independent candidate in July's by-election; this time Lambert has the nomination of the Social Democratic Party.

<h2>Pakefield</h2>

Suffolk county council; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Melanie Vigo di Gallidoro.

For our Conservative defence this week we're going to go east.  You can't get any further east in the UK than Lowestoft, and the Pakefield division of Suffolk county council covers the southern fringe of the town.  Pakefield itself is on the seafront and was incorporated into Lowestoft in 1934; however, the place goes back a lot further, as archaeological remains - specifically, flint tools - have been found here which are over 700,000 years old.  The traditional industry in Pakefield is tourism: the Pontin's holiday camp to the south of the ward closed its doors last winter, but there is still a large caravan park on the rapidly-eroding clifftop if you fancy staying here.  To the west of Pakefield, and still part of Lowestoft's built-up area, is the parish of Carlton Colville where tourists can find the East Anglia Transport Museum and an area of marshland to the west of Lowestoft town which is part of the Broads National Park.

The town of Lowestoft was restored to the Parliamentary map last year after 64 years as part of the Waveney constituency.  It returned Labour MP Jessica Asato, who defeated the outgoing Conservative MP for Waveney Peter Aldous and the former Brexit Party MEP June Mummery in a close three-way split.

We saw a similar close three-way split in the Pakefield county division in 2013, with Labour candidates Sonia Barker and Peter Byatt elected ahead of UKIP and the Conservatives.  Barker and Byatt lost their seats in 2017 to the Conservative slate of Melanie Vigo di Gallidoro and Craig Rivett, who were very easily re-elected at the 2021 Suffolk county elections with a 57-26 lead over Labour.  This places Pakefield within the Conservative majority on the county council.

Lowestoft is the largest town in East Suffolk district, which was created in 2019 from a merger of the former Suffolk Coastal and Waveney districts and is England's largest second-tier district by population.  The ward and county division boundaries in East Suffolk don't match up, but this division takes in about half of Kirkley and Pakefield ward which was safely Labour in 2023, together with most of Carlton Colville ward which narrowly voted Conservative two years ago with the Lib Dems in second place.

Neither of the Conservative county councillors elected for Pakefield in 2021 made it to the end of their second terms.  Rivett resigned last year from both the county council and East Suffolk council.  Ihe two by-elections to replace him were held on the undercard of the 2024 general election, and Labour's Peter Byatt gained the county by-election in Pakefield: shares of the vote were 40% for Labour, 34% for the Conservatives and 14% for the Liberal Democrats.  The district council by-election in Carlton Colville ward, on the other hand, was a Conserative hold.  The cancellation of the 2025 Suffolk county elections means that they have been no polls here since then.

The voters of Pakefield division are now being called out for their second by-election of this extended term to replace Melanie Vigo di Gallidoro, who died in October at the age of 78.  Vigo di Gallidoro was Suffolk county council's representative on the Broads Authority, but she had spent her career in the North Sea fishing industry as director and secretary of Gallidoro Trawlers and then Dolphin Trawlers.

In that capacity Melanie Vigo di Gallidoro once had a ship named after her: one of Gallidoro Trawlers' vessels, a 3,000 ton beam trawler once valued at a million pounds, was named <em>De Vrouw Melanie</em>.  This vessel ran aground up the coast at Happisburgh in 1989 after developing an electrical fault at sea, but she was successfully refloated.  However, Gallidoro Trawlers went bust two years later, and the receivers sold <em>De Vrouw Melanie</em> for just £360.  She is still fishing today, currently operating out of Penzance under the name <em>Billy Rowney</em>.

The 2025 Suffolk county council elections look like they will finally go ahead in May 2026, so this will be the last by-election of the extended term.  Defending for the Conservatives is Letitia Smith, an estate agent who won the Carlton Colville ward by-election to East Suffolk council last year and is now seeking to double up at county and district level.  Labour, who won the 2024 by-election here, have nominated Sonia Barker who was previously a county councillor for this division from 2013 to 2017.  Barker, who was Labour's parliamentary candidate for Waveney in 2017 and 2019, also served on the old Waveney council from 2011 until she resigned in 2018; she is now a Lowestoft town councillor, and she was mayor of Lowestoft in 2023-24.   The Lib Dem candidate Chris Thomas is a retired schoolteacher who is a regular candidate in local elections in this general area; he previously contested Pakefield division in 2021.  Reform UK have clearly gone for their strongest available candidate in selecting June Mummery, who as stated was a Brexit Party MEP for the East of England from 2019 to 2020 and finished in a creditable third place in Lowestoft at the last general election; she completes the ballot paper along with the Green Party's Dom Taylor.

<h2>St Columb Minor and Colan</h2>

Cornwall council; caused by the resignation of Reform UK councillor Christine Parsonage.

We'll finish for the week with a trip down south to Cornwall to a place which has featured in this column twice before.  The village of St Columb Minor lies on the eastern edge of the town of Newquay, and its fifteenth-century church indicates a much older history than the town it's now a suburb of: St Column Minor was in fact the main settlement in this area before the Victorians developed Newquay into a seaside result.  Here can be found the Treviglas Academy, which is Newquay's main secondary school and sixth-form college: its former pupils include the Mebyon Kernow party leader Dick Cole and the singer-songwriter James Morrison.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZp6dhheriM

The parish of Colan covers the countryside to the east of Newquay.  Colan itself is an old but small village, and the parish's largest permanent settlement is Quintrell Downs which is on the main road and railway line from Newquay to the outside world.  Quintrell Downs is the last stop before Newquay for trains on the Atlantic Coast line.

There are also a large number of temporary settlements here.  St Columb Minor and Colan ward includes a number of large holiday and caravan parks, together with the wide and sandy Watergate Bay beach on the Atlantic coast which is popular with surfers.  The tale of how this bay brought down the Nixon presidency is yet to be fully told.  The population of this area swells every August when the Boardmasters music and surf festival is on, attracting over 50,000 attendees.  Next year's Boardmasters is scheduled for 5-9 August, with Fatboy Slim and Kasabian already booked as headliners.  The importance of tourism to the local economy is clear from St Columb Minor and Colan's 2021 census return, in which it made the top 70 wards in England and Wales for residents employed in accommodation and food service (13.5%).

Temporary residents of a different kind are associated with the RAF St Mawgan airbase, much of which is within the ward boundary; but St Mawgan isn't as busy today as it was in the Cold War years, and much of the airfield is now in civilian use as Newquay Airport.  And also as Spaceport Cornwall, although to date only one spacecraft launch has been attempted from here and that failed.  In 2023 Newquay Airport handled over 400,000 passengers, with its busiest route being to Gatwick.

Before 2021 St Column Minor itself was covered by the Newquay Treviglas division of Cornwall council, which featured twice in Andrew's Previews.  In 2013 Newquay Treviglas was one of six Cornish divisions to return a UK Independence Party councillor, but only one of those six councillors made it to the end of their four-year term; the Treviglas councillor resigned in 2016, and there was no UKIP candidate in the resulting by-election which was won by the Liberal Democrats.  The Lib Dem councillor then died in 2018, and the Conservatives' Mark Formosa gained the resulting by-election which was held in Boardmasters week.  Don't accuse politicians of not knowing how to party.

During this time Colan parish was part of the St Mawgan and Colan county division, which was a safe Conservative seat held by John Fitter.  When boundary changes for the 2021 election merged Fitter's seat with Formosa, Formosa got the Conservative nomination and Fitter decided to seek re-election as an independent candidate.  In a straight councillor versus councillor fight, Fitter defeated Formosa by 40 votes: in percentage terms, 51.6% to 48.4%.

The local parliamentary seat of St Austell and Newquay has voted for all three of the main Westminster parties since its creation in 2010.  Local elections in this corner of the constituency don't show much Labour support, but St Columb Minor and Colan has a Labour MP nonetheless: Noah Law, who gained his seat from the Conservatives in 2024, is a Cornishman who had previously worked as a financial analyst.

The Conservatives failed to win a single seat in Cornwall in the July 2024 Westminster election, and they also lost their majority on Cornwall council at the same time thanks to defection losses.  The 2025 Cornish elections returned a hung council, with 28 seats for Reform UK, 26 Lib Dems, 16 independents, 7 Conservatives, 4 Labour and 3 seats each for Mebyon Kernow and the Green Party.  Although Reform UK were the largest party they were a long way short of a majority, and a coalition of Liberal Democrat and independent councillors took control.  The Reform UK gains in Cornwall in May included St Columb Mior and Colan ward, where their candidate Christine Parsonage won with 36% of the vote against 29% for the outgoing independent councillor John Fitter and 17% for the Conservatives' Mark Formosa.  Parsonage lives over 40 miles away from this division in Torpoint, and she subsequently admitted that she had only stood as a paper candidate.

Christine's husband Rob Parsonage became leader of the Reform UK group on Cornwall council following May's election, but in October he walked out of the party to form a "Cornish Independent Nonaligned Group" on the council along with four of his former RUK colleagues.  This has left the Lib Dems as the largest party.  Christine Parsonage was initially part of the splinter group, but she then resigned from the council shortly afterwards on health grounds.

Defending this seat for Reform UK is Heinz Glanville, who is the only candidate to give an address in the ward.  Independent candidate John Fitter, who had represented Colan parish through successive boundary changes as a Conservative and then as an independent councillor from 2009 until he lost his seat in May.  Also seeking to return to Cornwall council is the Conservatives' Mark Formosa, who won the 2018 Newquay Treviglas by-election: Formosa had also previously served on the old Restormel council from 2003 to 2007, and he has stood twice for Parliament as the Conservative candidate for North Cornwall in 2005 and Taunton Deane in 2010.  Labour have selected Stuart Hinde, the Lib Dem candidate is former Cornwall councillor Geoff Brown who represented Newquay Central ward from 2009-21, independent candidate Nigel May will be hoping to improve on the 15 votes and last place he scored here in May, and the Greens have entered the fray with their candidate Frances Williamson.  All of the candidates except May have provided a statement to the local press <a href="https://www.voicenewspapers.co.uk/news/candidates-introduce-themselves-ahead-of-the-election-856426">here (link)</a>.

That completes the ordinary business of Andrew's Previews for the year.  But never fear!  It's Christmas, and we have a ghost story to bring you as we tell the tale of the by-election that never was...

<h2>CHRISTMAS BONUS TRACK:<br>
Bare</h2>

Lancaster council; caused by the disqualification of Kate Knight.

<!-- more text here -->

On 29th October, Bare ward's Conservative councillor Kate Knight was declared to be disqualified for failing to turn up to any meetings of the council in six months.  Knight spoke to the local press at the time saying "Unfortunately, in the last 12 months I've had a massive change in personal circumstances which has made it almost impossible to attend meetings".  The returning officer fixed a date of 11th December for the resulting by-election, polling stations were booked and candidate nominations were opened.

But then, on 5th November, it all fell apart.  New information came to light showing that Kate Knight was not in fact disqualified - which presumably means that the minutes of a meeting were found that showed she <em>had</em> in fact attended a council meeting within the previous six months.  The Bare by-election was called off, Knight was fully reinstated as a councillor, and we can assume that someone in Lancaster council's democratic services team has had a stern talking-to.

<h2>Review of the Year</h2>

"The same procedure as last year, Miss Sophie?"

With Christmas Day this year falling on a Thursday, that really is that for the electoral year of 2025.  It's been a relentless year for this column.  The forthcoming Christmas and New Year break finally ends an unbroken sequence of weekly Thursday columns going all the way back to the 6th February, so readers have been unusually spoiled this year.

In the meantime the farce of local government reorganisation continues to rumble on.  Your columnist was recently contacted by the Midlands politics correspondent of ITV News for comment on what was going on with the intended bonfire of our local councils, and my answer to that was basically that I have seen too many intended reorganisation schemes fall apart to be confident of what's going to happen on that front.  And cynicism turns out to be correct here as well: seven months on from a whole set of county council elections being postponed by a year in advance of local government reorganisation, only in Surrey do we have a clear plan for this and it would appear that the remaining county elections will be going ahead in 2026 - presumably combined with district council elections, which will give the returning officers involved a whole new series of headaches to deal with.  There was, in fact, no good reason to cancel most of the 2025 county elections and those postponements should not have happened without a clear, settled plan for the future of England's so-called "local" government.

So, what can we look forward to for 2026?

Well, I shall do my very best.  Paying subscribers will get a little Christmas present in their inboxes next Thursday morning, but otherwise it is come to close down for the year with the traditional form of words.  This column will return in time for the first local by-elections of 2026, to be held in Hampshire and York on Thursday 15th January; until then, may you have a very merry Christmas, and may your 2026 be an improvement on your 2025.
