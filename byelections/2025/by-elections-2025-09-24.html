For those of who were not taken by the Rapture, there is one by-election on Wednesday 24th September 2025:
</p><p>
<h2>Thetford Castle</h2>
</p><p>
<em>Breckland council, Norfolk; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Hazel McCambridge.</em>
</p><p>
We have an unusual Wednesday by-election to bring you today, from what was once one of the most important towns in East Anglia.  Thetford is an old town which can be found where the ancient Icknield Way crossed the confluence of the River Little Ouse and the River Thet.  It was natural for a town to grow up at this point, and by the time of the Domesday survey in 1086 Thetford was the sixth-largest town in England with a population of over 4,000 and its own bishop.  But the bishopric didn't last much longer, as the see of Thetford was translated to Norwich shortly afterwards.
</p><p>

</p><p>
By this point Thetford was controlled by the Bigod family, who became Earls of Norfolk and decided to erect a castle here.  Occupying a site overlooking the town which was previously home to an Iron Age hillfort, Thetford Castle was a motte-and-bailey structure on a massive scale: the motte, or mound, is claimed to be the second-largest man-made mound in England after Silbury Hill.  Although the earthwork survives, no trace of buildings on the top remain today: the Bigod family ended up on poor terms with Henry II, and Thetford Castle was captured and destroyed by the King's supporters during the failed 1173-74 revolt against Henry's rule.
</p><p>
After this Thetford never turned into a great town, and it was not until the development of London overspill estates in the 1960s that its population rose significantly above the Domesday level.  Further development in the 1990s and the 21st century has given us the Cloverfields estate in the north-east of the town, which combines with much older housing in the town centre to form Thetford Castle ward.

</p><p>
Thetford was one of the rotten boroughs which returned two MPs to Parliament from the 16th century onwards, with the right to vote being vested in the 31 members of the borough corporation.  For most of the 18th century Thetford's parliamentary seats were controlled by the FitzRoy family, the Dukes of Grafton, and many FitzRoys served as MPs for Thetford over the years.  To this day the Dukes of Grafton still occupy the country seat of Euston Hall, four miles to the south of the town.  (Euston station in London is named after Euston Hall, because it was developed on land previously owned by the Dukes of Grafton.)  However, in the 1790 general election the Duke's control over Thetford's elections was challenged by Lord Petre, and some expensive litigation was eventually settled out of court with an agreement that Grafton and Petre would nominate one Thetford MP each going forward.
</p><p>
This arrangement survived the Great Reform Act, and more or less remained in place until Thetford was disenfranchised by the Second Reform in 1868.  However, the electors had other ideas in the contested 1841 general election, when Henry FitzRoy, Earl of Euston and James Flower tied for the borough's second seat on 71 votes each and the returning officer refused to break the tie, instead declaring both of them elected.  Flower submitted a petition to Parliament, which decided this sort of dispute itself in those pre-Election Court days, and after a scrutiny of the votes cast Euston was unseated after having one vote knocked off his total.
</p><p>
Despite this record as a rotten borough, Thetford is known in radical politics as the birthplace of Thomas Paine.  He has a statue here.  It was also England's first town to have a black mayor: Allan Glaisyer Minns, a medical doctor who had been born in the Bahamas, served two terms in the civic chair in 1904 and 1905.

</p><p>
A later mayor of Thetford delivered one of the most memorable moments of the 2024 general election, by spectacularly unseating the former Conservative prime minister Liz Truss.  Terry Jermy, whose mayoral year was back in 2016-17, is now the Labour MP for South West Norfolk.  Jermy went on to resign his previous seats on both Norfolk county council and Thetford council, and the resulting by-elections in May for the Thetford West county division and Thetford Priory district ward were both won by Reform UK.
</p><p>
This area is rather less Labour-inclined than Jermy's former wards.  Thetford Castle ward was drawn up for the 2015 elections to Breckland council, which covers a large swathe of south-western Norfolk including the towns of Attleborough and Dereham.  It is the last of Norfolk's district councils to have a Conservative majority, but Thetford Castle is no longer in the Conservative column.  After splitting its two seats between the Conservatives and UKIP in 2015, then voting Conservative in 2019, Castle ward returned the Labour slate in 2023: shares of the vote were 42% for Labour, 29% for the Conservatives and 15% for an independent slate.  The cancellation of the scheduled Norfolk county elections in 2025 means that the Thetford East county division, which covers this ward, still has a Conservative county councillor.
</p><p>
The results of the May 2025 by-elections will have tipped Labour off that they have a fight on their hands to replace Hazel McCambridge, who has stood down from Breckland council on health grounds.  The defending Labour candidate Liz Bernard has had a long career teaching in nearby schools, most recently working as a special educational needs co-ordinator.  The Conservatives have selected Jane James, who has been the local county councillor since 2021: James previously represented this ward on Breckland council from 2019 until she lost her seat in 2023, and she is making a second attempt to get her Breckland seat back after contesting the Priory ward by-election in May.  This time there is no independent on the ballot paper so a fair number of votes are up for grabs; also hoping to pick those votes up are Reform UK's Grahame Middleton and the Lib Dems' Ian Minto.
