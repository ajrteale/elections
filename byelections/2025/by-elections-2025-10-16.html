<!-- Andrew's previews continue to be historical and electoral tours de force. - Lord Hayward -->
<blockquote>
"All the right votes, but not necessarily in the right order"
</blockquote>
</p><p>
Ten by-elections on 16th October 2025, Super Thursday:
</p><p>
<h2>Caterham Valley</h2>
</p><p>
<em>Surrey county council; and</em>
</p><p>
<h2>Whyteleafe</h2>
</p><p>
<em>Tandridge council, Surrey; both caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Jeffrey Gray.</em>
</p><p>
This is going to be one of those weeks where Andrew's Previews has something for everyone, with a wide political spread of wards.  Of the ten seats up for election today, the Liberal Democrats are defending four, Labour two and the other four are spread evenly between the Conservatives, the Green Party, the Scottish National Party and a localist group.  Today's Previews are also going to be a Surrey special, as six of today's ten polls take place in that county - including three by-elections to Surrey county council which may be crucial for future political control of the county.
</p><p>
We'll start by considering two simultaneous polls for the county council and for Tandridge council, which covers the eastern end of Surrey.  What they have in common is Whyteleafe, a village in a dry North Downs valley which lies just outside the Greater London boundary.  This is the sort of settlement name that an estate agent might invent right down to the Olde Tea Shoppe spelling, and that's pretty much what happened: in 1839 there was a White Leaf Field here, named after aspen trees growing nearby, and when the railways came shortly afterwards the name got oldeworldefied to try and attract commuters to move here.  I say railways here in the plural because Whyteleafe is served by two separate railway lines: Whyteleafe and Whyteleafe South stations are on the Caterham branch line, and Upper Warlingham station on the Oxted branch line is also within the ward boundary.
</p><p>
The census return for Whyteleafe ward indicates that this naming ploy worked, and indeed continues to work.  Whyteleafe makes the top 20 wards in England and Wales for households in shared ownership (7.7%), which is usually an indicator of significant recent housebuilding, and the top 20 wards for households with exactly one car or van (54.3%).  Its mixed-race population of 7.25% is exceeded by only two other wards in the South East region: Valley ward immediately to the south, and the very different area of Blackbird Leys ward in Oxford.
</p><p>
Whyteleafe, Valley and Harestone wards make up the Caterham Valley division of Surrey county council, which is based on the eastern half of the town of Caterham.  The Valley and Harestone wards of Caterham are also dominated by commuting, but Caterham used to have some manufacturing as the home of Caterham sports cars (which are now made in Dartford).  The largest employer in Whyteleafe, meanwhile, is the Gold Group whose head office is here: this is, of course, the parent company of Ann Summers.
</p><p>
As stated, the local authority here is Tandridge council, which is getting less and blue as the years go on because the local Conservatives are suffering from a severe case of electoral dysfunction: they can't get their vote to rise.  The number of Conservative councillors here has been in freefall for some years, as their councillors get run down like rabbits at the ballot box by rampant residents groups.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2024/tandridge24s.svgz" alt="Tandridge, 2024" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
All-out elections to Tandridge council in 2024 returned 20 councillors for various residents' parties, 11 Lib Dems, just 7 Conservatives and 5 independent councillors.  There are currently three vacant seats on the council, and this column will be back here in three weeks for two further by-elections.
</p><p>
This independent and localist challenge did not arise in the 2024 general election, in which the Conservative MP Claire Coutinho was re-elected easily as MP for East Surrey (a seat which has similar boundaries to Tandridge district) against split opposition.  Coutinho was a Cabinet minister going into that election as secretary of state for energy security and net zero, and she continues to shadow that position in opposition.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/surrey21s.svgz" alt="Surrey CC, 2021" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Tandridge's delegation to Surrey county council also still has a majority of Conservative councillors: at the last county council elections in 2021 the district's six county council seats split four to the Conservatives, one to an independent (Godstone) and one to the Liberal Democrats.  The Lib Dem seat was Caterham Valley, where the party had a 47-37 lead over the Conservatives.  County councillor Jeffrey Gray had intended to retire at the 2025 Surrey county elections, but when those were cancelled he decided to trigger a by-election instead.
</p><p>
Jeffrey Gray had only served on Surrey county council since 2021, but he had a longer history on Tandridge council where he was leader of the Lib Dem group until his resignation.  He was first elected for Whyteleafe ward in 2004, resigned from the council in 2010, and then returned in 2018.
</p><p>
In this century Whyteleafe has normally voted Lib Dem except in the Coalition years, when the Conservatives won here.  However, at the all-up elections in 2024 a new party, the Whyteleafe Residents Group, decided to stand and they effectively gobbled up the Conservative vote and a bit more besides.  Topline vote shares were 43% for the Whyteleafe Residents Group, 31% for the Lib Dems and 11% for Labour, with the Residents and the Lib Dems splitting the ward's two seats.  Jeffrey Gray was elected in second place, so the winner of this by-election will take over the rest of a three-year term ending in May 2027.
</p><p>
The Lib Dems have picked the same candidate to defend the Whyteleafe district by-election and the Caterham Valley county by-election.  Tony Pearce is a Caterham Valley parish councillor and deputy manager of the Westway Centre, a community hub in Caterham.  The list of candidates for the Whyteleafe district by-election reveals that the Whyteleafe Residents Group are not standing this time, so there an awful lot of votes up for grabs here.  The Labour candidate is Jon Wheale, who previously stood for Whyteleafe ward in 2022; back in the 2015 general election he was Labour's parliamentary candidate for Burton.  The Conservatives have selected Hoong-Wai Cheah, who has previously been a UKIP parliamentary candidate (he stood for Lewisham West and Penge in 2017) but whose most recent electoral outing was as a Conservative candidate for Godstone in the 2024 Tandridge elections.  Leo Domingues for the Greens and James Milmine for Reform UK complete the Whyteleafe ballot paper.
</p><p>
As stated Tony Pearce is also the defending Lib Dem candidate for the county council seat in Caterham Valley.  Here his Conservative opponent is Richard Mark, who is a Tandridge councillor for Portley and Queens Park ward in Caterham-on-the-Hill.  Labour's Jon Wheale and the Greens' Leo Domingues double up at district and county level, the Caterham Residents have entered the fray by nominating Caterham Valley parish councillor Peter Roberts, and Reform UK have selected Jacqueline Thomson for the county by-election.

<h2>Meadvale and St John's</h2>
</p><p>
<em>Reigate and Banstead council, Surrey; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Christopher Thompson.</em>
</p><p>
Our trip across Surrey continues with a visit to Redhill, which is one of the UK's more obscure towns to be counted as the head of a postcode district: a large chunk of eastern Surrey and northern Sussex has postcodes beginning RH.  Redhill lies on the old road and railway line from London to Brighton, and it was essentially created by the railways as a major junction: railway lines from here go north to London, east to the Channel Ports, south to Brighton and west to Guildford.  The settlement next to the station was originally known as Warwick Town, after Warwick Road which runs north-west from the town centre: the modern name Redhill dates from 1856 and was taken from Redhill Common, to the south-west of the town centre.
</p><p>
Redhill Common lies within Meadvale and St John's ward, which is named after two suburbs to the south of the common.  The church of St John the Evangelist, which occupies a prominent hilltop location on the North Downs, dates from 1843 and was substantially remodelled in the 1890s; the neighbouring St John's primary school was constructed three years earlier, with the money to build it coming from a compensation payment made by the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway to the parish for loss of rights over nearby common land.  To the west of here is Meadvale, an old suburb which had a flourishing pottery and brickworking industry in the 19th century that was displaced in the 20th century by the rise of London commuting.  Meadvale and St John's ward, which also includes a large chunk of south-eastern Reigate, makes the top 80 wards in England and Wales for residents working in lower managerial, administrative and professional occupations (28.1% of the workforce).
</p><p>
Despite the RH at the start of the postcodes here, the main town in this area is Reigate which has a long parliamentary history.  Reigate has been on the constituency map almost continuously since the 13th century: the town was disenfranchised by the Second Reform Act in 1868 as punishment for a series of corrupt elections, but the name then reappeared in 1885 as a county division of Surrey.
</p><p>
The Reigate constituency has returned Conservative MPs to Parliament continuously since January 1910, although it hasn't always had Conservative representation over that period.  In 1917 the local MP Richard Rawson defected to the National Party, a right-wing Conservative splinter group; in 1996 Sir George Gardiner became the only MP for the Referendum Party; while in 2023 Crispin Blunt lost the Conservative whip after being arrested by Surrey police on suspicion of rape and drugs offences.  The rape case against Blunt was eventually dropped earlier this year, but at the last update police were still investigating the drugs allegations.
</p><p>
Blunt was effectively forced to retire from the Commons in 2024, when the Reigate constituency returned the new Conservative candidate Rebecca Paul.  Paul came to the Commons from local government, and she still sits on Surrey county council as the representative for Tadworth, Walton and Kingswood.  In 2020 the county council moved its offices from Kingston upon Thames to Reigate, where they occupy a large office building at Woodhatch Place not far outside the boundary of this ward.
</p><p>
The local authority here is Reigate and Banstead council which is the last Surrey district council to be under Conservative leadership: however, the Tories are currently in a minority on the council.  The latest composition has 17 Conservatives against 13 Green Party councillors, 6 councillors elected for Residents' Associations, 6 independents, and 3 Lib Dems plus this vacancy.
</p><p>
Meadvale and St John's ward has traditionally been the Liberal Democrat hotspot in Reigate and Banstead district, but the Tories have never been that far behind and they did win this ward on a few occasions in the 2010s.  Shares of the vote in 2024 were 37% for the Liberal Democrats, 29% for the Conservatives and 18% for the Green Party.  Ward boundary changes in 2019 mean that the ward and Surrey county council division boundaries here no longer match up, but most of the ward is part of the Redhill West and Meadvale county division which voted Conservative when it was last contested in 2021.
</p><p>
The Liberal Democrats will now have to defend this by-election following the resignation of Christopher Thompson.  The talk of holding this seat falls to Mark Johnston, who is described as an experienced EU policy specialist: Johnston was the Lib Dem candidate for Reigate at the 2024 general election and is a regular local election candidate for the party in this district.  Standing for the Conservatives is Will de Save, who has recently completed his degree in history and politics at the University of Warwick: alongside his final-year studies, de Save was a candidate for Warwickshire county council in Leamington Spa in May's local elections.  A new name on our ballot papers is the Greens' Natasha Lawrence, who works in the NHS and has previous experience of Reigate and Banstead council as a former employee.  Also standing are Marcus Harriott for Reform UK and independent candidate Jonathan White, who was a Conservative councillor for this ward from 2018 to 2019 and previously tried to get his seat back in 2021, 2023 and 2024 as a Conservative candidate, finishing second on each occasion.  Whoever wins here will likely need to get straight back onto the campaign trail to secure re-election when their term expires in May 2026.

<h2>Guildford South East</h2>
</p><p>
<em>Surrey county council; caused by the resignation of Residents for Guildford and Villages county councillor Fiona Davidson.</em>
</p><p>
We now follow the North Downs ridge and railway to the west as far as Guildford, where the River Wey punches through the hills on its way to the Thames.  This was a natural place to put a castle in centuries gone past, and the ruins of the Norman Guildford Castle still dominate this area.  The castle is now in the hands of Guildford council, who have partially restored the keep and laid out gardens around it.  The gardens include a modern statue of Alice Through the Looking Glass, a tribute to Lewis Carroll who died in Guildford in 1898.
</p><p>
To the north of the castle we find the core of Guildford town centre, including the High Street leading down to the pedestrianised Town Bridge over the Wey.  On the High Street we find the Guildhall, a sixteenth-century building which for centuries has been home to the borough council.  Its unusual clock, which projects forward from the Guildhall's façade, was given to the town by a London clockmaker called John Aylward in return for the corporation giving him freedom to trade in the borough.
</p><p>
Guildford South East division's housing lies to the south and east of the town centre as the name might suggest.  The division boundaries include London Road (Guildford) railway station and the large Stoke Park, while the undeveloped land south-east of the town is part of the Surrey Hills National Landscape.
</p><p>
Stoke Park was donated to Guildford by the Earl of Onslow, who has traditionally been a major influence on the town both as a landowner and in politics.  Guildford has been continuously on the Parliamentary map since at least the 14th century, and many of its previous MPs have been Onslows including Arthur Onslow, who represented the town from 1720 to 1727 before commencing his record 33-year tenure as Speaker of the House of Commons.  Guildford was disenfranchised by the Third Redistribution in 1885 and since then the Guildford constituency has been a county division of Surrey: it was convincingly gained from the Conservatives in 2024 by the Lib Dems' Zöe Franklin, who joined the frontbench last month as the party's local government spokeswoman.
</p><p>
The Conservatives had previously lost control of Guildford council, which covers a larger area than the constituency, in 2019.  The 2019-23 term saw the council run by a coalition of the Liberal Democrats and a localist group called the Residents for Guildford and Villages, but in the 2023 local elections the Lib Dems won an overall majority and were able to dump their coalition partners.  At Guildford council level South East division is mostly covered by Castle ward, which in 2023 elected one councillor from the Residents for Guildford and Villages and two for the Conservatives, with the Lib Dems close behind both of them.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/surrey21s.svgz" alt="Surrey CC, 2021" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
This was a rather similar result to the 2021 Surrey county council election in the wider Guildford South East division, which was gained from the Conservatives by the Residents for Guildford and Villages.  Shares of the vote were 38% for the Residents, 31% for the Conservatives and 23% for the Lib Dems.  County councillor Fiona Davidson stood down at the beginning of September, four years and four months into her four-year term of office, indicating that she could no longer give her democratic duties the time and energy they need.
</p><p>
To hold this seat the Residents for Guildford and Villages have selected John Redpath, a former Guildford councillor who served in that council's cabinet during the 2019-23 coalition administration: Redpath represented Holy Trinity ward, the predecessor to the present Castle ward where he finished as runner-up in 2023.  On that occasion Redpath finished just ahead of the Conservatives' Alex Fiuza, who was also an unsuccessful candidate for Guuildford council in 2019 and for Southampton council during his university studies in 2016.  The Lib Dems have selected Catherine Houston, who is Guildford council's cabinet member for climate change and leisure: she represents Shalford ward on that council.  Also standing are Richard Eggleton for Labour, Dale Layman for Reform UK and Claire Whitehouse for the Green Party.

<h2>Camberley West</h2>
</p><p>
<em>Surrey county council; caused by the death of Conservative county councillor David Lewis.</em>
</p><p>
For the last of our trio of Surrey county council by-elections we travel north-west from Guildford into the Blackwater Valley.  As this column pointed out last week in connection with Yateley, this is the centre of a large urban conurbation focused on the defence industry which is really badly served by England's local government, thanks to its location at the point where Surrey, Hampshire and Berkshire all meet.  The actual triple point is in the River Blackwater just to the east of Blackwater railway station.
</p><p>
South-east from this triple point we find the Camberley West county division, which covers an urban area that's not just the western end of Camberley: the division boundary crosses the M3 motorway to take in Frimley to the south, while to the north of the old A30 road is military land which is part of the grounds of the Sandhurst academy.
</p><p>
Like Redhill, Camberley is another town which changed its name in the nineteenth century: this time on the initiative of the Post Office, who got tired of misrouting mail addressed to the previous settlement name of "Cambridge Town".  The name of Cambridge Town had been a reference to Prince George, Duke of Cambridge, who was a cousin of Queen Victoria and spent most of her reign as commander-in-chief of the Army.  What he thought of the town's name change to Camberley does not appear to have been recorded.
</p><p>
The Royal Family continue to have connections to this area, and the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh's children James, Earl of Wessex and Lady Louise Windsor were both born within Camberley West division at Frimley Park Hospital, which is the main general hospital for the Blackwater Valley conurbation.  The present hospital building dates from 1974, and it needs rebuilding due to extensive use of unsafe RAAC concrete in its construction.  The hospital propels the Frimley ward of Surrey Heath into the top 100 wards in England and Wales for residents working in the health and social care sector (23.8%), while the two Surrey Heath wards which roughly correspond to the Camberley part of the division - St Michaels and Watchetts - are both in the top 40 wards for Buddhism.  The latter statistic is a side-effect of Gurkha immigration into the UK, which has been concentrated in the Blackwater Valley conurbation.
</p><p>
The local authority for this particular corner of the Blackwater Valley is Surrey Heath council, which has had a Liberal Democrat majority since 2023.  It now also has a Liberal Democrat MP to match, after Al Pinkerton gained the Surrey Heath constituency from the Conservatives in 2024 on the retirement of the seat's long-serving and high-profile previous MP Michael Gove.  Before his election Pinkerton had been an academic specialising in geopolitics, and he is now on the Lib Dems' frontbench as their Europe spokesman.
</p><p>
This Lib Dem strength in Surrey Heath is a rather recent phenomenon, because Camberley has historically been one of the few parts of the Surrey county council area where the Labour Party can poll half-decent scores in local elections.  In the 2019 Surrey Heath elections the three wards which roughly correspond to this county division were all straight fights between the Conservatives and Labour with the Tories winning all six council seats comfortably.  But in 2023 the Conservatives lost all six seats, with St Michaels going to Labour and Frimley and Watchetts to the Lib Dems; again, all three wards were straight fights with the Lib Dems and Labour not opposing each other.
</p><p>
This result followed the Lib Dems finishing in a strong second place in Camberley West at the May 2021 county council elections.  The seat remained safely in the Conservative column with their candidate David Lewis winning by 49-33, as Labour - who had previously ran second in this division - fell to a poor third.
</p><p>
David Lewis died in August at the age of 64, after a long illness.  He was an RAF veteran who had served on the county council since 2021, and he had previously been a Surrey Heath councillor from 2015 to 2023, serving for Watchetts ward and rising to hold the finance portfolio on that council's cabinet.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/surrey21s.svgz" alt="Surrey CC, 2021" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Lewis' death, followed by the Conservatives' loss of two county council by-elections later that month, tipped Surrey county council into No Overall Control for the first time since 1997.  The Conservatives have since got their majority back as the result of the resignation of two opposition councillors, but today's three county council by-elections represent the moment of truth.  With 41 seats needed for a majority, the Conservatives are on 39, the Liberal Democrats on 16, various Residents Associations have 12, there are two seats each for the Green Party, Labour and Reform UK, five independent councillors and three vacant seats.  The Conservatives need to win two of today's Surrey by-elections to keep their majority, which probably means holding this seat and gaining either Guildford South East from the Residents or Caterham Valley from the Lib Dems.
</p><p>
So the stakes are high for the defending Conservative candidate Attieh Fard: she is a solicitor who runs her own practice in Camberley.  The Lib Dems have reselected Alan Ashbery, who finished in second place here in 2021 and was subsequently elected as a Surrey Heath councillor for Frimley ward in 2023.  Also standing are Simon Schofield for Labour and Darryl Ratiram - a former Surrey Heath Conservative councillor who works as a doctor at Frimley Park Hospital - for Reform UK.

<h2>Staines</h2>
</p><p>
<em>Spelthorne council, Surrey; caused by the resignation of Green Party councillor Adam Gale.</em>
</p><p>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-YYroSudUs
</p><p>
Big up da West Staines Massive there.  Yes, we have come to the home town of Ali G, a character of Sacha Baron Cohen who first hit our screens on <em>The Eleven O'Clock Show</em> nearly three decades ago now.  (God, that makes me feel old.)  For the benefit of those who are too young, too old or too uncool to remember Ali G, his shtick was to conduct a series of interviews, like the one above, with public figures and celebrities with the intention of getting them to say or do something stupid.  Tony Benn - who later admitted that he hadn't realised he'd been pranked until after the programme had gone out - gave as good as he got.
</p><p>
Ali G's home town was of course Staines, a town on the north bank of the River Thames which was one of the few parts of Middlesex to escape incorporation into Greater London; it was instead transferred to Surrey in 1965.  Since 1974 the parts of Surrey north of the Thames, including Staines-upon-Thames (as it now is), have formed the Spelthorne local government district.
</p><p>
Like Whyteleafe, Staines is outside Greater London but within the M25 motorway and there are frequent trains from here into the centre of the Great Wen.  Although Staines is more multicultural than Whyteleafe the commuter demographic remains strong, and Staines ward makes the top 30 in England and Wales for residents working in the information and communication sector.
</p><p>
The town is also just a few miles to the south of Heathrow Airport, which makes Staines and the surrounding area an attractive location for multinational businesses which want to set up UK offices.  Spelthorne council, which is the local authority here, has invested very heavily in office and commercial property in this general area over the years and they have taken on a massive amount of debt to do so, which is one reason why the Commissioners have been sent in here and that local government reorganisation in Surrey is being prioritised.
</p><p>
Spelthorne has been a very messy hung council since the borough's ruling Conservative group fell apart in 2020.  The 2023 elections here returned 12 Conservative councillors, 10 Lib Dems, 7 independents, 7 Labour councillors and 3 Greens; the Lib Dems, the Greens and independent councillors are running the show under an independent leader.
</p><p>
Staines ward had a full slate of Conservative councillors until 2019, when the three seats here split two to the Green Party and one to Labour.  The Greens successfully defended a by-election here in July 2021.  In 2023 Labour lost their seat to an independent candidate: topline shares of the vote were 36% for the Greens, 27% for the independent and 22% for Labour, although the fact that the Conservatives were the only party to put up a full slate means that these figures should be taken with a pinch of salt.
</p><p>
The Staines county division is still in Conservative hands, as is the Spelthorne constituency.  In 2024 the latter seat returned Conservative MP Lincoln Jopp, who came to politics from a glittering career in the Army where he reached the rank of colonel: Jopp was awarded the Military Cross for service in Sierra Leone in 1997, and he was commander of the Scots Guards at Trooping the Colour in 2011.  He took the Spelthorne seat over from the retiring Kwasi Kwarteng, whose tenure as Liz Truss' chancellor will not be forgotten for a very long time.
</p><p>
The Green Party now have to defend a Staines ward by-election for the second time in four years, to replace Adam Gale who had served since 2023.  Gale has relocated to Dubai for work.
</p><p>
The defending Green candidate here is Stuart Whitmore, who won a Spelthorne council by-election in May 2022 in Laleham and Shepperton Green ward but lost his seat at the ordinary election the following year; Whitmore is making his second attempt to return the council after previously contesting a September 2023 by-election in Ashford Town ward.  The council's independent group - and, interestingly, outgoing Green councillor Gale - have endorsed independent candidate Sean Freeman, who is fighting his first election campaign.  Labour have selected Jared Kidd, who works in warehousing and logistics: he was previously an unsuccessful candidate for a by-election in Ashford East ward in July 2024.  Also standing are Mark Francis for the Conservatives, Laura Barker for the Lib Dems, Paul Couchman for the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition, and Harry Phillips for Reform UK.

<h2>Copdock and Washbrook</h2>
</p><p>
<em>Babergh council, Suffolk; caused by the death of Liberal Democrat councillor David Busby.</em>
</p><p>
As England's district names go, Babergh is up there with the most obscure of them.  Not many people even know how to pronounce it, and I'm one of them.  Not many people know where it is either, but this column can at least help you with that.
</p><p>
The name of Babergh district is a reference to the ancient Babergh Hundred of Suffolk, which covered an area in the south of the county around the town of Sudbury.  But that's not where we are today: the modern local government district also takes in the ancient Hundreds of Cosford and Samford, and it's in the latter that the Copdock and Washbrook by-election is taking place.
</p><p>
The villages of Copdock and Washbrook, which share a parish council and have 942 electors between them, lie just to the south-west of Ipswich on the old road to London.  Indeed the London Road through the villages was once part of the A12 and it is still a dual-carriageway road; but when the A14 Ipswich Bypass was built in the 1990s the A12 was diverted to the east of the villages to meet the new road, and the old London Road was blocked off east of Washbrook.  The ward includes six other parishes to the west and south-west of Ipswich, of which the largest is Bentley with 727 voters on the roll.
</p><p>
Babergh council has been under No Overall Control throughout its existence with the exception of one term of Conservative majority from 2015 to 2019: this very rural district is one of the remaining English strongholds of the rural independent councillor, and the Liberal Democrats also have strength here at local level.  However, the 2023 election broke this pattern as the Green Party finished top with 10 seats out of a possible 32; independent candidates won 9, the Conservatives 7, the Lib Dems 5 and Labour 1.  A coalition of Green, independent and Lib Dem councillors is running the show with the council leadership rotating between them; currently it's the Lib Dems' term to sit in the top chair.
</p><p>
This pattern is not seen at Parliamentary level, where Copdock and Washbrook ward is part of the South Suffolk constituency which the Conservatives' James Cartlidge has represented since 2015.  Cartlidge never got above junior ministerial level while the Tories were in power, but since 2024 he has been in Sunak's and Badenoch's shadow cabinets as shadow defence secretary.  At the most recent Suffolk county council elections in 2021 this ward was divided between the Belstead Brook and Samford divisions, both of which were safely Conservative.
</p><p>
Despite this lack of a Lib Dem track record at other levels of government, the late David Busby had a long career on Babergh council and he was deputy leader of the council when he passed away in July.  He was first elected in 2003 for the neighbouring Pinewood ward, which covers suburbia on the south-western edge of Ipswich, before transferring here in 2019 following boundary changes.  Busby also served as the Suffolk county councillor for Belstead Brook from 2013 to 2017.  At his last re-election in 2023 Busby enjoyed a 56-30 lead over the Conservatives.
</p><p>
Defending this seat for the Lib Dems is Mark Hurley, a former teacher who is a parish councillor in East Bergholt to the south of the ward; in the 2021 Suffolk county elections Hurley was an independent candidate for Samford division which covers the south of this ward, finishing in a rather distant second place on that occasion.  According to the excellent website whocanivotefor.co.uk, Hurley's favourite biscuit is "all of them".  The Conservatives have selected Harry Cansdale, who would have been a county council candidate in May in the Sudbury area had that election not been postponed.  Also standing are Miriam Burns for the Greens, Marc Rowland for Reform UK and Simon Whitney for Labour.

<h2>Broadheath</h2>
</p><p>
<em>Trafford council, Greater Manchester; caused by the death of Labour councillor Denise Western.</em>
</p><p>
We now come to the week's two Labour defences, which are both in north-west England.  Trafford is one of the ten boroughs of Greater Manchester, combining inner-city Stretford and more comfortable Urmston north of the Mersey with the very middle-class towns of Sale and Altrincham to the south of the river.  Broadheath ward straddles the Sunderland Brook, the old boundary between Altrincham and Sale.  It's mostly Altrincham, based on the Broadheath and West Timperley areas located to the north of the Bridgewater Canal along the main road to Manchester, but the ward also takes in a corner of southern Sale along Woodhouse Lane.  The ward has a commuter demographic, which is served by Timperley tram stop on its eastern boundary; one peculiarity of its census return is a relatively high Hindu population.
</p><p>
Trafford council has been on an interesting political journey in this century.  Very unusually for a metropolitan borough, it retained a Conservative majority well into the last period of Conservative government; but now the Tories are a very poor second on the council, with the latest composition having 41 Labour councillors plus this vacancy against just 8 Conservatives, 7 Lib Dems and 6 Greens.  The collapse started after the Brexit referendum, in which Trafford voted to remain in the EU while Altrincham's Conservative MP Graham Brady was a prominent Leaver, and may have been exacerbated by demographic change in the Urmston area which has become a popular location for urban professionals priced out of Manchester.
</p><p>
The process of Tory collapse was completed in 2024 when Altrincham returned its first-ever Labour MP, following Brady's retirement.  Connor Rand, who was a last-minute replacement on the ballot for Altrincham and Sale West after the originally-selected Labour candidate withdrew, is a former Labour Party staffer associated with the USDAW union.
</p><p>
This Broadheath by-election will be an indication of whether the Conservative machine here has recovered, because this ward has been closely fought between Labour and the Conservatives for well over a decade now.  Since Denise Western's first win here in 2012 Labour have generally had the upper hand and the Conservatives have only topped the poll in 2015, but when new ward boundaries were introduced in 2023 Broadheath split its three seats, with Labour polling 40% and winning 2 seats to the Conservatives' 37% and one seat.  In May 2024 Labour gained the Conservative seat by just six votes, with Ulrich Savary defeating the previous Conservative councillor Kaushik Chakraborty by 1,716 votes to 1,710.  On that occasion the percentage score for both parties was 41%.
</p><p>
Denise Western, who passed away in late August, had served continuously since she was first elected as a councillor for Broadheath ward in 2012.  Her election leaflet from that campaign said "I’ve lived in Broadheath Ward with my family since 1984 and work for a multi-national company based in Didsbury. I have five grown up children – all of whom attended Park Road Primary and local secondary schools – and one grandchild."  One of her children has since gone on to greater things: Denise Western's son Andrew served as the Labour leader of Trafford council from 2018 until he was elected to Parliament in a December 2022 by-election, as the Labour MP for Stretford and Urmston.
</p><p>
This knife-edge by-election is defended for Labour by Mahvish Masood, who is fighting her first election campaign.  She is up against the ward's regular Conservative candidate and former councillor Kaushik Chakraborty, a GP who lost his seat here in 2024 and wants it back.  Also standing are Alexander Young for the Greens, Deborah Rhodes for Reform UK, Louise Bird for the Lib Dems, and independent candidate Stephen Farndon who has stood in this ward at every election since 2016 and finished last in all but one of his previous campaigns.

<h2>Ashton</h2>
</p><p>
<em>Preston council, Lancashire; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Robert Boswell.</em>
</p><p>
Our last English by-election of the week takes place on the north bank of the River Ribble.  Preston Docks were once a busy inland port centred on the Albert Edward Basin, named after the future Edward VII who laid its foundation stone in 1885; when the basin opened in 1892, it was the largest dock in Europe.  The Preston Docks boomed in the years after the Second World War, when passenger ferries operated to Northern Ireland and the whole of Dominica and St Lucia's annual citrus crop came through here.
</p><p>
But falling demand and financial problems led to the closure of the dock in 1981, and the area around it has been substantially redeveloped since then for housing, industry and leisure.  One survivor is part of the docks' railway system, which was retained to allow rail access to a bitumen refinery: this line is also used by the Ribble Steam Railway, a preserved line which has operated since 2005.
</p><p>
The docks have essentially cut Ashton-on-Ribble off from the river which gave this Preston suburb its name.  Ashton-on-Ribble lies in the west of the town, and all transport links between Preston city centre and Blackpool pass through here.  Most of Ashton ward outside the docks area is covered by terraced housing, but the ward also includes the open spaces of Haslam Park and Ashton Park.  The latter was originally the grounds of a 19th-century mansion built by and for the Pedder family, who ran the Old Preston Bank and were major investors in Preston's industry during the 19th century.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, when Edward Pedder suddenly died here in 1861 at the age of 50 it turned out that he and his brother had been borrowing heavily from the bank to finance their lifestyles, and the house and its land had to be sold to pay the Old Bank's creditors.  The buyer was Edmund Harris, who bequeathed to Preston the Harris Museum and a number of buildings for the educational institution which would eventually evolve into the University of <s>Central</s> Lancashire.  Ashton House and the associated park came into the hands of Preston Corporation in 1936; the house itself has since been sold off and it is now home to a nursery, while the park has been the subject of local controversy over plans by the council to build football pitches on it.
</p><p>
The modern-day Preston council has been under Labour control since 2011 and Ashton ward is part of that majority.  One of its current councillors is Elizabeth Atkins, who is the widow of the former Preston North MP Ronald Atkins and stepmother of the former Staffordshire Moorlands MP Charlotte Atkins.  Elizabeth was four decades younger than Ronald, who died in December 2020 at the age of 104 and set a record as the longest-lived British MP with a registered date of birth.  (His record has since been broken by Sir Patrick Duffy, who is still with us at the age of 105 years and 5 months.)  When Ronald Atkins was an MP there were two Preston constituencies: now there is just one, which has been represented since a 2000 by-election by Labour backbencher Sir Mark Hendrick.
</p><p>
Boundary changes for the 2019 Preston elections expanded Ashton ward, adding the docks, a corner of the former Tulketh ward and a third councillor.  The previous Ashton ward had voted Conservative up to and including 2008, but the present version was safe Labour when it was last contested in 2024: Labour had a 59-21 lead over the Lib Dems, who took second place off the Conservatives.
</p><p>
Then the 2025 Lancashire county council elections happened.  Elsewhere in the county they were a Reform UK earthquake, but that wasn't the case here.  Most of Ashton ward is part of the Preston South West county division, which also takes in Lea and Larches ward where the Lib Dems gained two seats last year (one in the May ordinary election, another in a July 2024 by-election).  The Lib Dems went on to gain Preston South West in May 2025 from Labour, who fell to a poor third behind Reform UK.  The docks are part of Preston City division which returned a "Gaza" independent candidate, while the area transferred from Tulketh ward in 2019 is covered by Preston Central West division which was the only division in the city that Labour managed to keep hold of.
</p><p>
Not the most promising backdrop to this by-election, which is triggered by the retirement of long-serving Labour councillor Robert Boswell.  He was first elected to Preston council almost forty years ago, serving from 1986 to 1998 and then from 2007 to 2019 as a councillor for Tulketh ward before transferring here in the 2019 boundary changes.  Twelve of those years were spent in the council cabinet, and Boswell also rose to the position of deputy leader of the council: in that role he took over the council leadership on an acting basis between December 2017 and May 2018 while the then council leader was being treated for a brain tumour.
</p><p>
Defending this seat for Labour is Mark Routledge, who was previously a councillor for Ashton ward from 2011 to 2021 when he stood down: he was the losing Labour candidate in last year's Lea and Larches ward by-election.  The Lib Dems have selected Ronan Hodgson who gives an address in the docks area and is standing in his first election.  Also on the ballot are Kevin Brockbank for the Conservatives, independent candidate Aran Bailey who is associated with a group calling themselves the Preston Independents, independent candidate Ann Cowell who stood in both Lea and Larches ward elections last year and is opposed to the council's plans for Ashton Park, and Reform UK's Lee Slater who was runner-up in Preston South West in May's county elections.

<h2>Ayr North</h2>
</p><p>
<em>South Ayrshire council, Scotland; caused by the death of Scottish National Party councillor Mark Dixon.</em>
</p><p>
We finish with another ward that includes a docks area.  The Port of Ayr is a lot smaller than Preston Docks was, but unlike Preston Docks it is still very much in operation, handling over 300,000 tonnes of cargo each year plus the occasional cruise ship.  Its operator Associated British Ports describes Ayr as "the first commercial port encountered by vessels entering the Firth of Clyde", which will come as a bit of a surprise to the residents of Stranraer.
</p><p>
The Port of Ayr lies at the mouth of the River Ayr where it flows into the Firth of Clyde.  The part of Ayr town north of the river is generally in Ayr North ward, which is rather downmarket compared to the rest of the town: the main suburbs are Whitletts and Dalmelling in the east of the town, and Newton-on-Ayr to the north.  The ward includes Ayr racecourse, which is home to the Scottish Grand National each April, and it is served by Newton-on-Ayr railway station which has regular electric trains to Ayr town centre and Glasgow.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2022/s-ayrshire22s.svgz" alt="S Ayrs, 2022" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
The local authority here is South Ayrshire council, where the Conservatives are the largest party and run a minority administration: the 2022 elections here returned 10 Conservative councillors, 9 SNP, 5 Labour and 4 independents.  Ayr North is the strongest SNP ward in the council area, with first preferences in 2022 coming in at 46% for the Nationalists, 24% for Labour and 21% for the Conservatives; with proportional representation in effect, the four seats split two to the SNP and one each to Labour and the Conservatives.  If that election had been for one seat, then the SNP's Laura Brennan-Whitefield - who polled almost two quotas in her own right - would have defeated Labour's Ian Cavana by 58-42 after transfers.
</p><p>
A year earlier the SNP had gained the Ayr constituency from the Conservatives at the 2021 Scottish Parliament election, in which incumbent Tory MSP John Soctt - who had served since winning a by-election in 2000 - was defeated by the SNP's Siobhian Brown by just 170 votes.  Brown is now a junior minister in the Scottish government, with responsibility for victims and community safety; before her election to Holyrood she had been a South Ayrshire councillor for Ayr West ward.
</p><p>
The Westminster boundaries in Ayrshire were left completely alone in the 2024 boundary review, which means they are still based on a previous set of ward boundaries which were abolished in 2007.  That leaves Ayr North ward split between constituencies.  Most of it is in the Ayr, Carrick and Cumnock seat which has returned six different MPs at its last six elections: the current incumbent is Labour's Elaine Stewart, who gained the seat from the SNP in 2024.  The Woodfield area in the north of Ayr North ward is included in the Central Ayrshire constituency, which was gained from the SNP by Labour's Alan Gemmell last year.
</p><p>
This by-election is to replace Mark Dixon, who was in his first term on the council, after he suddenly passed away in July.  Dixon was originally elected for the Scottish National Party, but he had since left the SNP to go independent; in May he had joined the council's cabinet with the sport and leisure portfolio.
</p><p>
The SNP will want their seat back in this by-election and they have selected Ian Douglas, who is seeking to return to South Ayrshire council after some years away: Douglas previously represented Ayr East ward from 2007 to 2017.  The Labour candidate John Duncan was an unsuccessful candidate for Ayr West ward in 2022 and has worked as an advisor to the current Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar.  The Conservatives went for two seats here in 2022, and their unsuccessful candidate on that occasion David Paterson is trying again.  The rather distant runner-up here in 2022 was independent candidate Andrew Russell, who is also trying again and this time has the Reform UK nomination; independent candidate Orhan Bulikj describes himself as an entrepreneur and community activist and is clearly going for the TikTok vote; another independent candidate is Wullie Hogg who runs a fencing and gate firm in the town; a third independent candidate is David Petrie who is a community councillor in Ayr; and the 2022 Liberal Democrat candidate for this ward, Mason Graham, is back for another go.  This is a Scottish local by-election, so Votes at 16 apply and please rank the candidates on your ballot paper in order of preference.
