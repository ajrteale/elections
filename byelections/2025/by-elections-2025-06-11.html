One by-election on Wednesday 11th June 2025:
</p><p>
<h2>Severn</h2>
</p><p>
Stroud council, Gloucestershire; caused by the death of Labour councillor Richard Maisey.
</p><p>
Six days ago this column was discussing the Scottish Parliament by-election in the Lanarkshire constituency of Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse.  This week we're off to a different Stonehouse, in Gloucestershire.  Or, more accurately, we're going to the countryside to the west of that particular Stonehouse.
</p><p>

The Severn ward of Stroud lies in the Severn valley south of Gloucester, at a point where the estuary suddenly meanders a couple of miles to the west, and then comes back again in a horseshoe bend before resuming its journey south-west to the Bristol Channel.  The result of this is that the village of Arlingham is surrounded on three sides by the river, while on the fourth side it is cut off by the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal which cuts the corner for boat traffic.  It's on this canal, rather than the riverbank, that we find the village of Frampton on Severn which claims to have England's village green.

</p><p>
The M5 motorway between Gloucester and Bristol, and the A38 road which it replaced, run through the east part of this ward.  Whitminster lies on the old road, while to the east of the motorway are two villages which are of similar size but very different in character.  Eastington is an old village to the west of Stonehouse which used to have a textile industry; Great Oldbury, by contrast, is a very large and very new housing development on the western edge of Stonehouse which declared independence from Eastington last year and became a parish of its own.  It's already become the largest polling district in Severn ward, with 1,593 electors on the roll, and the new development has caused the ward's electorate to increase by 42% between the 2016 and 2024 elections.
</p><p>
One wonders whether all this new development will have had an effect on Severn ward's elections.  The ward was safely Conservative in both the 2016 and 2021 elections, as was the pre-2016 Severn ward which had rather different boundaries.  But in May 2024 Severn ward's two Conservative councillors both retired and the ward split its two seats: Robert Brown topped the poll with 706 votes and held one of the Conservative seats, but his running-mate Hena Mannan-Rahman was some way behind on 504 votes allowing Labour candidate Richard Maisey to take the second seat with 683 votes.  Topline vote shares were 34% for the Conservatives, 32% for Labour and 18% for the Green Party.  Two months later the Stroud parliamentary seat was gained from the Conservatives by Labour candidate Simon Opher, a GP who had been appointed MBE in 2016 for services to healthcare and patients' wellbeing in Gloucestershire.
</p><p>
The Stroud council elected in May 2024 was hung, with the Green Party finishing top on 22 seats against 20 Labour councillors, 7 Conservatives and 2 Lib Dems.  The Greens formed a minority administration, and they generally did very well in the 2025 county elections in Stroud: the party convincingly gained a district council by-election from Labour in Stroud Central ward and they won six of Stroud's eleven county council seats.  But of the county divisions covering Severn ward, the Conservatives managed to hold on to Hardwicke and Severn division while Stonehouse division (which covers Eastington and Great Oldbury) voted narrowly for Reform UK with the Greens a close second.
</p><p>
Stonehouse had previously been represented by Conservative county councillor Nick Housden, who had been a favourite of <em>Private Eye</em> during his four years in office.  Housden's council term got off to a bad start in 2021, when it was revealed that he had received a two-year suspended prison sentence for blackmail some years previously.  This didn't stop him joining the county council's cabinet with the public health and communities portfolio, but in April 2023 Housden was charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm against a business partner.  This got him suspended from the Gloucestershire Conservative group pending his trial in December 2023, at which a jury at Cirencester crown court found him not guilty.
</p><p>
Housden was then readmitted to the Conservative whip, but in October 2024 he was suspended from the party again.  What prompted this has never been made clear - the Conservative group's statement at the time referred to "allegations" without going into any more details - but over the last year or so Housden has been the subject of negative publicity over financial and governance issues at the Carlton Club, a private members' club in Stroud which he was chairman of until last year.  Two days before this year's local elections <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1egy3g8nd6o">the BBC carried a report that Housden had been accused of forging signatures</a> to obtain loans totalling Â£150,000 for the club from the Association of Conservative Clubs.  This wasn't exactly helpful to Housden's attempt to seek re-election to the county council as an independent candidate, and he ended up finishing in fourth place in Stonehouse with 14% of the vote.
</p><p>
In the meantime Stroud Labour have troubles of their own, having lost a number of county council seats here in May plus the Stroud Central ward by-election, vacated by former Labour MP David Drew whose resignation statement in February pointed to major infighting in the party.  And Labour now have an even more difficult by-election to defend following the death of Richard Maisey in April at the age of 73.  Maisey, who was a retired solicitor and Eastington parish councillor, had done well to win last year in a ward which is difficult territory for Labour at the best of times.  These are not the best of times.
</p><p>
Defending the Severn ward by-election for Labour is Karen Linforth, who contested the neighbouring Stonehouse ward in 2024 and stood in Stonehouse at last month's county elections: Linforth is an Eastington parish councillor and USDAW rep.  The Conservatives have reselected their losing candidate from last time Hena Mannan-Rahman, who works in the healthcare industry: she stood in Stroud Central in May both for the county council and in the district coucnil by-election.  The Green Party's Moya Shannon, a former teacher who now works for her family's carpentry company, is also back for another go after standing here in 2021 and 2024.  Also on the ballot are Mike Stayte of the Lib Dems who is another returning candidate from 2024, UKIP's Ben Walker who was last seen on a ballot paper in 2022 at the Tiverton and Honiston by-election, and Reform UK's Jonathan Wren: in May's county elections Wren contested Dursley division, which does not cover this ward.
