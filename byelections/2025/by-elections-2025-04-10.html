Four by-elections on 10th April 2025:
</p><p>
<h2>Sutton Central</h2>
</p><p>
Sutton council, London; caused by the disqualification of Liberal Democrat councillor David Bartolucci.
</p><p>
Last week's by-elections turned out to be all about the Liberal Democrats, who gained two seats from Labour in Lincoln and South Wales.  But they ended up losing the seat they were defending in Sutton, in St Helens.  So let's start this week's column by considering another Liberal Democrat defence, in a different Sutton.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/sutton-sutton-c-2025.png" alt="Sutton, Sutton C" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Located on the lower slopes of the North Downs, this Sutton is one of the commuter towns on the edge of London which boomed thanks to the opening of the railways, and which are now part of the urban sprawl of the Great Wen.  Sutton railway station has ten trains each hour to central London, via three different routes, and its importance to the town is demonstrated by its location at the southern end of Sutton's long pedestrianised High Street.  All of the High Street is part of Sutton Central ward, which also includes the council offices on Cheam Road; most of its residents live in housing to the east of the High Street.  Manor Park and the Benhill Recreation Ground are the only significant areas of green space here.
</p><p>
Sutton is one of the three boroughs of south-west London, along with Kingston upon Thames and Richmond upon Thames, which have been happy hunting grounds for the Liberal Democrats in recent decades.  But whereas Kingston and Richmond have swung back and forth between the Lib Dems and Tories over the years, Sutton has been consistently under Lib Dem majority control since 1990.  This is despite the fact that this is far more of a lower middle-class borough than Kingston and Richmond where the elites live.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2022/sutton22s.svgz" alt="Sutton, 2022" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
The Lib Dem majority on Sutton council has however slipped in recent years, and the 2022 elections here returned 29 Lib Dem councillors against 20 Conservatives, 3 Labour and 3 independents.  One of the Labour councillors resigned last year and the Conservatives gained the resulting by-election in St Helier West ward (<em>Andrew's Previews 2024</em>, forthcoming).
</p><p>
The start of the Lib Dem revival in south-west London can be dated to 1972, when Richard Sharples left his post as Conservative MP for Sutton and Cheam to become Governor of Bermuda and the Conservatives lost the resulting by-election to Liberal candidate Graham Tope.  Tope subsequently served as leader of Sutton council from 1986 to 1999, and he was still a councillor for Sutton Central ward up to 2014.  He was also a Lib Dem member of the London Assembly from 2000 to 2008, and he has sat in the House of Lords since 1994.
</p><p>
Lord Tope was elected to the London Assembly as a Londonwide member.  It took until 2024 for the Liberal Democrats to elect a constituency member of the London Assembly, partly because the Assembly boundaries split up their south-west stronghold.  Sutton is paired with the larger borough of Croydon, where the Liberal Democrats are very weak, and the Croydon and Sutton constituency consistently returns the Conservative candidate to City Hall.  Neil Garratt, the current AM for Croydon and Sutton, leads the Conservative group in the London Assembly and also sits on the opposition Conservative group on Sutton council.
</p><p>
Another Sutton councillor who also holds a higher elected office is Luke Taylor, who is a councillor for Sutton West and East Cheam ward.  Since 1972 the Sutton and Cheam constituency has swung back and forth between the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives, and it was a Lib Dem gain in the 2024 general election when Taylor was elected by a majority of 3,801 votes.  He is now the party's spokesperson for London.
</p><p>
Mind, the fall in Sutton council's Lib Dem majority in 2022 shows that not all is rosy here for the yellow team.  The party will now have to turn to defence in this by-election, which is to replace Lib Dem councillor David Bartolucci who had served since 2014.  Bartolucci had been deputy leader of the council until last year, but he then failed to get the top job after long-serving council leader Ruth Dombey stood down on health grounds.  It appears that Bartolucci basically stopped fulfilling his democratic duties after that, and he was automatically disqualified from the council last month for failing to turn up to any council meetings within the previous six months.  In 2022 the shares of the vote in Bartolucci's Sutton Central ward were 39% for the Lib Dems, 27% for Labour and 23% for the Conservatives.
</p><p>
Defending this seat for the Liberal Democrats is Choi Ka Yuen, as he is on the ballot paper, or Richard Choi as he is on the party's leaflets: Choi is a small business owner and entrepreneur who moved to Sutton from his native Hong Kong in 2008.  Returning from the 2022 election is Labour candidate Kerrie Peek.  We have a full set of BAME candidates from the main parties with the Conservatives nominating Maria Arif, who is a businesswoman.  Also standing are Peter Friel for the Greens, Joanna Bishop for Reform UK, Ashley Dickenson for the Christian Peoples Alliance and independent candidate Pamela Marsh, who is endorsed by the council's independent group.

<h2>St Ann's</h2>
</p><p>
Haringey council, London; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Tammy Hymas.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/haringey-st-anns-2025.png" alt="Haringey, St Ann's" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
This week's Labour defence in London is in a ward which this column previously visited on 6th October 2016 (<em>Andrew's Previews 2016</em>, page 223), although subsequent boundary changes mean that a lot of what I wrote then is out of date.  The St Ann's ward is named after St Ann's Road, which is its southern boundary; the road in turn is named after St Ann's church in South Tottenham, which was founded here in 1860 shortly before the area was consumed by the growth of London.  Chestnuts Park is now the only significant area of open space here.
</p><p>
St Ann's ward has a very diverse population, making the top 100 wards in England and Wales for residents born in Malta or Cyprus (1.4%), non-EU European countries (5.9%), or the Americas and the Caribbean (9.4%).  It also has a very high proportion of residents working in administration or support services (9.8%).
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2022/haringey22s.svgz" alt="Haringey, 2022" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
This is normally a safe Labour ward and it is part of the large Labour majority on Haringey council, but on previous boundaries in 2018 St Ann's turned in the best Green Party score of any ward in Haringey.  The Greens appear to have then put in a serious effort here in the 2022.election, with Labour eventually prevailing by the relatively narrow margin of 52-41.  The local MP, Foreign Secretary David Lammy, enjoyed a rather larger majority in 2024 in the Tottenham constituency which he has represented since 2000.
</p><p>
So this could be a tough defence for Labour following the resignation of Tammy Hymas, who had served since 2022 and was one of the few openly-transgender councillors in our town halls.  Hymas handed in her notice in February in protest at cuts to Haringey council's budget.
</p><p>
Defending this seat for Labour is Stephen Tawiah, who is a barrister specialising in immigration and asylum, housing and human rights law.  The Green Party have selected Ruairidh Paton, who is a former Momentum figure and has also been endorsed by the council's Independent Socialist Group of ex-Labour councillors.  Also standing are David Beacham for the Lib Dems, Tony Hunt for the Communist League, David Kaplan for the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition, Calum McGillivray for the Conservatives and David Stratford for Reform UK.

<h2>Teigl</h2>
</p><p>
Gwynedd council, North Wales; caused by the resignation of Plaid Cymru councillor Linda Jones.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/gwynedd-teigl-2025.png" alt="Gwynedd, Teigl" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
We now travel to the north, starting in Wild Wales.  The Teigl ward of Gwynedd is named after a minor river, which drains into the the Vale of Ffestiniog on its eastern side.  This river forms a National Park boundary, because Parc Cenedlaethol Eryri (that's the Snowdonia National Park for English speakers) surrounds the slate-mining town of Blaenau Ffestiniog but does not include it.
</p><p>
Blaenau Ffestiniog was not the first settlement here.  The Ffestiniog valley is relatively flat and suitable for agriculture, and the village of Llan Ffestiniog long predates the modern town to its north.  Other settlements here include Bont Newydd in the Cynfal valley, and Congl-y-wal on the road north to Blaenau.  All of these are linked together by the A470 trunk road, which takes a meandering route through the mountains from Cardiff to Llandudno.  Llan Ffestiniog lies within the National Park boundary so tourism is important here, and the waterfalls on the Afon Cynfal (which forms the southern boundary of this ward) are beauty spots.  Rhaeadr Cynfal is particularly impressive.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/rhaeadr-cynfal.jpg" alt="Rhaeadr Cynfal" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
However, the ward's 2021 census return indicates that tourism is not the only way in which Teigl ward's landscape is exploited.  Teigl ward has Wales' highest proportion of people employed in mining and quarrying, at 2.5%, and Wales' second-highest proportion of people employed in the electricity and gas sector.  Congl-y-wal still has active quarries, and the Ffestiniog valley and Maentwrog are home to large hydroelectric power plants; the Maentwrog scheme is fed from the Llyn Trawsfynydd reservoir, which was also home to Trawsfynydd nuclear power station until its closure in 1991.  (The railway line serving Trawsfynydd, which runs through Teigl ward, last saw a train in 1997 but is still officially classed as mothballed rather than closed.)  If we throw England into the mix, then Teigl ranks in the top 100 wards for lower supervisory and technical occupations (9.2%) and for the White British ethnic group (97.7%; the number of non-white residents here is in single figures).
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2022/gwynedd22s.svgz" alt="Gwynedd, 2022" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
This corner of what was once Merioneth is now administered from faraway Caernarfon by Gwynedd council.  This has a Plaid Cymru majority and its elections suffer badly from a lack of candidates: in the 2022 election 28 of Gwynedd's 69 councillors were elected without a contest, including Plaid Cymru veteran Linda Ann Jones in Teigl ward.  In fact, Jones hadn't faced a contest in this ward since 2004, when she crushed an independent candidate by 84-16.  She is now stepping down after 39 years of service in local government.  Plaid Cymru also represent this area (as part of the Dwyfor Meirionnydd constituency) in the two Parliaments: the party's Westminster group leader Liz Saville Roberts was re-elected for her fourth term of office last year, while Mabon ap Gwynfor MS is in his first term at Cardiff Bay: Mabon is Plaid's spokesman for health, social care and housing as well as being the party's chief whip.
</p><p>
The first contested election for Teigl ward in 21 years sees four candidates standing.  Defending for Plaid Cymru is Geraint Parry, who volunteers at Y Ganolfan in Blaenau and serves on the committee of the Pengwern Community Pub in Llan Ffestiniog.  He is up against independent candidate Marc Griffiths who represents part of this ward on Ffestiniog town council, Andrew Joyce for the Lib Dems and Hedd Thomas for the Conservatives.

<h2>Longdendale</h2>
</p><p>
Tameside council, Greater Manchester; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Jacqueline North.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/longdendale-local.jpg" alt="Local shop, Mottram" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Manchester and Sheffield are less than 40 miles apart, but the transport connections between them are appalling.  Yes, there is the small matter of the Pennines in the way, but that didn't stop the 20th-century builders of the motorway towards Leeds and Bradford.  Nor did it faze the railway navigators of an earlier era, who bored some of England's longest tunnels under the hills between the two cities.
</p><p>
But the most direct railway route from Manchester to Sheffield, via Longdendale and the Woodhead Tunnels, was closed by Beeching in favour of a more roundabout (and non-electrified) route via the Hope Valley.  The two main road links between the cities are both twisty single-carriageway roads which may be impassable in winter, and the Snake Pass road is now off-limits to HGVs due to serious problems with landslips in recent years.  That leaves the Woodhead Pass as the only transpennine trunk road between the M62 and the A50 Stoke-Derby road.  It is very heavily congested.
</p><p>
And nowhere has suffered from this congestion more than Mottram in Longdendale, a village which all traffic taking either the Woodhead or Snake Passes must travel through.  There was a plan in the 1970s to drive a motorway up Longdendale to either go over the Woodhead Pass, take over the now-disused railway tunnel, or some combination of the two.  The motorway was numbered M67, and it was completed in 1978 as far as the western edge of Mottram in Longdendale - where it terminates to this day, dumping all of its cars and lorries in a notorious queue towards the traffic lights in the middle of the village.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/longdendale-traffic.jpg" alt="Traffic (or lack of), Mottram" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
In my research trip I had intended to demonstrate this, but I had the misfortune to turn up on a day when the motorway was closed for bridge reconstruction works - while the Woodhead Pass was also closed because there had been another crash.  So you'll just have to imagine a line of traffic going back behind the camera as far as the eye can see.
</p><p>
The residents of Mottram in Longdendale, together with Hollingworth and Tintwistle further up the valley, are fed up of this and they have been campaigning for a bypass for decades.  And relief may now finally be in sight, with work just about to start on the Longdendale Bypass - which will take traffic out of Mottram, but not Hollingworth or Tintwistle.  It's a start.  The line of the route from the M67 roundabout has been marked out, and the start of construction appears to be imminent.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/tameside-longdendale-2025.png" alt="Tameside, Longdendale" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
The railway line closed by Beeching, meanwhile, still exists as a branch line as far as Hadfield and Glossop.  There are stations here at Broadbottom and Hattersley, with regular trains into Manchester - from where many of Longdendale ward's residents originated.  Hattersley was developed in the 1960s by Manchester city council as an overspill estate, and Longdendale ward still has large proportions of social housing as a result of that.  Although there isn't as much social housing as there used to be, partly because of Right to Buy and partly because some of the houses and tower blocks were built so poorly that they have since been demolished.
</p><p>
The houses on Wardle Brook Avenue in Hattersley mostly still stand today, but number 16 is missing.  That house was built in 1964 and its first residents were Ian Brady, Myra Hindley and Hindley's grandmother, their previous house in Gorton having been scheduled for slum clearance.  It was not known at the time that Brady and Hindley had already killed three people, and they went on to murder Lesley Ann Downey and Edward Evans at 16 Wardle Brook Avenue before police finally intercepted them.  Manchester city council subsequently demolished the house in the 1980s, because such was the address's association with the Moors Murderers that no tenant could be found who was willing to accept it.
</p><p>
In fact, there must be some curse that has been laid upon Mottram given the sheer number of serial killers who are associated with the place.  It was at another address in Mottram that the gangland murderer Dale Cregan lured two police officers to their deaths in 2012.  And Harold Shipman, then working as a GP in Hyde down the hill, was living in Mottram when he was arrested in 1998.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/longdendale-lowry-house.jpg" alt="The Elms, Mottram" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Even the famous resident of Mottram which the locals would prefer you to remember was ambivalent about the place.  In 1948 the artist L S Lowry moved to this house, The Elms on Stalybridge Road, and he remained there until his death in 1976.  But he never liked the house, and the village didn't fare much better in his opinion.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/lowry-mottram.jpg" alt="Agricultural Fair, Mottram in Longendale, 1949 - L S Lowry" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
<blockquote>
<em>"They're nice folk, I've nothing against them, it's the place never could take to it. I can't explain it. I've often wondered...It does nothing for me. I know there's plenty to paint here but I haven't the slightest desire to work locally. I've done one painting of the local agricultural show. Was commissioned to paint the parish church but had to give it up, I couldn't do it."</em>
</blockquote>
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/longdendale-church.jpg" alt="Mottram parish church" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Perhaps Lowry had a point as far as the parish church goes.  Dedicated to St Michael and All Angels, Mottram parish church has been here since at least the 13th century: the present structure dates from the end of the 15th century and its stones are blackened by hundreds of years of industrial pollution blowing here on the wind from Manchester.  The church's hilltop site is so exposed to the prevailing westerly wind that all of the gravestones in the churchyard lie flat.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/longdendale-sundial.jpg" alt="Sundial, Mottram" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Outside the churchyard is a mediaeval cross, which was restored for Victoria's Diamond Jubilee and gained a cubical sundial on its top.  Further down the hill a statue of Lowry has been erected next to the traffic lights, from where he can sketch the congestion.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/longdendale-lowry-statue.jpg" alt="Lowry statue, Mottram" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Mottram and Hollingworth were separate urban districts within Cheshire from the 19th century, before a local government review merged the two in 1936 to create the Longdendale Urban District - which, despite its name, only covered the western end of the valley.  (And only one half of the western end of the valley at that, because the River Etherow was - and in this area still is - the boundary with Derbyshire.)  In 1974 Longdendale Urban District became a single ward of Tameside council.
</p><p>
For decades this ward was the political fiefdom of Labour councillor (Samuel) Roy Oldham, who was a councillor for this ward from 1974 until his death in 2010 and was leader of Tameside council for nearly all of that time.  The presence of Hattersley meant that this was and still is normally a safe Labour ward, and in the history of Tameside Labour have only lost Longdendale ward once - to the Conservatives, back in 1975.  In May 2024 Labour enjoyed a 60-23 lead over the Conservatives here.
</p><p>
Two months later Labour MP Jonathan Reynolds was re-elected for his fifth term of office as the MP for Stalybridge and Hyde, and he subsequently joined the Cabinet with the difficult job of business and trade secretary.  Reynolds had been a councillor for Longdendale ward before entering the Commons, serving here from 2007 to 2011.  Reform UK were second to Reynolds in the Stalybridge and Hyde constituency last year, and the BNP and UKIP have previously polled good scores in Longdendale ward showing some potential here for the radical right.
</p><p>
Tameside council elections have a reputation for being rather boring, with only a handful of wards being capable of electing Conservative councillors and the rest - like Longdendale - normally being safe for Labour.  <!--><!-->This ward map, from 2023 when the current boundaries were introduced, is typical.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2023/tameside23s.svgz" alt="Tameside, 2023" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
However, Tameside Labour have run into a lot of trouble over the last year.  The May 2024 elections were rather poor for the party, with independent candidates gaining seats in St Peter's and Stalybridge North wards while Labour failed to gain the Conservative seat in the marginal Hyde Godley ward.  The Tories were defending a majority of 0 in that ward, having won the seat on the toss of a coin following a tied result.  In October 2024 the council leader Ged Cooney resigned, following a damning Ofsted report into the borough's children's services.
</p><p>
Then, in February, the <em>Mail on Sunday</em> revealed the existence of a WhatsApp group called "Trigger Me Timbers", the exposure of whose bad-taste messages led to the sacking of the Gorton and Denton MP Andrew Gwynne as a junior health minister.  Nine Tameside Labour councillors, including eight of the nine councillors for Denton, were members of the group and they are currently sitting as independent councillors with their party memberships suspended.  The former council leader Cooney has also lost the Labour whip over the matter.
</p><p>
In the meantime, two of Longdendale ward councillors have quit the Labour party.  First to go was Jacqueline North, who also resigned from the council in February after finding herself "fundamentally at odds with my political party on a number of fronts".  Then, earlier this month Gary Ferguson left Labour to become an independent in protest at welfare cuts.  This has left the ruling Labour group on Tameside council with 36 councillors plus this vacancy, against 13 independents and 7 Conservatives.
</p><p>
This by-election is to replace North, who was first elected in 2021 and was re-elected for a four-year term on new ward boundaries in 2023.  Trying to pick up the pieces is the defending Labour candidate Francesca Coates, who works for the BBC as a business and legal affairs manager: Coates was an unsuccessful Labour candidate in the last two Tameside elections, which included a tilt at the aforementioned Hyde Godley ward last year.  Kieron Wild, who was a rather distant runner-up here last year for the Conservatives, is back for another go.  Also standing are Amanda Hickling for the Green Party, Allan Hopwood for Reform UK and left-wing independent candidate Emma Leyla.
