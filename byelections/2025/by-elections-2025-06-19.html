<h2>Dowgate; and<br>
Vintry</h2>

City of London Court of Aldermen; caused respectively by the resignations of Aldermen Alison Gowman and Sir Andrew Parmley.

It's now back to our independent theme as we come to two elections for neighbouring wards in the ancient City of London.  These are for the City's Aldermen, who are technically elected for life but in practice are expected to seek re-election every six years.  This week we're going to consider two long-serving Aldermen who were first elected in the early 2000s and are both seeking their fifth terms of office.

One of these elections is over before it began, because when nominations closed nobody had stood against outgoing Alderwoman Alison Gowman who has represented Dowgate ward since 1991 - originally as a Common Councillor before transferring to the Aldermanic bench in 2002.  Gowman was appointed CBE in the 2024 Birthday Honours for "public and voluntary services and sustainability"; in her day job she is a commercial property consultant.  She was formally declared elected at yesterday's Wardmote for Dowgate ward, whcih is centred on Cannon Street railway station and runs south from Cannon Street to the riverbank.

Immediately to the west of Dowgate ward is Vintry ward, which as the name suggests was once the centre of London's wine trade.  The Worshipful Company of Vintners, one of the twelve great City livery companies, still has its hall here on Upper Thames Street opposite the church of St James Garlickhythe; the original Garlickhythe was a landing-place on the Thames where French garlic and wine was sold in mediaeval times, while the church was and indeed still is a stop for pilgrims on the route to Compostela in Spain.  Vintry ward extends north and west from here to take in Mansion House underground station and the <em>Financial Times</em> headquarters on Friday Street, while to the south the City's half of Southwark Bridge is within the ward boundary.

Here the outgoing Alderman is Sir Andrew Parmley, who was the 689th Lord Mayor of London in 2016-17 and was knighted in the following New Year Honours for services to music, education and civic engagement.  This column tends to write a lot about Aldermen who work in the City's traditional modern industries of banking and finance, insurance and/or the law; but Parmley has combined his democratic duties with a career in education and music: he is the director of the Royal College of Organists, and he can still be found from time to time at the organ console of St James Garlickhythe.

Parmley is seeking re-election for a fourth term.  He is challenged by three other candidates: Sarah Loveday is a senior HR consultant who has tried to become an Alderman before (she stood in Bread Street ward in 2023); Alpa Raja is an accountant with a number of failed City election campaigns behind her, who has previously served as a Common Councilwoman for Castle Baynard ward from 2022 until she lost her seat earlier this year; and Paul Singh was elected in 2022 as a Common Councilman for Cripplegate ward before similarly losing re-election in Castle Baynard in March 2025.  As this is the City of London, all the candidates are standing as independents.

<h2>Buckingham</h2>

Adur council, West Sussex; caused by the death of Labour councillor Nigel Jenner.

We finish for the week in England's first local government district, as listed alphabetically.  Adur takes its name from a Sussex river which floes into the seat at Shoreham, between Brighton and Worthing.  Here we find Buckingham ward, which covers the north of Shoreham around the Buckingham Park recreational ground, together with a large section of the South Downs National Park to the north of the A27 Shoreham bypass.  Buckingham ward is one of the better-off parts of Shoreham, with high rates of owner-occupation and part-time working.

Shoreham is the main town in the small Adur district.  The current ward boundaries here date from 2004, and since then Adur has been one of the few local government districts which elects half of its councillors every two year.  The council had had a Conservative majority since 2002, and Buckingham ward was very much part of that majority to the extent that nobody opposed the Conservatives here in the 2006 election.

Adur council shares a chief executive and a large number of its services with the neighbouring Worthing council, where the Labour party came from nothing in May 2017 to win overall control in 2022.  The 2022 local elections also saw Labour top the poll across Adur district for the first time, although an unfavourable vote distibution meant that the 14 Adur council seats up for election that year split seven to the Conservatives, five to Labour and one each to the Green Party and an independent councillor (who was not opposed by the Conservatives).

A repeat of that result would have delivered no overall control on Adur council in 2024.  In fact, the Conservative vote here completely collapsed that year: from an overall majority, the Tories held only one seat and it wasn't Buckingham ward.  In a result completely out of kilter with everything that had gone before, Labour won 13 out of 16 seats up for election here last year, and took overall control of Adur council for the very first time.  Buckingham ward, which had voted over 50% Conservative at every local election up to 2018, finished with a Labour lead over the Conservatives of 51-32.

Labour followed up on this result two months later by gaining the East Worthing and Shoreham parliamentary seat from the Conservatives; the local MP Tom Rutland had been so confident of victory that he had resigned his Lambeth council before being elected to the Commons.  The Conservatives do still hold all of Adur's seats on West Sussex county council, but at the last election in 2021 they only narrowly held the Shoreham North division which covers Buckingham ward.

The Labour candidate who won Buckingham ward in 2024 was (Arthur) Nigel Jenner, who came to politics from a long career working in youth serivces for East Sussex county council and then for Brighton and Hove council; his last role before retirement was working with inmates leaving Lewes prison.  He passed away in April, eleven months after joining the council.

Nigel Jenner's partner Kate Davis is trying to take over his old seat as the defending Labour candidate in this by-election: she is also retired from a career in public service, and she is a governor at a local primary school.  Davis was one of the few unsuccessful Labour candidates in last year's Adur election, when she contested Shoreham's Marine ward.  The Conservatives' Leila Williams, a senior manager in the NHS, previously appeared in this column in December 2021 when she won a by-election in the neighbouring Hillside ward; in 2022 Williams attempted to transfer to Southwick Green ward but she was defeated, and she went on to be the Conservatives' losing Parliamentary candidate in East Worthing and Shoreham last year.  Also standing are Ian Jones for the Lib Dems, David Bamber for Britain First and a candidate who is notable enough for Wikipedia.  Mike Mendoza is best known to the outside world as a radio presenter - he did overnight shows for Talksport from 2004 to 2008 - but he has a long political career in Sussex, having previously been elected to the old Hove council as a Conservative and to Adur council both as an independent and as a Conservative candidate.  In this by-election Mendoza has the Reform UK nomination.
