<h2>Glen</h2>

Harborough council, Leicestershire; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor James Hallam.

For our other by-election today we travel to the Leicestershire countryside.  The Glen ward of Harborough district covers seven parishes just to the south-east of Leicester's built-up area, but the vast majority of its electors live in the village of Great Glen which has been bypassed by the main road towards Market Harborough.  Great Glen lies in the valley of the River Sence and the Glen in the name has the same "valley" meaning as the glens of Scotland, reflecting that this is an old settlement with a Celtic name.

Glen ward is home to the prestigious Leicester Grammar School, a fee-paying school which was founded in 1981 and moved here in 2008 from the city centre.  The Leicester Grammar School has produced a number of Leicseter Tigers rugby players over the years, and former pupil Harry Ellis - a scrum-half who won 27 caps for England and one for the Lions in the 2000s - now teaches PE here.  This is not a boarding school, but nonetheless Glen ward has a rather young age profile to go with its professional commuter demographic.  Great Glen has also had lots of new houses built in this century, which will also reduce its age profile.

It's places like Great Glen which have been decisive in ensuring that the Harborough, Oadby and Wigston constituency (which was renamed from "Harborough" in 2024) has been in Conservative hands since 1950.  Partly this is to do with the fact that this parliamentary seat includes the Oadby and Wigston borough which has run by the Liberal Democrats for decades, and until the Coalition years the Lib Dems would normally poll decent vote shares in Harborough without ever winning.  Labour took over second place here in 2015, and they came within 3,000 votes of unseating Conservative backbencher Neil O'Brien last year.  O'Brien weathered the storm and was re-elected for a third term of office, and he recently joined the Conservative frontbench as a shadow education minister.

Local election results show that Great Glen is clearly in the Conservative column.  In the 2023 Harborough council elections the Tory slate enjoyed a 57-29 lead over the Liberal Democrats in Glen ward - but this wasn't enough to stop the Conservatives losing their majority on Harborough council, which now has a traffic-light coalition under a Lib Dem leader.  The ward is part of the Gartree division of Leicestershire county council, which was very safely Conservative when it was last contested in 2021; the Gartree name refers to an ancient hundred or wapentake of Leicestershire, which covered a similar area to the modern Harborough district.

This by-election is to replace James Hallam, who had served as a Conservative councillor here for 14 years since his first election in 2011; his local government career peaked in 2019-23 when he was deputy leader of the council.  Defending this seat for the Conservatives is Peter Scott, who is a Great Glen parish councillor.  The Lib Dems have selected Chrisotpher Graves, who contested the neighbouring Kibworths ward (where he lives) in 2023.  Also on the ballot are candidates from two parties who didn't stand here in 2023, Robin Lambert for the continuing SDP and Andy Thomas for Labour.
