Four by-elections on 24th April 2025:
</p><p>
<h2>Glenrothes Central and Thornton</h2>
</p><p>
Fife council, Scotland; caused by the death of Scottish National Party councillor Ross Vettraino.
</p><p>
There is just a week to go to the ordinary local elections in England, and Andrew's Previews will have the usual set of goodies ready for you next week.  (If I finish writing it in time.)  But Scotland is having a fallow year in election terms: the next ordinary order of business here will be the Holyrood elections in May 2026.  So, north of the Border, it's by-elections all the way for the next 12 months.
</p><p>

</p><p>
A month ago, the death was announced of a Scottish painter whose work has divided the art world.  Jack Vettriano grew up in Fife, briefly worked at the pit in Methilhill, then taught himself to paint and achieved huge commercial success in his lifetime.  His 1992 work <em>The Singing Butler</em>, shown above, is the UK's most popular painting in terms of prints sold, and its original was sold at auction in 2004 for Â£744,500.  But Vettriano had been turned down for a place to study fine art at Edinburgh University, <em>The Singing Butler</em> was rejected by the Royal Academy when it was submitted to its 1992 summer exhibition, and critical reaction to Vettriano's art has often been negative.  His work is definitely one of those cases where critical and popular tastes do not align.
</p><p>
Jack Vettriano's death came just a couple of weeks after the passing of another Fife man with a very similar name, who was also an OBE.  Ross Vettraino had spent his career in local government, originally at North East Fife district council where he rose to become head of Environmental Services: his honour came in 1990 for services to environmental health.  After retiring from work at Scotland's local government reorganisation in 1996, Vettraino went into elected politics and since 2007 he had been a Scottish National Party member of Fife council.  He was well-thought of enough that in 2023 he was shortlisted for the "Lifetime Legend" category at the Local Government Information Unit's "Councillor of the Year" awards.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/fife-glenrothes-c-thornton-2025.png" alt="Fife, Glenrothes C/Thornton" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Ross Vettraino's ward was Glenrothes Central and Thornton, which is one of three Fife wards covering the New Town of Glenrothes and its hinterland.  This ward covers the central shopping area and the south-eastern quadrant of the town, together with the railway station at Glenrothes with Thornton.  (Which is in Thornton, not Glenrothes.)
</p><p>
Glenrothes is the basis for a constituency in both the Westminster and Holyrood Parliaments. The Westminster seat, called "Glenrothes and Mid Fife", is one of many Scottish constituencies which Labour gained from the Scottish National Party nine months ago.  The Labour MP Richard Baker started his political career in 2003 when he was elected to the Holyrood parliament as a regional MSP for North East Scotland; his wife Claire still sits in the Scottish Parliament, where she has held a regional seat for Mid Scotland and Fife since 2007.  Richard had resigned from Holyrood in 2016 to take up a job with Age Scotland.  He gained his seat in 2024 from the SNP's Peter Grant.
</p><p>
Grant, a former leader of Fife council, had served as an MP since 2015.  He had previously been the SNP candidate in the November 2008 Glenrothes Westminster by-election, losing on that occasion to Labour's Lindsay Roy.  Shortly after this by-election the SNP campaign asked the sheriff court for a copy of the marked register - the copies of the electoral roll used for the by-election which had been marked by the poll staff to show who had voted and who had not, which the returning officer had sent to the sheriff court for safekeeping.  The SNP were entitled to do this and this sort of request is normally routine - but not on this occasion.  The marked register could not be found, and after ten weeks of searching the courts had to admit the register had been lost: a subsequent enquiry found that the election documents had last been seen in an insecure room at the Kirkcaldy sheriff court.  In the end the House of Commons had to order that the ballot papers from the by-election be taken out of storage and re-examined, because there was no other way of reconstructing the marked register.
</p><p>
Continuing the theme of very similar names, the Glenrothes and Mid Fife Westminster seat has similar boundaries to the Mid Fife and Glenrothes Holyrood seat.  This has been represented since 2016 by the SNP's Jenny Gilruth, who is currently in the Scottish Cabinet as education and skills secretary.  Like Richard Baker MP, Gilruth also has a a partner who is a political figure, on this occasion from across the party divide: she is married to Kezia Dugdale, the former Scottish Labour leader.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2022/fife22s.svgz" alt="Fife, 2022" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
In local elections the SNP normally have the upper hand in Glenrothes Central and Thornton, and since 2017 the ward has had two SNP councillors and one Labour.  First preferences here in 2022 were 49% for the SNP, 28% for Labour and 12% for the Conservatives; on a two-party preferred basis, the SNP would have beaten Labour 56-44.
</p><p>
So the new SNP candidate Lynda Holton, who works on the party's parliamentary staff, can be fairly confident of holding this seat.  The Labour candidate Maciej Dokurno is chair of Polski MOST, the Polish Association in Scotland, and he is an advisor to the Polish Senate on matters relating to the Polish diaspora.  Standing for the Conservatives is Fiona Leslie, who works for a major telecoms provider.  Ed Scotcher for the Lib Dems and Ian Smith for Reform UK complete a ballot paper of five candidates.  Votes at 16 and the Alternative Vote apply here.

<h2>Thatcham North East</h2>
</p><p>
West Berkshire council; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Lee Dillon.
</p><p>
Our remaining three by-elections today are in parts of southern and eastern English where no local elections are taking place in May.  In the case of West Berkshire, that's because Berkshire county council was abolished back in the 1990s and its services were transferred to the district councils: in the process, Newbury council was renamed as West Berkshire.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/w-berks-thatcham-ne-2025.png" alt="W Berks, Thatcham NE" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
West Berkshire district covers some western suburbs of Reading, but its core is the town of Newbury and its eastern satellite town of Thatcham.  Thatcham North East ward is one of four wards covering Thatcham: it lies to the north of the A4 road, and it takes in some recent development which is clearly part of Thatcham but has overspilled into the neighbouring Cold Ash parish.
</p><p>
On its reconstitution in 1998 West Berkshire council was run by the Liberal Democrats, but the council fell into no overall control after the 2003 local elections resulted in a 26-26 tie between the Lib Dems and the Conservatives.  The Lib Dems initially kept control on the mayoral casting vote, but in 2005 the Conservatives came to power in May 2005 after they gained a by-election in Thatcham North, the predecessor to this ward, by 175 votes.  On the same day the Conservatives gained the Newbury parliamentary seat from David Rendel, who had won a parliamentary by-election in 1993.
</p><p>
Rendel returned to elected office in 2007, as one of the two councillors for Thatcham North ward along with a young man called Lee Dillon.  They both retired in 2011, but Dillon returned in 2015 as one of only four Liberal Democrat councillors in West Berkshire - on that occasion gaining his seat from the Conservatives.  He transferred to Thatcham North East following boundary changes in 2019, and that ward is now safe for the Liberal Democrats.  In 2023 Thatcham North East voted 56% for the Lib Dems and 25% for the Conservatives.
</p><p>
The Liberal Democrats won overall control of West Berkshire council in 2023, and Lee Dillon became leader of the council.  His political rise then continued the following year when he was elected as Lib Dem MP for Newbury, gaining that seat from the Conservatives.  There are no scheduled elections here now until the next West Berkshire council elections in 2027, so Dillon had to force a by-election at some point if he was going to give up his council seat.
</p><p>
Defending this seat for the Liberal Democrats is Tom McCann, who is the leader of Thatcham town council and is a trustee of two asthma charities; according to the party website, he is "almost retired" after a career in the construction industry, and he has previous local government experience as a Wokingham councillor from 2012 to 2016.  The Conservatives' Dominic Parry, who was an unsuccessful candidate here in 2023, is trying again.  Also standing on an all-male ballot paper are Michael Wakelyn-Green for the Green Party, Lee Allen for Labour and James Stokes for Reform UK.

<h2>Marine</h2>
</p><p>
Arun council, West Sussex; caused by the death of independent councillor Jim Brooks.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/arun-marine-2025.png" alt="Arun, Marine" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
First, let's make sure we have the right Marine ward because there are three of them in West Sussex.  This is the western of the three, the town centre ward for what is claimed to be the sunniest town in Britain.  Bognor Regis was developed into a resort in the eighteenth century by the property developer Sir Richard Hotham, whose name is commemorated by an electoral ward elsewhere in the town.
</p><p>
As with many seaside resorts, the town centre is a deprived area.  It has a very unusual demographic for south-east England outside London, with high levels of immigration from eastern Europe.  Arun Marine ward has the highest population of people born in the EU 2004 eastern expansion states of any ward in the south-east outside London (14.3%) and makes the top 30 wards for that statistic across England and Wales.  It just sneaks into the top 100 wards in England and Wales for private renting (49.8% of households), and it has unusually high levels of people employed in manufacturing by regional standards (12.2%).
</p><p>
This working-class ward in Bognor town centre had been represented from 2007 until his death in January by independent councillor Jim Brooks, who was mayor of Bognor Regis in 2011-12.  Brooks was a Welshman by birth who came to Bognor in 1960 when his parents became the first children's entertainers at the Butlins holiday camp in Bognor Regis, and he went into the family business as a clown, musician and singer.  Brooks had a large personal vote in Marine ward, and the political parties normally ran only one candidate for the ward's two seats - this usually means they did not believe they could unseat him.
</p><p>
For many years Brooks' fellow ward councillor was Conservative Dougal Maconachie, who died in office at the end of 2017.  The resulting by-election in February 2018 returned Matt Stanley of the Lib Dems, who has represented the ward ever since.  Topline vote shares here in 2023 were 37% for Brooks, 26% for the Liberal Democrats and 20% for Labour.  Arun council is run by a rainbow coalition of anti-Conservative councillors.
</p><p>
But this corner of Sussex by the sea votes Conservative at other levels of government.  In the 2021 West Sussex county council elections Matt Stanley was runner-up to the Conservatives in the local Bognor Regis West and Aldwick division; the 2025 West Sussex county council elections have been postponed to next year.  In July 2024 the Bognor Regis and Littlehampton constituency returned the Conservative candidate Alison Griffiths, who is one of the relatively small intake of new Conservative MPs: she took the seat over from long-serving MP Nick Gibb, who was schools minister for nearly all of the preceding 14 years of Conservative or Coalition government.
</p><p>
One new independent candidate has come forward to succeed the late Jim Brooks: Phil Woodall is a Bognor Regis town councillor who served as mayor of the town in 2017-18.  Another town councillor on the ballot is the Lib Dems' Paul Wells, who was previously an Arun councillor from a March 2013 by-election (in Aldwick East ward) until he stood down in 2019.  Labour have selected Alison Terry, who comes to politics from a career in engineering and maths teaching.  Also on the ballot are Diana Thas for the Conservatives, John Erskine for the Greens and Giuliano Pinnelli for Reform UK.

<h2>St John's</h2>
</p><p>
Suffolk county council; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Sarah Adams.
</p><p>
Our last poll before the 2025 local elections is an election that, a year ago, would not have happened.  This is a poll to Suffolk county council, whose 2025 elections have been postponed to 2026 pending local government reorganisation.  That postponement was decided on quite late in the day, and the ministerial order implementing it was made on 10th February this year.
</p><p>
By this point, the six-month rule had already come into effect meaning that no by-elections would be held for any more vacant seats if the councillor's term was due to end in May 2025.  In previous bouts of local government reorganisation there has been some confusion over what to do when the six-month rule applies to a vacancy but the ordinary election subsequently gets postponed, so the Local Authorities (Changes to Years of Ordinary Elections) (England) Order 2025 made explicit provision for this.  In the nine areas it applies to (East Sussex, Essex, Hampshire, the Isle of Wight, Norfolk, Suffolk, Surrey, Thurrock and West Sussex) any vacant seats which has previously been subject to the six-month rule would have to go to by-elections on or before 1st May 2025.  At the time there were three vacancies this provision applied to: two (in the Isle of Wight and Thurrock) will poll next week, and this is the other.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/suffolk-cc-st-johns-2025.png" alt="Suffolk CC, St John's" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
The St John's county division lies in the east of Suffolk's county town, Ipswich.  This is an entirely built-up area along Spring Road and Foxhall Road, lying between the Felixstowe railway line (whose Derby Road station is on the division boundary) and the Ipswich Hospital.  Much of the division's housing was laid out in Victorian times by the Freehold Land Society, forerunners of the Ipswich Building Society, which bought the Cauldwell Hall estate for housing in 1849; because of the rush to speculate the area became known as California, after the gold rush of that year, and it still bears that name today.  The census return for the St John's ward of Ipswich borough council (which has somewhat different boundaries) suggest that the ward has a mixed demographic profile with high employment levels.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/suffolk21s.svgz" alt="Suffolk CC, 2021" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
This division was represented on Suffolk county council for over 20 years by Labour councillor Sandy Martin, until he was elected to Parliament in June 2017 as the Labour MP for Ipswich.  Not realising that he would lose that seat a couple of years later, Martin then tendered his resignation from Suffolk county council and the resulting by-election was won by Labour candidate Sarah Adams: she made a quick return to the county council, having lost her previous seat in St Margaret's and Westgate division to the Conservatives four months previously.  In 2021 Adams was re-elected for a second term with a 48-39 lead over the Conservatives, and she later became leader of the county council's Labour group.  Subsequent results in the Ipswich council wards of St John's and Alexandra have shown larger leads for Labour; and the Ipswich constituency now has a Labour MP again, Jack Abbott.
</p><p>
Defending this by-election for Labour is Adele Cook, a public sector lawyer whose husband John is one of the borough councillors for Alexandra ward.  The Conservatives' James Harding, who stood in the 2017 by-election here when he was just 18 years old, is trying again in this by-election with a few more years of experience under his belt.  Also standing are Adria Pittock for the Green Party, Kelly Turner for the Liberal Democrats and Michelle Bevan-Margetts for Reform UK.
