Six by-elections on 9th October 2025:
</p><p>
<h2>Skelton East</h2>
</p><p>
<em>Redcar and Cleveland council, North Yorkshire; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Andy Oliver.</em>
</p><p>
We're going to start today's Previews in a small town on the northern slopes of the North York Moors.  The name of Skelton-in-Cleveland refers to that location: Skelton is derived from Old English wards for a settlement on a shelf of land, while Cleveland is a generic name - referring to the sea cliffs on the coast here - for the area between the North York Moors and the North Sea or Tees estuary.  The name "Cleveland" was subsequently hijacked for a short-lived county which also included parts of County Durham like Stockton and Hartlepool: this was a bad decision which made a lot of people very unhappy and the county has now been defunct for longer than it existed, although Cleveland Police still use its old boundaries.
</p><p>
In the 2021 census Skelton East made the top 40 wards in England and Wales for White British population (97.9%), the top 50 wards for residents born in the UK (98.1%), the top 90 wards for lower supervisory and technical occupations (8.9%) and the top 20 wards for residents employed in mining or quarrying (2.6%).  The latter two statistics are driven by the massive Boulby Mine a few miles to the east of Skelton, which extracts potash and polyhalite from the ground and exports it by rail on a freight-only line though this ward.  Skelton's geology is different: the village lies on high-quality deposits of ironstone, which fuelled the development of the Teesside iron industry in the 19th century.  Without that industry, the town of Middlesbrough would not exist.
</p><p>
Skelton East ward covers the eastern end of Skelton town together with a village to the south-east called North Skelton.  Now why should North Skelton be south-east of the town it is named after?  Well, the answer to this is that it is a reference to the North Skelton Mine, which operated from 1872 to 1964 and was the deepest of Cleveland's ironstone mines.  The North Skelton Mine's developers had at first wanted to sink the mineshafts further north, but the geological surveys revealed that there was more ironstone to the south-east of Skelton than at the originally-intended location.  Despite this nobody ever bothered to change the mine's name, and the village of North Skelton was built by and named after the mine rather than its actual location.  There are still streets in North Skelton named after the mine's original partners Henry Bolckow (who was the first MP for Middlesbrough) and John Vaughan, and at the start of the 20th century their firm Bolckow, Vaughan and Company was one of the world's largest producers of pig iron.
</p><p>
During this time the local authority here was Skelton and Brotton Urban District Council, under the North Riding County Council based in Northallerton.  By the 1930s, with the mine still in operation but not as profitable or productive as it used to be, a number of your column's ancestors decided to get into local politics here by standing for election to the UDC.  My great-great-grandfather George Teale finished in third place in Stanghow ward in April 1932 and in second place in Boosbeck ward in April 1935 before eventually making it onto the council: we've not yet tracked down his winning result, but newspaper reports from 1938 and 1939 show him as a councillor.  George had previously worked on the North Eastern Railway as a signalman, and in the 1930s he was running the Commercial Hotel in Boosbeck, a village to the south of Skelton which is now part of Skelton West ward.  He was an independent candidate but family lore has it that his politics were basically Liberal.  We think he's standing in the doorway of the Commercial in this old photograph.
</p><p>
<img src="http://www.image-archive.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/343-1-1536x898.jpg">
</p><p>
Two of George Teale's many sons also stood for election.  Robert Henry Teale (my great-grandfather) finished a close second in a June 1931 by-election in Stanghow ward, while Arthur Teale (who ran the Duke William in Skelton) had stood unsuccessfully in Old Skelton ward in an October 1939 by-election.  His election address is worth quoting in full, as while many parts of it could be used today without alteration the final sentence shows some of the difficulties of holding an election during the Second World War:
</p><p>
<blockquote>
I believe in the virtue of economy, but economy that goes side by side with progress. Sometimes wise spending rather than stinting, is the truest economy. This specially applies to our ward at the present time, for we need now as we have never needed before, someone who has your true interest at heart and is not dependent on others for a lead but who is not afraid to tackle the various questions arising from our present circumstances in a manner which will work to our mutual advantage.
</p><p>
I am tied to no party or organisation, and my voting power on the council will, therefore, be absolutely free to be used for the benefit of the ward. If I am elected I shall always endeavour to work for our mutual good and on completing my term of Office shall again offer myself knowing I have done my utmost.
</p><p>
Vote early on account of the blackout and bring your gas mask.
</blockquote>
</p><p>
These days party politics have muscled into elections of Redcar and Cleveland council, although independents are still a major part of the present council.  Redcar and Cleveland regularly returns hung councils and has had some fragmented election results in recent years: for example, the most recent election in 2023 returned 23 Labour councillors, 13 independents, 12 Conservatives and 11 Lib Dems.  A Labour minority administration is in place.
</p><p>
Fragmentation has been a theme in national politics recently as well, but Skelton is part of the Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland constituency which bucked that trend in 2024 and turned into a polarised and very close Conservative versus Labour fight.  One major factor in this is that the defending Conservative MP in 2024 was arch-Brexiteer Sir Simon Clarke, and Reform UK did not field a candidate against him as part of an electoral pact with the SDP - whose candidate, the journalist Rod Liddle, lost his deposit.
</p><p>
Despite this Clarke lost his seat last year, by 214 votes, to Labour candidate Luke Myer.  Myer had been elected to the council the previous year in Longbeck ward, in a result where the losing Conservative candidates were the previous Conservative group leader Andrea Turner and her husband, the then Cleveland police and commissioner Steve Turner.  Andrea eventually lost her seat by four votes after four recounts, having sufficiently spat her dummy out at the returning officer that the count had to be adjourned and the Longbeck ward result was not declared until five days after polling.  Luke Myer resigned from Redcar and Cleveland council after his election to the House of Commons, and the Conservatives - but not Andrea Turner - gained the resulting Longbeck by-election in September 2024.
</p><p>
This is the second by-election of the current Redcar and Cleveland council term, and this time the Conservatives are on the defensive.  Skelton East ward was created in 2019 when population growth resulted in the previous three-seat Skelton ward being split up, and while the old Skelton ward was Labour-inclined the two elections in Skelton East to date have been safely Conservative.  Vote shares here in 2023 were 42% for the Conservatives, 32% for Labour and 23% for an independent slate associated with outgoing Conservative councillor Julie Craig (who attempted to transfer to Skelton West, without success).  All 970 people who voted in Skelton East two years ago got it right: not a single ballot paper was ruled invalid.  The outgoing councillor Andy Oliver, who was midway through his first term, is a businessman who runs an indoor crazy golf course in the ward; he is standing down from the council to concentrate on other interests.
</p><p>
Defending for the Conservatives is Julie Craig, who was previously a councillor for this ward from 2019 to 2023 as stated above; it would appear that she is now back in the Tory fold.  Labour have reselected Norman Macleod, an RAF veteran who previously stood here in 2023 and is trying again.  The independents from last time have not returned so a fair number of votes are up for grabs: hoping to pick up some or more of them are the Lib Dems' Stuart Saunders and Reform UK's Craig Holmes, a former Conservative councillor for Skelton West who lost his seat in 2023.

<h2>Aughton and Holborn</h2>
</p><p>
<em>West Lancashire council; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Kerry Lloyd.</em>
</p><p>
Would you like to eat some exceptionally good food?  Well, if you take the Merseyrail train to Town Green station, on the Ormskirk branch of the Northern Line, then you'll be spoiled for choice.  Within easy walking distance of the station you will find three restaurants with a total of five Michelin stars between them: the three-starred Moor Hall on the edge of town, its one-star next-door neighbour The Barn, and the one-starred sō-lō closer to the railway.
</p><p>
All this fine dining means that the Lancashire parish of Aughton has taken the world record previously held by Kyoto for most Michelin-starred restaurants per head of population.  Aughton is effectively a southern extension of Ormskirk, on the main road and railway line towards Liverpool, which is served by Town Green and Aughton Park railway stations.  The Holborn part of the ward name refers to a small corner of the ward in Ormskirk proper, around the part of the main road known as Holborn Hill.
</p><p>
This ward was drawn up in 2023 as an expanded version of the old Aughton Park ward, with the Town Green area added from the old Aughton and Downholland ward and the Holborn area of Ormskirk added from Knowsley ward.  In the 2021 census Aughton Park ranked 10th of all the wards in England and Wales for Christianity (72.4%), which is a general feature of the census return for north-west England: all of the top 18 Christian wards are in Lancashire or Merseyside.  It was also ranked in the top 80 wards for lower managerial, administrative and professional occupations (28.1% of the workforce) and in the top 90 wards for owner-occupation (88.2%).  The former Aughton with Downholland ward also had a clear Liverpool commuter demographic, if not quite as strong as Aughton Park, and it was in the top 25 wards for Christianity.
</p><p>
Aughton may have L postcodes for Liverpool, but it lies outside Merseyside and the local authority is West Lancashire council, which is based in Ormskirk and also takes in the New Town of Skelmersdale and a large rural area.  Historically West Lancashire has had extremely polarised local election voting patterns, with most wards being either very safe Labour or very safe Conservative with very little in between.  The council has been under Labour leadership since 2015, although not always with a majority: some recent defection losses have left Labour in a minority on West Lancashire council with 21 seats plus this vacancy against 14 Conservatives, 2 independents, 1 recent defector from Labour to Jeremy Corbyn's new group Your Party, and 6 OWLs.  The OWLs are not what they seem: the initials stand for Our West Lancashire, which is a localist party focused on Ormskirk.
</p><p>
Aughton's commuter demographic meant that the predecessor wards were normally safe Conservative, and in 2007 the Conservatives polled 81% of the vote in Aughton Park and 77% in Aughton and Downholland.  But by 2022 the general anti-Conservative swing in greater Merseyside combined with the unpopularity of the government to produce Labour's only win in Aughton and Downholland (by 50.8-49.2) and cut the Tory majority in Aughton Park to 48-44.  When Aughton and Holborn ward was first contested in 2023, it narrowly returned the Labour slate by 54-46.  Then in 2024 Our West Lancashire contested the ward for the first time, and they took second place as the Conservative collapsed: vote shares were 41% for Labour, 25% for the Conservatives and 24% for Labour.
</p><p>
The Lancashire county divisions are still based on the old ward pattern, and that has left Aughton and Holborn ward split between three county divisions.  Most of the ward is within West Lancashire West, which Reform UK gained from the Conservatives in May; while Holborn and the area around Aughton Park railway station are respectively in the Ormskirk and West Lancashire East divisions, which both returned OWL county councillors.
</p><p>
The West Lancashire parliamentary seat is slightly smaller and more Labour-inclined than the district, and it has had only Labour MPs since 1992.  The current MP here is Ashley Dalton, who won a by-election in February 2023 after the seat's previous MP Rosie Cooper resigned to become chair of the Mersey Care NHS foundation trust.  Dalton made it to the frontbench earlier this year as a junior health minister - something which is relevant to her own life, as she has been diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer.
</p><p>
Ashley Dalton first became aware of the Labour Party when she was working as a child in her father's florist's shop and an order was received for 40 red rose buttonholes for a by-election count.  One wonders whether the West Lancashire branch of the party have made similar arrangements for tonight's count to elect a replacement for Kerry Lloyd.  Lloyd was first elected for this ward in 2023 and re-elected for a four-year term in May 2024, but she quit the Labour party shortly afterwards in a row over a council proposal (which was eventually rejected) to close a swimming pool in Ormskirk.  She has now stood down as a councillor.
</p><p>
Labour will want their seat back and they have selected Karl Taraldsen, an Army veteran who helps people who are out of work to start their own businesses; he also managed the largest solar panel scheme ever delivered in West Lancashire.  Our West Lancashire have reselected Gordon Johnson, a football referee, retired policeman and former mayor of West Lancashire who was runner-up here last year; Johnson was elected in May as the county councillor for Ormskirk, and he now has the chance to return to West Lancashire council after losing his seat in 2023.  On both of those occasions Johnson finished ahead of the Conservatives' Bruce Porteous, who has some professional experience of painful outcomes: he is a dentist.  Reform UK's Aaron Body, who has a number of previous contests as an independent or localist candidate in Skelmersdale under his belt, is also standing as are Charlotte Houltram for the Greens and Peter Chandler for the Lib Dems.

<h2>Lloyds and Corby Village</h2>
</p><p>
<em>North Northamptonshire council; caused by the resignation of Reform UK councillor Robert Bloom.</em>
</p><p>
We have a by-election defence this week for those new kids on the electoral block Reform UK, which comes in a town that this year is celebrating the 75th anniversary of its rebirth as a New Town.  But Corby is in fact an old town, and next year will mark the 800th anniversary of the granting of its original market charter by Henry III.
</p><p>
We touched earlier on the development of the Teesside steel industry thanks to the large ironstone deposits in Cleveland.  North Northamptonshire has similar geology but the development of Corby took longer to get going: in the 1931 census Corby had a population of around 1,500 and an economy based on the Stewarts and Lloyds ironstone site.  Shortly afterwards Stewarts and Lloyds started work to build a large steelworks, allowing the local iron ore to be fed straight into the furnaces without having to leave the site: this development quickly came on stream, with the decision being made in November 1932 and the first blast furnace being lit in May 1934.  The jobs available at Corby quickly attracted a large immigrant population from Scotland where the steel industry was in decline, and by 1939 when Corby became an Urban District its population had boomed to around 12,000.  Once the war was over, Corby was designated as a New Town in 1950 to allow further population growth.
</p><p>
Today Corby is the seat of North Northamptonshire council, which covers a large rural area in the east of the county together with the towns of Corby, Kettering and Wellingborough.  There is also now a Corby town council, established in 2021 to cover the previously-unparished New Town area.
</p><p>
The town council area is divided into four North Northamptonshire wards, of which Lloyds and Corby Village is the north-eastern one.  Here we find housing on the eastern fringe of the New Town, Corby's railway station (which was opened in 2009 and now has two hourly trains to London), the original Corby village, and all of the steelworks site.  Steel production at Corby ended in 1980 leading to major unemployment in the town, but Tata Steel still have a plant here which makes steel tubes with material from South Wales.  Much of the old site has been redeveloped for other industrial uses, and a large number of distribution warehouses have sprung up here.
</p><p>
The 2021 census was taken on the basis of the old Northamptonshire county divisions, which were used as temporary wards for the 2021 North Northamptonshire elections.  In 2021 the Lloyds ward, which then included much of the New Town centre, made the top 10 wards in England and Wales for "Scottish only identity" (4.0%) and "Scottish and British only identity" (1.2%) and was in the top 70 wards for residents employed in manufacturing (18.8%) and in the top 30 for residents employed in the wholesale and retail sector (24.9%).  Lloyds was a very working-class ward with 28.1% of working adults employed in routine occupations, placing it in the top 40 wards in England and Wales.  The actual steelworks site and Corby Village were in Corby Rural ward, which was dominated by villages around Corby town and thus had much more average demographics (although it still had a large Scottish identity).  In the 2021 North Northamptonshire elections, and in the Northamptonshire county elections before that, Lloyds voted strongly Labour and Corby Rural was safe Conservative (although UKIP came close to winning Corby Rural in a four-way split in 2013).
</p><p>
Corby has been the centre of its own parliamentary seat since 1983, and this has historically been an extremely polarised constituency combining strongly-Labour Corby with a large swathe of strongly Conservative-voting countryside in eastern Northamptonshire.  The result has been to create a bellwether marginal seat: although Labour won a by-election in November 2012, the Corby seat - renamed in 2024 as Corby and East Northamptonshire - has voted for the government at all eleven general elections since it was created.  The current MP is Labour's Lee Barron, who previously led the Labour group on the former Northampton council and was the Midlands regional secretary for the TUC.
</p><p>
The 2025 North Northamptonshire elections, by contrast, were won by Reform UK.  The Faragists have a majority on the council with 39 seats, against 13 Conservatives, 8 Greens (all of whom were elected from Kettering), 4 Labour, one Lib Dem and an independent.  Lloyds and Corby Village was one of two wards which Labour carried in the district, with a 44-36 lead over Reform UK, but much of the Labour score was a personal vote for their re-elected councillor Mark Pengelly and the ward ended up splitting its two seats between Labour's Pengelly and Reform UK's Robert Bloom.
</p><p>
Reform UK have attempted to ascribe Robert Bloom's resignation in August to personal reasons, but - and there's no nice way of saying this - he quit the council after being exposed as a racist by the <em>Northamptonshire Telegraph</em>, who published accusations of disgusting behaviour by him towards a West Indian family in his ward.  <a href="https://www.northantstelegraph.co.uk/news/people/corby-reform-councillor-resigns-over-serious-racism-allegations-5289085">Link here, if you really want to know the details</a>.
</p><p>
The defending Reform UK candidate in the resulting by-election is Lee Duffy, who was a close runner-up behind his running-mate Bloom in May and did get the consolation prize of being elected to Corby town council.  Duffy has also got himself into hot water during this campaign, with Northamptonshire police investigating allegations of treating - the electoral offence of providing free food and drink to voters - by the Reform UK campaign.  Labour have also selected their losing candidate from May: Geri Cullen is a retired accountant and is also a Corby town councillor.  Also standing are Paul Byrne for the Conservatives, Alex Lock for the Lib Dems and Lee Forster for the Green Party.

<h2>Bretforton and Offenham</h2>
</p><p>
<em>Wychavon council, Worcestershire; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Aaron Powell.</em>
</p><p>
Now for something completely different as we travel west to the Vale of Evesham.  The Bretforton and Offenham ward covers a pair of villages not far to the east of Evesham, in good farming country.  Despite the order of the names Offenham is the larger village with 1,262 electors in the roll; it is known for its large village maypole, which permanently stands 64 feet high.  Mind, it's not the tallest maypole in England: that honour belongs to the 84-foot pole in the Yorkshire village of Barwick-in-Elmet.
</p><p>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NKtyp6pqUQ
</p><p>
Which inspired a well-known piece of light music.  Arthur Wood's 1924 orchestral suite <em>My Native Heath</em> was intended to be evocative of Yorkshire, with its four movements bearing the titles "Knaresborough Status", "Ilkley Tarn", "Bolton Abbey" and "Barwick Green".  The first three movements are not often heard now (a vintage recording conducted by the composer is on YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqzX_xYQYFU">here</a>), but the maypole dance "Barwick Green" has become part of the national consciousness as the theme tune to <em>The Archers</em> - a contemporary drama in a rural setting which is generally understood to be inspired by the countryside of south-eastern Worcestershire.
</p><p>
The 2025 county council elections here have resulted in an ongoing drama which the writers of <em>The Archers</em> might have dismissed as far-fetched.  Bretforton and Offenham ward is part of the Littletons county division, which in May turned in the closest possible election result: a tie for first place, with Hannah Robson of the Green Party and Elizabeth Williams of Reform UK both finishing on 889 votes. The Conservatives, who had previously held the seat, finished in a close third place with 833 votes.  As the law requires, the returning officer drew lots to break the tie and the lot fell on the Greens' Hannah Robson who was declared elected with 890 votes: the original 889 from the electors, plus the returning officer's casting vote.
</p><p>
The defeated Reform UK candidate Elizabeth Williams has refused to accept this and she has taken the high-stakes move of launching legal action in the Election Court.  As I covered in the 24th July edition of this column (and at the time of writing nothing substantive has changed since then), Williams has made various allegations as to the conduct of the count and of the drawing of lots, and she seeks a declaration that the election is void on the grounds that Robson was elected by an equivalent of a "toss of a coin". Given that this is what the rules expect in the event of a tied election, that ground seems somewhat hopeless. Williams also makes allegations of undue influence and corrupt behaviour against the Green Party candidate and her campaign team, who are specifically accused of behaviour which sounds suspiciously like acting as tellers at polling stations.
</p><p>
I understand that the case of <em>Williams v Robson</em> is coming back to Court next week, but Williams has a hurdle to overcome in that hearing before she can put her case.  Specifically, electoral law specialist Timothy Straker KC, who is acting for the deputy returning officer Victor Allison of Wychavon council, has indicated that he will try to get the whole thing thrown out for being filed after the deadline.  Maybe we'll come back to this matter before too long in a future exciting edition of Election Court Watch.
</p><p>
Elections in this corner of Worcestershire aren't usually this interesting.  The Droitwich and Evesham parliamentary seat, which covers this ward, very easily re-elected its Conservative MP Nigel Huddleston last year when so many of his colleagues were falling like ninepins.  Huddleston is now in the shadow cabinet with the culture, media and sport portfolio.  The parliamentary seat has similar boundaries to Wychavon council, which has a Conservative majority that Bretforton and Offenham ward is part of.  Councillor Aaron Powell was first elected in 2019 unopposed, gaining his seat from the Lib Dems, and he was re-elected in 2023 with a 56-30 lead over Labour.  Powell has now left Wychavon council to take up a politically-restricted job with the West Midlands Combined Authority.
</p><p>
So the Conservatives have a by-election to defend here in what might turn out - depending on the outcome of the current Election Court case - to be a dry run for a forthcoming county council election.  Their defending candidate Mary Smith previously represented the neighbouring The Littletons ward on Wychavon council from 2003 to 2007, and she unsuccessfully tried to get that seat back in a January 2022 by-election.  Labour have selected Amanda Capewell, who works with young people who struggle to access mainstream education due to special needs or disabilities: in the 2025 county elections she stood in Evesham South.  Also on the ballot are Matt Jones of the Lib Dems, Marino Cretu for the Green Party, independent candidate Joe Davin who was an unsuccessful Reform UK candidate in the 2025 county elections, independent candidate Rob Robinson who runs a coffee house in Evesham and was last seen in this column at the Badsey and Aldington by-election last year, and Reform UK's Matthew Winfield who was an unsuccessful Conservative candidate in the 2023 Wychavon elections.

<em>Bath and North East Somerset council; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Deborah Collins.</em>

For today's city by-election we are in the fashionable city of Bath.  Immediately to the south-east of the city centre, on the south side of the River Avon, we find the suburb of Widcombe at the foot of Bath Locks, which mark the western end of the Kennet and Avon Canal.  A number of bridges span the Avon here, including the pedestrian Halfpenny Bridge next to Bath Spa railway station which takes its name from the former toll for crossing the river here.  The present bridge dates from 1877, after its predecessor had collapsed under the weight of traffic which had just alighted from an excursion train: ten people were killed in that disaster.
</p><p>
This area is close enough to Bath city centre that there was a lot of development here in the Georgian era, and many bulidings from that time survive.  For example, the 14 terraced houses of Widcombe Crescent, erected here in 1808, are listed at Grade I: one famous former resident here was Sir James Brooke, who lived at 1 Widcombe Crescent in the 1830s and went on to become the first White Rajah of Sarawak in what is now Malaysia.  Further up the hill, Lyncombe Vale was a beauty spot frequented by Georgian visitors to the city, and Jane Austen is known to have visited here.
</p><p>
Overlooking all of this is the Palladian stately home of Prior Park, which was built in the 1730s and 1740s for Ralph Allen.  Allen, who would go on to serve as the local mayor in 1742, had made a fortune as Bath's postmaster by taking on lucrative national contracts with the Post Office, delivering major reforms to the UK's postal service along the way.  He invested that money into the stone quarries at Combe Down to the south of the city and Bathampton Down to the east, from which the Bath stone that the city's Georgian buildings are made of was quarried.  Prior Park, built "to see all of Bath, and for all of Bath to see" was intended not just as a house for Allen but as an advertisement of just how useful and versatile Bath stone was.  The house is now home to an independent school called Prior Park College, while its gardens are in the hands of the National Trust.
</p><p>
The Widcombe and Lyncombe ward has a highly educated and highly middle-class demographic even by Bath standards.  In the 2021 census it ranked number 1 in south-west England for residents employed in professional, scientific and technical activities (15.5%).
</p><p>
Widcombe and Lyncombe were separate wards until 2019, and the list of former councillors for the predecessor wards includes a famous name.  David Bellotti was the first person to be elected as a Liberal Democrat MP, winning the Eastbourne by-election in 1990 after the seat's previous Conservative MP Ian Gow had been killed by an IRA car bomb.  Bellotti lost his seat to the Conservatives at the 1992 general election, and was then forced out of Sussex altogether amid controversy over the sale of Brighton and Hove Albion FC's Goldstone Ground: he was chief executive of the football club when the ground was controversially sold to developers in 1997, forcing the football team to groundshare with Gillingham for two seasons.  After that Bellotti moved to Bath to become the election agent for the city's then Lib Dem MP Don Foster, and he served as a councillor for Lyncombe ward from 2003 to 2015.
</p><p>
Bath has returned MPs to Parliament since the 14th century, and some other famous names appear on its list of former representatives.  Most prominently, from 1757 to 1763 Bath's two MPs were William Pitt the Elder, who was leading the UK through the Seven Years' War at the time, and his military commander Field Marshal John Ligonier.  Ligonier was in his late 70s at this point but he was still as physically and mentally sharp as ever, and not just with affairs of state: in the words of the historian Stephen Brumwell, despite being a confirmed bachelor Ligonier "continued to take pleasure in the company of young actresses and singers.  If gossip was to be credited, the venerable field-marshal simultaneously maintained four mistresses with a combined age of just fifty-eight."  <!--Paths of Glory, p.140-->  One wonders what the modern tabloid press would have made of that.
</p><p>
In those pre-Reform Act days Bath was the largest borough where only the members of the corporation had the right to vote.  The First Reform Act opened Bath's electorate to the people and expanded the constituency's boundaries to include Widcombe and Lyncombe.  The first election under these arrangements re-elected Whig MP Charles Palmer and also returned Radical candidate John Roebuck, with the Liberals' Henry Hobhouse losing out.
</p><p>
Henry Hobhouse was from a prominent Somerset family which has supplied a number of MPs over the years, including in the present House of Commons.  Wera Hobhouse, who has been the Lib Dem MP for Bath since 2017, was born in Germany and married into the family in 1989.  Before moving to Bath and being elected to Parliament Hobhouse had started her political career in Rochdale where she was a councillor from 2004 to 2014: she was initially elected for the Conservatives, but then quickly defected to the Lib Dems and served for some years on the council's cabinet.
</p><p>
After gaining her seat from the Conservatives in 2017 Hobhouse has made the Bath constituency safe for the Lib Dems, and Widcombe and Lyncombe ward - which was created in 2019 - shares that status.  In the 2023 local elections the Lib Dem slate enjoyed a 57-21 lead over the Conservatives here, placing Widcombe and Lyncombe within the Liberal Democrat majority on Bath and North East Somerset council.  The outgoing councillor Deborah Collins has stood down halfway through her first term of office on health grounds, after being diagnosed with cancer.
</p><p>
Defending this seat for the Liberal Democrats is Stuart Bridge, who is fighting his first election campaign.  The Conservatives have nominated Matt Corner, who is another rookie candidate.  Also standing are Neil Howard for the Green Party, Helen Torrance for Labour, independent candidate Madeline Blackburn who is hoping to join her husband Colin as an independent BANES councillor, independent candidate and community activist Casey Nolan whose given address is the old Halfpenny Bridge tollhouse, and Reform UK's Aaron Scott.

<h2>Kenn Valley</h2>
</p><p>
<em>Teignbridge council, Devon; caused by the disqualification of Conservative councillor Kevin Lake.</em>
</p><p>
We'll finish for the week in a ward which covers eight parishes immediately to the west and the south of Exeter.  All the major transport routes to and from the West Country pass through Kenn Valley ward: the Great Western main line runs along the west bank of the Exe estuary, while the M5 motorway terminates here at Pearce's Hill by splitting into three dual-carriageway roads: the A30 towards Cornwall, the A38 for Plymouth and the A380 for Torquay.  This is a hilly landscape, as can be seen by the fact that Exeter racecourse - most of which is in this ward - is the UK's highest racecourse at an altitude of 850 feet above sea level.  The racecourse buildings are in the parish of Kennford, where the A38 road crosses the River Kenn - just one of the watercourses which drain Kenn Valley ward.
</p><p>
The Kenn Valley does not include this ward's largest settlement.  The electoral register here is dominated by the village of Exminster, which overlooks the Exe estuary about four miles to the south of Exeter city centre.  This is a passing place not just for tourists but also for migratory birds: the Exminster and Powderham Marshes next to the estuary are run by the RSPB as a nature reserve.  Exminster has a human electorate of 3,934 and rising, with new housing currently under construction which will overspill the Exeter city boundary.  In the fourteenth century this village was the birthplace of William Courtenay, who became Archbishop of Canterbury in 1381 after his predecessor Simon of Sudbury had been killed in the Peasants' Revolt.  There was more violence in 1833 when Exeter racecourse was the setting for Devon's last duel, in which local doctor Peter Hennis was fatally wounded by Sir John Jeffcott.  Jeffcott might have won the duel, but it cost him his position as chief justice of Sierra Leone.
</p><p>
Modern arguments here are settled at the ballot box, and Exminster and the surrounding parishes featured in one of the closest results of the 2024 general election: the then work and pensions secretary Sir Mel Stride, who had served since 2010 as MP for Central Devon, held his seat by just 61 votes against a Labour challenge.  He is now the shadow chancellor of the exchequer.
</p><p>
Where the Labour challenge in this seat came from is not obvious from local elections, where the party is very weak.  The local authority here is Teignbridge council, which covers the countryside between Exeter and Torbay and is administered from Newton Abbot.  This was gained by the Lib Dems in 2019 and again in 2023, after defection losses had forced the council into No Overall Control in 2021: the 2023 election returned 26 Lib Dem councillors against 9 Conservatives, 9 members of the South Devon Alliance party (a nimbyist group based in the Newton Abbot area) and 3 independent councillors.  The South Devon Alliance has since disbanded and its councillors are now independents, while the most recent by-election here in Teignmouth West ward in May saw Reform UK gain a seat from the Lib Dems.
</p><p>
That was on the same day as the 2025 Devon county council elections, in which Kenn Valley ward is part of the Exminster and Haldon county division.  This is a safe Lib Dem unit and remained so in 2025, with Reform UK in a rather distant second place.
</p><p>
Despite this the Lib Dems had lost a seat here to the Conservatives in the 2023 Teignbridge council elections.  Topline voting figures were 39% for the Lib Dems, 29% for the Conservatives and 19% for the Greens, which was actually a slight swing towards the Lib Dem slate compared with 2019; but a lot of the Lib Dem score was a personal vote for outgoing councillor Charles Nuttall, while the Conservatives' Kevin Lake strongly outperformed his running-mates and ended up winning the ward's final seat by just seven votes.  Lake finished on 919 votes to 912 for the third Lib Dem candidate Donna Braund, returning to Teignbridge council after losing his seat in 2019.
</p><p>
Kevin Lake was disqualified from Teignbridge council in August for failing to attend any meetings of the council in six months.  He is now seeking re-election in the by-election caused by his own disqualification.  This isn't actually that uncommon, and candidates who attempt this have a fairly good track record of being re-elected: but this time Lake will have to get his seat back without the support of the local Conservatives, because he is standing as an independent candidate.  The official defending Conservative candidate is Lucille Baker, who lives in the parish of Whitestone at the northern end of the ward and is a regular Conservative election candidate and agent in Teignbridge and Exeter: Baker was on the Conservative slate for this ward in 2023 and finished a long way behind Kevin Lake, and in 2025 she contested the neighbouring Exeter county division of Alphington and Cowick.  She most recently appeared in this column in December 2017 as a by-election candidate for Newtown and St Leonard's ward in Exeter.  The Lib Dems will hope to gain with their candidate Kevin Smith, a retired IT worker and Exminster parish councillor who was chair of that parish council from 2021 to 2025.  A new electoral face is the Green Party candidate Scott Williams, who lives down the coast in Dawlish Warren and is a Dawlish parish councillor.  Also on the ballot are Niall Duffy for Labour, independent candidate Dudley Swain who is the chair of Dunchideock parish council in the west of the ward, and former Teignbridge Conservative councillor Terry Tume who is standing here for Reform UK.
