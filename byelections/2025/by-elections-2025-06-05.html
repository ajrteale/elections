</p><p>
Today's main course is north of the Border as we have an extended preview of a Scottish Parliament by-election.  These are fairly infrequent events.  This is the 12th Holyrood by-election since the Parliament was re-established in 1999, but the pace of polls has slowed down as time has gone on with just two such by-elections taking place in the last decade, and the last one (in Shetland) was nearly six years ago.  Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse is the first by-election of the current Holyrood term; and with the next Scottish Parliament general election due in May 2026, it may well end up being the only one.
</p><p>
In mediaeval times Hamilton was known as Cadzow, which is pronounced Cadyow: the z is descended from the yogh in the Middle Scots name Cadȝow.  In 1308 this was the location for the wedding of Mary Gordon of Huntly and Sir Wilter fitz Gilbert de Hameldone, who was originally on the English side during the first War of Scottish Independence and held Bothwell Castle for the English crown.  Walter gave refuge to a number of English nobles following the defeat at Bannockburn in 1314, but he then turned both Bothwell Castle and the refugees over to Robert the Bruce.  Robert rewarded Walter de Hameldone for this with the grant of lands which had previously belonged to the Comyns, including Cadzow Castle, and Gilbert became the first Laird of Cadzow.  His grandson David, the third Laird, was the first person known to use the spelling "Hamilton" for the family name.
</p><p>
The Hamilton family have been close allies of the Scottish and later British royal families ever since, and this resulted in the grant of a series of increasingly high-ranking peerages: Lord Hamilton in 1445, Earl of Arran in 1503, Marquess of Hamilton in 1599 and finally Duke of Hamilton in 1643, with a whole series of subsidiary titles underneath.  The second Earl of Arran ruled Scotland as regent between 1542 and 1554 until Mary, Queen of Scots came of age, and he was rewarded for arranging Mary's marriage to the dauphin of France with the French title of Duc de Châtellerault.  The 16th and present Duke, Alexander Douglas-Hamilton, is the premier peer of Scotland and holds the hereditary titles of Keeper of the Palace of Holyroodhouse and Bearer of the Crown of Scotland; his father Angus Douglas-Hamilton, the 15th Duke, fulfilled the latter role at the opening ceremony of the first Scottish Parliament in 1999.

</p><p>
With all this pageantry often comes great wealth, and the Dukes of Hamilton had one of the grandest country houses in Britain to flaunt all that wealth.  Hamilton Palace lay in the Clyde Valley at the northern end of a tree-lined avenue which was more than three miles long.  The original building here was a tower house from the fourteenth century, which was supplemented by Cadzow Castle on a dramatic site to the south overlooking the gorge of the Avon Water.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/cadzow-castle-view.webp" alt="Cadzow Castle" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Both buildings were damaged in the 1570s during the Marian civil war, and Cadzow Castle has been a ruin ever since then; but Hamilton Palace was rebuilt.  In its final form from 1832 it was one of the largest non-royal residences in the Western world, a massive neoclassical pile filled with all the fine art and decoration that the Dukes' money could buy.
</p><p>
The maintenance burden for the building was just as massive, and the 12th Duke - who disliked the Palace and rarely stayed there - had to sell off the library and much of the art in 1882 to pay his creditors and finance his lifestyle.  The auctions raised £786,847, equivalent to more than £100 million in today's values.  The financial crunch point might have come earlier had the 12th Duke's horse Cortolvin not won the 1867 Grand National at Aintree, with the prize money and the £16,000 paid out by the bookmakers saving the Hamiltons from financial ruin.
</p><p>
The Hamilton family also gave their name to the town previously known as Cadzow, which grew up just to the south-west of the Palace.  In the 19th century this was a coal-mining and textile town at the southern end of the Lanarkshire coalfield, and it was the mining that eventually spelt the end for Hamilton Palace.  There was a coal seam underneath the building, which by 1919 was being actively worked: and the threat of subsidence gave the 13th Duke and the trustees of the 12th Duke's estate the excuse they needed to dispose of a building which they could no longer afford to maintain.  Demolition work on Hamilton Palace began in 1921, and took more than a decade to complete.  Its site is now given over to sport and is occupied by bowling greens and a car park.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/chatelherault-lodge.webp" alt="Lodge, Chatelherault Country Park" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
The Duke of Hamilton's hunting lodge and the associated parkland, however, remains.  The lodge was built in 1734 by the architect William Adam as a folly designed to be seen from the Palace; it was given to the public in the 1970s in lieu of death duties following the death of the 14th Duke, and it is now run by South Lanarkshire council.  Available for weddings, etc.  The lodge and parkland, the ruins of Cadzow Castle nearby and the wooded Avon Water gorge to the south form Chatelherault Country Park, named after the Hamiltons' French title, which is well worth a visit.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/hamilton-old-church.webp" alt="Hamilton Old Church" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Back in the town centre we find the oldest structure in modern-day Hamilton.  The Netherton Cross, which dates back to the Kingdom of Strathclyde, now stands in front of Hamilton Old Parish Church which is another William Adam structure, completed in 1732.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/hamilton-townhouse.webp" alt="Hamilton Townhouse" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
The church lies on the eastern side of Cadzow Glen, a steep-sided valley just to the west of Hamilton town centre.  Overlooking the glen on the other side is the Hamilton Townhouse, which was completed in 1928 and was the seat of Hamilton burgh council.  It's now used as a library and civic centre, but it's no longer a seat of government.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/hamilton-council-hq.webp" alt="United Nations building" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Instead local government here is run from this striking building on nearby Almada Street.  This Architectural Heaven Circa 1960, clearly modelled on the United Nations building in New York, was officially opened in 1964 by Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother as the Lanark County Buildings, the headquarters of Lanarkshire county council; it was subsequently home to Strathclyde regional council from 1975 to 1996, and it now houses the offices and council chamber of South Lanarkshire council which is the local authority for Hamilton, Rutherglen, the New Town of East Kilbride and a large rural area to the south.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/hamilton-uws.jpg" alt="University of the West of Scotland, Hamilton campus" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
The presence of the Palace grounds and the low-lying Clyde valley floodplain to the east means that Hamilton's urban sprawl has developed to the north and west of the town centre.  Here we find the town's university campus, part of the University of the West of Scotland, located on high ground within the large business estate of Hamilton International Park.  It's here, in estates like Earnock, where most of this constituency's population live.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/larkhall-bunting.webp" alt="Union Street, Larkhall" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Hamilton Central and Hamilton West railway stations both lie on the Argyle Line, part of Glasgow's electric suburban railway network.  In 2005 this was extended to Larkhall, an industrial and strongly Protestant town south-east of Hamilton which lies on high ground between the Avon Water and the Clyde.  Larkhall is a strongly Protestant, Unionist and Rangers-supporting town, to the point that businesses here avoid having shopfronts in the green colours of Celtic.  (In 2007 South Lanarkshire council placed protective grilles over every green traffic light in the town, after spending £17,000 in the previous three years replacing green lenses which had been smashed by vandals.)  The town was once on the main road from Glasgow to London, but it was bypassed in the 1960s by the construction of the M74 motorway.  On my visit the bunting was out on Union Street, the old main road and the main shopping thoroughfare.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/stonehouse-elephants.webp" alt="Stonehouse Elephants" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
The third element of this constituency, Stonehouse, isn't much more than a large village full of 19th-century weaver's cottages.  It might have been much more.  In 1972 Stonehouse was designated as a New Town, with plans for 22,000 homes, factories, swimming pools, gyms, shopping centres, and a reopening for the railway line.  In 1976 the first phase of Stonehouse New Town was built, 96 houses on Murray Drive complete with a piece of public artwork: four concrete elephants, which have recently been painted with brightly-coloured designs to mark the 50th anniversary.  Shortly after the first residents moved into Murray Drive, the whole thing got cancelled leaving this housing estate and the Stonehouse Elephants as the only vestige of a New Town that never was.  (On my visit, I was chased all the way round this estate by a Labour Party loudspeaker car.)
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/stonehouse-bandstand.webp" alt="Bandstand, Alexander Hamilton Memorial Park" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
The cancellation of Stonehouse New Town means that the Alexander Hamilton Memorial Park, on the northern edge of Stonehouse sloping down to the Avon Water, still commands views like this.  The eponymous Alexander Hamilton was a native of Stonehouse who had made his fortune in the Kidderminster carpet industry, and he donated £5,000 towards the opening of the park in 1925.  The impressive bandstand was originally erected in Kelvingrove Park in Glasgow for the 1911 Scottish National Exhibition, before being bought in 1924 by the Fourth District Council and moved to Stonehouse to become part of the new park.

Hamilton has never been a big enough town to stand by itself as a Parliamentary burgh.  In Victorian Scotland there were quite a lot of towns like that, and the solution was to have a series of District of Burghs constituencies, which grouped together a number of disconnected towns to elect a single urban MP.  At the time of the 1885 redistribution Hamilton was part of the Falkirk Burghs constituency, which also included Lanark, Airdrie, Linlithgow and Falkirk itself.  Going into the 1885 general election the MP here was John Ramsay, who owned the Port Ellen distillery on Islay and was one of the first businessmen to export Scotch whisky in bulk to the USA, setting up a trade which remains very valuable to the UK's balance of payments (tariffs permitting).
</p><p>
Ramsay had first entered Parliament at an April 1868 by-election in the Stirling District of Burghs, after the previous Liberal MP Laurence Oliphant had left Parliament under the influence of a spiritualist prophet.  (Yes, really.)  In that poll Ramsay defeated the future Prime Minister Henry Campbell-Bannerman by 71 votes in an all-Liberal contest, but Campbell-Bannerman won the rematch at the general election later that year.  In the 1874 general election Ramsay was adopted as the Liberal candidate for the Falkirk Burghs and he comfortably defeated the Conservative candidate Alexander Baird by 2,583 votes to 1,958.  However, after the election Ramsay found that he was disqualified from being an MP for holding a Government contract and his election had therefore been void.  He extricated himself from the contract, stood for re-election in the resulting Falkirk Burghs by-election of 26th March 1874, and was re-elected unopposed.
</p><p>
John Ramsay's accident-prone Parliamentary career came to a head in the 1885 general election, when the Falkirk Burghs had not one, not two, but <em>three</em> separate Liberal candidates, with James Weir standing as an Independent Liberal and John Roskill being nominated by the Liberal party's Hamilton branch which had fallen out with Ramsay.  Roskill and Ramsay quickly patched up their differences and Roskill withdrew from the campaign (although he was credited with 14 votes at the declaration), while Weir's intervention did not prevent Ramsay from defeating the Conservative candidate by 900 votes.  This proved to be John Ramsay's final term of office, as he retired the following year.
</p><p>
In 1886 the Falkirk Burghs turned in a very close result between the defending Liberal candidate Harry Smith and the Liberal Unionists' William Sinclair, with Sinclair eventually winning by 2,712 votes to 2,693, a majority of 19.  Sinclair was a Belfast Presbyterian who had gone into business in Liverpool, and he had briefly served as a Liberal MP for County Antrim in 1885 before joining the breakaway Liberal Unionists over the issue of Irish Home Rule.  He served one term before losing the rematch to Harry Smith in 1892.  Smith likewise had only one term in Parliament, losing his seat by 253 votes in 1895 to Liberal Unionist John Wilson, who was chairman of the Wilson and Clyde coal company.
</p><p>
Wilson stood down at the Liberal landslide of 1906, at which the Falkirk Burghs was one of the many Liberal gains.  Despite an intervention from Hamilton trade unionist David Gilmour as a Scottish Workers candidate, the Liberals' John Macdonald won the seat comfortably and was re-elected in both 1910 elections.  Macdonald had served in Parliament before, as MP for the London constituency of Bow and Bromley from 1892 to 1895, and by 1910 he was described by the <em>Times</em> Guide to the House of Commons as secretary of the Cobden Club and "a prominent member of what is generally spoken of as the 'Little Navy' group in the House".  (Answers on a postcard to the usual address.)  He leaves our story in 1918, when Hamilton was removed from the Falkirk Burghs to become the centre of a county constituency of its own.

During this period Larkhall and the outlying parts of what is now Hamilton's urban sprawl were part of the Mid Lanarkshire parliamentary seat, which also took in Wishaw and Newmains to the east and the open space to the west which would become Cambuslang and Castlemilk.  This seat was dominated by the coalmining industry, but in 1885 the Labour party lay in the future and many working men did not yet have the vote.  As a result of this, Mid Lanarkshire was a Liberal seat throughout the period 1885-1918.  Its first MP was Stephen Mason, a former Glasgow merchant and JP, who managed to increase his majority against the national trend in 1886 by emphasising his support for Irish home rule.
</p><p>
Mason resigned from the Commons in 1888, and the resulting Mid Lanarkshire by-election of 27th April 1888 was a harbinger of things to come.  This the first parliamentary contest for a young socialist called Keir Hardie, who was a Lanarkshire man and had previously worked and organised strikes in the constituency's collieries.  He would also later campaign for the rights of workers at the J and J White chemicals factory in Rutherglen, exposing their poor working conditions.  Hardie, standing as an Independent Labour candidate, finished last with just 8% of the vote; he saw that as a promising start, and as we shall see the Labour Party which he went on to become the first leader of has had rather more success in the area since.  However, in this by-election Keir Hardie got nowhere near the winning Liberal candidate John Philipps.
</p><p>
Philipps was one of three brothers who all served as MPs, the other two being Indian army officer Ivor Philipps and the fraudster Owen Philipps, Lord Kylsant, who has appeared in this column before.  John Philipps resigned as MP for Mid Lanarkshire in 1894, but later returned to the Commons as MP for Pembrokeshire and ended up in the Lords as Viscount St Davids.
</p><p>
The second Mid Lanarkshire by-election, to replace John Philipps, took place on 5th April 1894 and turned into a close contest.  Robert Harington-Stuart, a Crimean War veteran standing for the Liberal Unionists, lost by 330 votes to the new Liberal candidate James Caldwell.  Caldwell was a Glasgow businessman who had previously been in the Liberal Unionists himself: he had been elected on their ticket as MP for Glasgow St Rollox in 1886, but subsequently crossed the floor to the Liberals.  He was re-elected in 1895, holding his seat by just 71 votes against the Conservative landslide of that year.  For his final term in office Caldwell's party affiliation was less important, as he served as a Deputy Speaker during the 1906-10 parliament.
</p><p>
The two 1910 elections in Mid Lanarkshire both returned John Howard Whitehouse, whose career up to that point had included a number of university posts in Birmingham and Manchester, social work for the Cadbury family in Birmingham and a devotion to the life and works of John Ruskin.  The January 1910 <em>Times Guide to the House of Commons</em> also recounts that Whitehouse was "well known for his interest in boys", a phrase which has rather different and unfortunate connotations a century on; what the <em>Times</em> meant was that he specialised in the topics of education and child labour.  Whitehouse would go on to found Bembridge School, a now-closed public school on the Isle of Wight.

</p><p>
During this period Stonehouse was covered by the South Lanarkshire constituency, which took in a large rural area in the south and west of the county spanning from Biggar to pre-New Town East Kilbride.  This had been represented since 1880 by the Liberals' John Hamilton, a former soldier in the Life Guards who came from a minor aristocratic family.  Hamilton lost his seat by 18 votes in 1886 to the Conservatives' James Hozier, a former diplomat.  Hozier retired in 1906 and his former seat fell in the Liberal landslide to Sir Walter Menzies, who came from an industrial family: his father James Menzies had founded the Phoenix Tube Works at Rutherglen, making iron boiler tubes.  Sir Walter died in 1913 after a long illness, and the resulting South Lanarkshire by-election of 12th December 1913 saw an intervention from Labour, whose candidate Thomas Gibb was backed by the Scottish Miners' Federation: this split the left-wing vote, and the Liberals lost the seat to William Watson, an advocate who would later serve as Solicitor-General for Scotland, as Lord Advocate, and finally as a Law Lord.

</p><p>
The redistribution of 1918 dissolved the Falkirk District of Burghs and created a Hamilton parliamentary seat, which at this point had very similar boundaries to the modern Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse Holyrood seat.  Inflation is a problem in constituency names these days as well as in everything else.
</p><p>
This was the point at which Labour took over the Hamilton constituency, aided by the 1918 Representation of the People Act granting the vote to all men aged 21 or over and most women aged 30 or over.  Previously the right to vote had been subject to a property qualification, excluding many working-class men and all women from the electorate.  The 1918 result in Hamilton was an emphatic rejection of the outgoing Mid Lanarkshire Liberal MP John Howard Whitehouse, who sought re-election here but finished in last place with a deposit-losing score of 3%.  In third place with 26% of the vote was David Gilmour, secretary of the Lanarkshire Miners' County Union, standing for the short-lived National Democratic and Labour Party; the Unionist candidate Henry Keith, who had the government's coupon, was second on 29%; and the winner was Duncan Graham, another coalminer and political organiser of the Scottish Miners' Federation, who polled 42%.  Henry Keith had another go in 1922, losing to Graham by 58-42 in a straight fight; he eventually made it to Parliament many years later via the unusual route of becoming a Law Lord, with the title Lord Keith of Kinkel.
</p><p>
In an unusual display of political stability Duncan Graham went on to serve as MP for Hamilton throughout the turbulent years between the two World Wars, winning seven terms of office as Hamilton became one of the few seats to stay with Labour all the way through that period.  Candidates who took him on and failed included the suffragist Helen Fraser, who stood in 1923 for the Liberals, and the future SNP leader Andrew Dewar Gibb, who stood here in 1924 as - ironically - a Unionist candidate.  Graham's closest call came in the Labour disaster year of 1931, when his majority fell to 2,053 votes.
</p><p>
Duncan Graham died in October 1942 at the age of 75.  The resulting first Hamilton by-election of 29th January 1943 saw another coalminer and trade unionist, Tom Fraser, defeat an independent candidate very easily.  The wartime political truce meant that Fraser did not face Unionist opposition in that by-election.
</p><p>
Again, this was the start of a long Parliamentary career.  Tom Fraser went on to win ten terms of office in a very safe Labour seat, and only in 1959 did his vote share fall under two-thirds - and then only marginally.  Fraser served in the Attlee government as a junior minister in the Scotland Office, and was appointed by Harold Wilson as his first Minister of Transport; in that role Fraser oversaw many of the Beeching rail closures, and he imposed a speed limit of 70 miles per hour on British motorways.  His seat was expanded by boundary changes in 1950, to take in Blantyre to the north.
</p><p>
In 1967 Tom Fraser resigned from the Commons to become chairman of the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board.  The resulting second Hamilton by-election of 2nd November 1967 broke the mould of Scottish politics.  Labour selected Alexander Wilson, a coalminer who was a local councillor in the Third District Council of Lanarkshire.  In those days Scotland outside the burghs was divided for local government purposes into Landward Districts, the equivalent of Rural Districts in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.  Most Scottish Landward Districts had names, but the eight districts in Lanarkshire were numbered from First to Fourth and Sixth to Ninth; there had originally been a Fifth district as well, but this had disappeared when East Kilbride became a burgh in 1963.  Larkhall, Stonehouse and the area around Hamilton burgh were all covered by the Fourth District, while the Third District of Lanarkshire where Wilson was a councillor was based on Carluke and villages to the north and east of Lanark.  (It has nothing to do with the former Scottish football team Third Lanark, who took their name from the military unit they were originally part of: the 3rd Battalion of the Lanarkshire Rifle Volunteers.)
</p><p>
Wilson's main challenge ended up coming from the unexpected direction of Winnie Ewing, a solicitor and secretary of the Scottish Bar Association who was standing for a fringe political movement called the Scottish National Party.  The SNP had contested Hamilton only once before, polling 6% and losing their deposit in 1959; and right up until polling day Labour's Wilson was a strong favourite with the bookmakers.
</p><p>
In a huge upset, Ewing defeated Wilson in the 1967 Hamilton by-election by 18,397 votes to 16,598, a majority of 1,799, to become only the second ever Scottish National Party MP.  She lost the rematch to Wilson in 1970 by 8,572 votes, but later served as MP for Moray and Nairn before representing the Highlands and Islands in both the European and Scottish Parliaments.  The SNP have been ever-present in the House of Commons since Winnie Ewing's first election.
</p><p>
The two 1974 elections saw the Hamilton seat reduced in size, with Blantyre transferred to the East Kilbride constituency and Stonehouse moving into the Lanark seat.  Both of those polls pitted Labour MP Alexander Wilson against the SNP's Ian Macdonald, who had been the party's national organiser in the 1960s and was by now running a dry-cleaning business.  The Conservative candidate here in February 1974 was also a famous name: Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, a younger son of the 14th Duke, who at this point was an advocate and an Edinburgh councillor: he would go on to be elected as MP for Edinburgh West in the October general election.  Wilson won both polls, but his majority over the SNP fell to 3,332 votes in October.
</p><p>
This small lead posed a problem for Labour when Alexander Wilson died in office in 1978.  The resulting third Hamilton by-election on 31st May 1978 saw three candidates save their deposits.  In third place was the Conservative candidate Alexander Scrymgeour, then known as Lord Scrymgeour, who has sat in the House of Lords since 1983 when he succeeded to the title of Earl of Dundee; with this hereditary title came the hereditary role of Royal Standard Bearer of Scotland, and Dundee fulfilled that role in 2022 at the coronation of Charles III.  In second place was Margo MacDonald, the winner of the 1973 Glasgow Govan by-election and Depute Leader of the SNP.  But this time Labour made no mistake: George Robertson held the 1978 Hamilton by-election with 51% of the vote and a majority of 6,492 over MacDonald.  He was easily re-elected for a full term in 1979.
</p><p>
There were major changes to constituency boundaries in 1983.  Blantyre was moved back into the Hamilton constituency along with Bothwell and Uddingston to the north; while Larkhall was moved into the Lanark seat which was renamed as Clydesdale.  George Robertson stayed with the redrawn Hamilton constituency and he was not seriously challenged at any of the general elections on these boundaries.   In 1993 he joined the Shadow Cabinet as shadow Scottish secretary.

</p><p>
The boundary changes also improved the Labour position in the Clydesdale seat, which covered huge areas of moorland but also contained a number of industrial towns like Lanark and Carluke.  The predecessor Lanark seat had consistently been marginal up until 1979, and the outgoing Lanark Labour MP Dame Judith Hart - who had gained her seat in 1959 against the national trend - had had to work hard to keep her seat.  Hart had also combined this with a ministerial career, which peaked in 1968-69 when she served in Wilson's second Cabinet as the first female Paymaster General; she also had three separate spells as minister for overseas development under Wilson and Callaghan.  The boundary changes gave her a safe seat.
</p><p>
Hart retired in 1987 (joining the Lords the following year) and passed her seat on to Jimmy Hood, the last of the coalmining MPs in this corner of Lanarkshire.  Hood was from Lesmahagow and had worked as a mining engineer since 1964, moving to Nottinghamshire when the Lanarkshire coalfield closed in 1968.  He had become an NUM official in 1973, serving in that role during the miners' strike, and in 1979 he had been elected to Newark and Sherwood council.  In 1987 he defeated candidates including future Conservative MP Raymond Robertson and future SNP MSP Michael Russell.  Jimmy Hood had a long Westminster career, serving on the Labour backbenches continuously until 2015.
</p><p>
In 1997 Hamilton town was divided between two constituencies.  The north part of the town together with Bothwell and Uddingston was transferred into a redrawn Motherwell North, which was renamed as "Hamilton North and Bellshill"; in consequence the rump Hamilton seat became "Hamilton South".  George Robertson was elected as Hamilton South's new MP with a massive majority, and he immediately joined the first Blair Cabinet as defence secretary.
</p><p>
In August 1999 Robertson hit the world stage by being appointed as Secretary General of NATO, succeeding Javier Solana.  This meant he would have to leave the Commons.  If he had resigned in the usual way, then the by-election could not have been called until the summer recess was over.  So Labour, who wanted a quick campaign, got around this problem by elevating Robertson to the peerage as Lord Robertson of Port Ellen, allowing the Speaker to issue a writ under the Recess Elections Act straight away.
</p><p>
The resulting Hamilton South by-election on 23rd September 1999 did indeed prove to be a close call.  The Scottish National Party tried to emulate Winnie Ewing's win in the 1967 by-election by selecting her daughter, Annabelle Ewing; the Labour candidate was Bill Tynan, a toolmaker and trade union official who eventually won by just 556 votes.  There were twelve candidates altogether, a record for a Scottish by-election at the time; five of them saved their deposits, including the Scottish Socialist Party (who finished third) and an independent candidate campaigning for change at the top of the local football club Hamilton Academical, who were homeless and going through major financial turmoil at the time.  Annabelle Ewing later served as SNP MP for Perth in 2001-05, and she is now the MSP for Cowdenbeath.  Bill Tynan made Hamilton South safe again in the 2001 general election, when the SNP candidate was future MSP John Wilson.
</p><p>
By this point the Scottish Parliament had been re-established, and Hamilton South and Clydesdale both had Labour MPs and Labour MSPs.  At the first Holyrood election in 1999 the very first seat to declare its result was Hamilton South, giving Tom McCabe the distinction of being the first modern Member of the Scottish Parliament to be elected.  McCabe had worked his way up from the Hoover factory in Cambuslang to become leader of Hamilton district council and then the first leader of the modern South Lanarkshire council.  He immediately joined the Scottish government, serving as the first Minister for Parliament until 2001 and then holding the finance portfolio from 2004 to 2007.  The Clydesdale seat was initially represented by Labour MSP Karen Gillon, who enjoyed rather smaller majorities than McCabe although still being elected comfortably enough.

The present Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse constituency was introduced for the 2011 Scottish Parliament election.  It has been won at all three elections to date by the Scottish National Party's Christina McKelvie.  McKelvie was a Glaswegian who had worked in Glasgow city council's social work services department before entering politics.  She was first elected to Holyrood in 2007, taking the fifth of the seven regional seats for Central Scotland after being defeated by McCabe in Hamilton South; a rematch in 2011 saw McKelvie take McCabe's constituency seat.  In 2021 Christina McKelvie was re-elected for her fourth term of office, polling 46% in Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse against 34% for Labour's Monica Lennon and 17% for the Conservatives' Meghan Gallacher, with the Lib Dems (who lost their deposit) being the only other party to stand.  Both Lennon and Gallacher secured election to Holyrood as regional MSPs for Central Scotland; in the Central Scotland regional vote, which was also contested by the Greens and some minor parties, this constituency gave 41% to the SNP, 25% to Labour and 22% to the Conservatives.
</p><p>
In 2016 McKelvie had become convenor of Holyrood's equalities and human rights committee, and she served in that role until being appointed as a junior Scottish minister in 2018 with responsibility for equalities and older people.  In February 2024 she was reshuffled to become minister for drugs and alcohol policy, but in August 2024 McKelvie went on sick leave after being diagnosed with breast cancer.  She died in March 2025 from that illness, aged just 57 years old.
</p><p>
During McKelvie's tenure as an MSP, the Westminster seats in this area have swung in line with the general Scottish pattern.  The main Westminster equivalent to this seat was called Lanark and Hamilton East from 2005 to 2024 and then Hamilton and Clyde Valley since 2024.  Lanark and Hamilton East was represented by the previous Clydesdale MP Jimmy Hood until he went down to defeat in the SNP landslide of 2015.  The SNP's Angela Crawley was re-elected in 2017 at the top of an extraordinary result in which the top three candidates were separated by just 0.7 percentage points: Crawley polled 16,444 votes against 16,178 for the Conservatives and 16,084 for Labour.  She stood down at the 2024 general election, when Hamilton and Clyde Valley swung back to Labour and elected Imogen Walker: Walker is a former Lambeth councillor and the wife of Sir Keir Starmer's chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney.
</p><p>
From 2005 to 2024 the western part of Hamilton town was covered by the Rutherglen and Hamilton West constituency, which had a huge turnover of MPs during this period.  It was won at its first contest by Labour whip Tommy McAvoy who had represented the predecessor seat of Glasgow Rutherglen.  McAvoy retired to the Lords in 2010 and handed his seat over to Tom Greatrex, who was swept away in the 2015 SNP landslide by Margaret Ferrier.  Ferrier lost her seat in 2017 to Labour's Ged Killen by 265 votes, but she won the rematch in 2019.
</p><p>
In October 2020 Margaret Ferrier lost the SNP whip for breaching COVID lockdown rules, for which she was subsequently prosecuted for "culpable and reckless conduct" in 2022.  The Commons standards committee then investigated the matter and recommended that Ferrier be suspended for 30 days, which led to her being ejected from the House in August 2023 by a recall petition.  The resulting Westminster by-election in October 2023 was gained by Labour candidate Michael Shanks, who was re-elected in 2024 for a redrawn Rutherglen seat that contains no part of this Holyrood constituency.
</p><p>
Stonehouse, meanwhile, has been within the Westminster constituency based on East Kilbride since 2005.  This was represented from that year (under the name of East Kilbride, Strathaven and Lesmahagow) by Labour MP Adam Ingram until 2010, then by Labour's Michael McCann.  In 2015 McCann was defeated by the SNP's Lisa Cameron, who progressively fell out with her party and defected to the Conservatives in 2023.  She didn't seek re-election in 2024, and the redrawn East Kilbride and Strathaven seat was won by Labour candidate and former Lewisham councillor Joani Read.
</p><p>
If we take as a best fit for the constituency the three wards covering Hamilton plus Larkhall ward, then the 2022 South Lanarkshire council elections gave 38% of the first preferences to the SNP, 36% to Labour and 17% to the Conservatives; the council seats split 6 each to the SNP and Labour, 2 to the Conservatives, and one to the Lib Dems who picked up Labour transfers in Hamilton West and Earnock ward.  Labour carried Hamilton South ward and Larkhall ward, with the SNP topping the poll in the other two Hamilton wards.  Adding Stonehouse (which is part of Avondale and Stonehouse ward) into the mix would slightly increase the SNP lead.
</p><p>
Last month Boundaries Scotland completed its second review of Scottish Parliament constituencies, which will be implemented at the 2026 Holyrood election subject to approval from the Parliament.  No changes are recommended to the Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse constituency going forward, but the seat is due to be transferred from the Central Scotland region to the South Scotland region.

The voters of western Hamilton are taking part in their second by-election in three years, following the Westminster poll in Rutherglen and Hamilton West in 2023.  As on that occasion the defending Scottish National Party candidate is Katy Loudon, who lost the 2023 by-election and went on to lose the rematch as the SNP's 2024 Westminster candidate in Rutherglen.  She is a South Lanarkshire councillor representing Cambuslang West ward, which is not part of this constituency.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/hamilton-lab.webp" alt="Lab office" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
The Labour candidate is Davy Russell, who was appointed in 2018 as a Deputy Lieutenant of Lanarkshire: this is a civic role supporting the Lord Lieutenant, who is the King's representative in the county.  At that time Russell was head of operational services for Glasgow City Council having spent his career working for local government; more recently he has been helping to run a local hospice and supporting people with disabilities.
</p><p>
The Conservatives have selected Richard Nelson, who is a South Lanarkshire councillor for Larkhall ward and works locally for the NHS.  Last year he was the Conservative candidate for Hamilton and Clyde Valley in the Westminster election.

</p><p>
We have a ballot paper of ten candidates altogether.  Standing for the Liberal Democrats is Aisha Mir, a businesswoman with a number of previous parliamentary candidacies to her name, most recently in East Kilbride and Strathaven at the 2024 Westminster election.  Also on that ballot was the Scottish Green Party candidate Ann McGuinness, who is a director of the Scottish Rural Action charity.  The socially-conservative Scottish Family Party have selected Andy Brady, who describes himself as a "happily married dad of four".  Reform UK polled only 58 votes in the Central Scotland regional ballot here in 2021 but should do much better than that this time: their candidate Ross Lambie is a South Lanarkshire councillor for Clydesdale South ward, who was elected in 2022 for the Conservatives and stood on their ticket in East Kilbride and Strathaven (a seat the Tories were defending thanks to defection) in the 2024 Westminster election.  The UK Independence Party's Janice Mackay was an unsuccessful candidate in Clydesdale South three years ago and she is a regular parliamentary candidate: Mackay actually had UKIP's best result in the 2024 general election when she polled 6.2% in Stone, Great Wyrley and Penkridge (largely thanks to there being no Reform UK candidate there).  Trade unionist Collette Bradley is top of the alphabetical ballot paper for the Scottish Socialist Party, while at the other end is independent candidate Marc Wilkinson who runs a pizza shop in Edinburgh and has turned up in a number of recent Edinburgh council by-elections; we will meet him again in that context later this month.  The BBC have profiles of all the candidates <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c3rpjw32rrwo">here (link)</a>.

We have seen in this piece that Hamilton has had a few famous by-elections over the last century, not least the one where Winnie Ewing broke through for the SNP in 1967.  Will this Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse by-election break the mould like that - or will it be a routine hold like the ones in 1978 or 1999?  We'll find for sure once the votes tumble out of the ballot boxes onto the counting tables.  In the meantime, don't forget that today control lies with you, the voter.  To quote a blackboard which I saw outside a café opposite the Lanark County Buildings:

<h2>Somercotes</h2>
</p><p>
<em>Amber Valley council, Derbyshire; caused by the death of Labour councillor John McCabe.</em>
</p><p>
As well as the main event in Scotland, we have eight local by-elections to bring you today from England.  However, six of these wards will not count until Friday; and in the case of our first poll the count won't even start until 2 o'clock on Friday afternoon.
</p><p>
So we have a while to wait for the result in the first-ever by-election in a county where Reform UK have taken over local government following the May 2025 local elections.  Following those elections last month RUK now have overall control of ten councils, minority control of three others, and hold two elected mayoralties.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/amber-valley-somercotes-2025.webp" alt="Amber Valley, Somercotes" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
One of those RUK-controlled counties is Derbyshire, where the previous Conservative administration was defeated last month.  Reform UK now have 42 Derbyshire county councillors against just 12 Conservatives, 3 Labour, 3 Lib Dems, 2 Greens and 2 independents.  They performed particularly well in the former coalfield districts in eastern Derbyshire, including winning seven out of ten seats in Amber Valley - a district where the Conservatives had swept the board in the 2021 county elections.  This is where we find Somercotes, a pit village to the south of Alfreton which is now surrounded by large industrial estates: Somercotes makes the top 100 wards in England and Wales for people employed in routine occupations (25.8%) and in manufacturing (18.7%).
</p><p>
Recent elections in Amber Valley illustrate of just how badly-behaved England's first-past-the-post system can be sometimes.  In the 2023 local elections this was one of the few districts where Reform UK actually put a serious campaign together, after a number of Conservative activists including then-county councillors Philip Rose and Alex Stevenson defected to the party shortly before the election.  What this actually achieved in Amber Valley was to split the right-wing vote: vote shares across the district in May 2023 were just 32% for Labour, 30% for the Conservatives, 19% for the Green Party and 10% for Reform UK, but the seats split 26 and an overall majority to Labour, 7 to the Conservatives, 6 to the Greens, 2 to the Belper Independents and one to the Lib Dems with Reform UK getting nothing.  </p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2023/amber-valley23s.svgz" alt="Amber Valley, 2023" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Something similar happened in the Amber Valley parliamentary seat in 2024, with Labour's Linsey Farnsworth gaining the seat on 37% against 29% for Reform UK's Alex Stevenson and 25% for the outgoing Conservative MP Nigel Mills.  These numbers aren't comparable with the district figures from 2023 due to different boundaries, but the inference remains obvious.  Somercotes would have been in the Labour column on both occasions: unusually for Amber Valley it voted Labour at every election from 2002 to 2022, and Labour enjoyed a big lead of 61-19 over the Conservatives here in 2023.
</p><p>
However, Somercotes ward would not have been in the Labour column in May 2025.  It's mostly in the Alfreton and Somercotes county division with a small corner in the Swanwick and Riddings division, and those areas respectively voted 50% and 43% for Reform UK.  Vote shares across the district were 38% for Reform UK, 19% for the Conservatives, 18% for the Greens and 17% for Labour, with the ten seats splitting 7 to Reform UK, 2 to the Greens, 1 to Labour and nothing to the Conservatives.
</p><p>
Interestingly, by this point Philip Rose and Alex Stevenson had fallen out with Reform UK, taking a large number of activists out of the party with them, and they fielded an "Amber Valley Independents" slate in the elections (as independent candidates, because the Amber Valley Independents are not currently registered as a political party with the Electoral Commission).  This slate mostly failed to trouble the scorers, but Stevenson himself came second seeking re-election in Heanor where the town council is now controlled by Stevensonite councillors.  There were two Amber Valley council by-elections held alongside May's county elections; Reform UK didn't stand in those by-elections, and Rose won one of them as an independent candidate in Ironville and Riddings ward.
</p><p>
This by-election is to replace the longest-serving member of Amber Valley council.  John McCabe died in late March after nearly forty years of service as a councillor for Somercotes, having been first elected in 1986.  He had held a number of key council roles over the years, most recently serving as cabinet member for "communities and street pride".
</p><p>
Defending this seat for Labour is Sian Harper, who is John McCabe's daughter.  The Conservatives have selected Jake Gilbert, a former Heanor town councillor who got a rather negative writeup from <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10081417/Tory-councillor-MP-staffer-20-apologises-posting-tweets-criticising-NHS-nurses.html">Mail Online in 2021 (link)</a> over his social media; Gilbert was 20 then, hopefully he's grown up a bit since.  Also standing are Reform UK's James Kerry (who has previously served as a Conservative member of Belper town council), the Lib Dems' Paul Slater, the Greens' Russ Hubber and the aforementioned Alex Stevenson as an independent candidate.

<h2>Fairstead; and<br>
North Lynn</h2>
</p><p>
<em>King's Lynn and West Norfolk council; caused respectively by the resignations of Labour councillors Margaret Wilkinson and Micaela Bartrum.</em>
</p><p>
There are two English towns today which have two local by-elections taking place.  One of these is King's Lynn, which was once one of the most important towns in England as a Hanseatic port on the River Great Ouse.  Then the Middle Ages happened, and King's Lynn has fallen somewhat into obscurity since then.  However, the Port of King's Lynn is still very much in operation today and it handles 400,000 tonnes of cargo each year, mostly from forestry and agriculture.  It takes up much of the acreage of North Lynn ward, which is otherwise a residential area to the north of King's Lynn town centre.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/klwn-n-lynn-2025.webp" alt="KLWN, N Lynn" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
North Lynn ward is a seriously deprived area with a very working-class population.  In the 2021 census it made the top 40 wards in England and Wales for adults working in routine occupations (28.7%) or in manufacturing (20.3%).  It ranked number 3 in England and Wales for adults with Level 1 qualifications (1-4 GCSE passes or equivalent) at 16.6%, the highest figure for any ward in East Anglia.  North Lynn also ranked 13th for residents born in the 2004 EU eastern expansion countries (18.0%).
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/klwn-fairstead-2025.webp" alt="KLWN, Fairstead" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Slightly further up the social scale is Fairstead ward, which is a former London overspill council estate on the eastern edge of King's Lynn with a bad reputation for crime.  Fairstead ward also has a high eastern European population, and it ranked 8th in the 2021 census for residents employed in the health and social work sector (29.2%).  The Queen Elizabeth Hospital, just outside the ward boundary to the north and named after Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, is clearly a major employer here.
</p><p>
The local authority here is King's Lynn and West Norfolk council, where the Conservatives are the largest party; however, they are short of a majority and a coalition of independent, Liberal Democrat and Green councillors is in control.  Fairstead and North Lynn wards are not part of the council majority because they have a full slate of Labour councillors.  In 2023 Fairstead ward voted 46% for Labour, 33% for the Conservatives and 22% for the Greens; while in North Lynn the two-person Labour slate was opposed only by a single Conservative candidate who lost 70-30.  North Lynn's turnout on that occasion was just 12.4%, which is one of the most pathetic scores this column has ever seen in an ordinary local election.
</p><p>
At county level North Lynn ward is part of the King's Lynn North and Central division which the Conservatives gained from Labour at the 2021 Norfolk county elections; they still hold that seat, because the 2025 Norfolk county elections were cancelled.  Fairstead ward is part of the Gaywood South division which had swung back and forth between the Conservatives and Labour in this century.  In May 2021 Conservative county councillor Thomas Smith was re-elected for a second term and then immediately resigned to take up a new job in London, and the resulting by-election in July 2021 was won by ... the Liberal Democrats, who came out of nowhere.  King's Lynn is part of the North West Norfolk parliamentary seat, which - like Castle Point last week - voted Labour in 1997 but Conservative in 2024.
</p><p>
The losing Labour candidate for Gaywood South in both 2021 elections was Micaela Bartrum, who was subsequently elected in 2023 as a borough councillor for North Lynn ward.  She has now resigned for reasons which were not reported.  Thomas Smith had gained his county council seat in 2017 from Labour's Margaret Wilkinson who is a very long-serving politician: she has now stood down from King's Lynn and West Norfolk council on health grounds after 42 years in office, having been first elected in 1983.
</p><p>
The candidate lists for these by-elections both have an unusual feature: there is no Conservative candidate.  The North West Norfolk Conservative branch blamed this on not being able to find anyone willing and suitable, and it appears that the Tories have been struggling with this issue in King's Lynn for some time now: both Fairstead and North Lynn wards had only one Conservative candidate for two seats in 2023, and the Tories failed to contest the last King's Lynn and West Norfolk council by-election in Gaywood Clock ward in December 2022 which resulted in Labour winning the seat unopposed.  Nonetheless, this is still out of the ordinary for a party which very rarely misses a local by-election.
</p><p>
Despite this lack of Conservatives, both wards up for election today still have more candidates standing than last time.  Defending Fairstead for Labour is Michelle Carter, an artist who contested the rural Heacham ward in 2023.  The Green Party have selected Ian Milburn, who is studying for a master's degree in data analytics at York.  The Lib Dems' Crystal Colwell, Reform UK's Jacqueline Fry and independent candidate Benjamin Lemmon also stand.
</p><p>
In North Lynn ward the Labour defence is led by Wilfred Lambert, who narrowly lost the 2021 county election in King's Lynn North and Central: he was last seen on a ballot paper in September 2024, when he contested a county council by-election in Freebridge Lynn division.  Lambert is opposed by Green candidate Rob Archer, Reform UK candidate Austen Moore and Liberal Democrat Geri Sayers.

<h2>Frinton</h2>
</p><p>
<em>Tendring council, Essex; caused by the death of councillor Nick Turner.</em>
</p><p>
Staying in East Anglia, we now come to the Clacton constituency represented by the Reform UK leader Nigel Farage.  His seat includes a large swathe of countryside and other seaside towns in the Clacton area, and it's here that we find Frinton-on-Sea to the north-east of Clacton.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/tendring-frinton-2025.webp" alt="Tendring, Frinton" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
The old cliché of "Harwich for the Continent, Frinton for the incontinent" still has a lot of truth to it.  In the 2021 census Frinton ward ranked 7th in England and Wales for residents aged 65 to 84 (39.2%) and 42nd for residents aged 85 or over (7.4%).  Anybody living here who's under 60 is in the bottom half of the age bracket.  An absolute majority of residents (51.8%) are retired, the eighth-highest figure for any ward in England and Wales.  Frinton ales makes the top 20 wards for residents who identify as English only (30.4%) and has the third-highest figure in East Anglia for Christianity (63.0%).  In other words, this is England as it exists in the nostalgia of baby boomers; so perhaps it's fitting that two celebrities who live in Frinton are the Boom Radio presenter Diddy David Hamilton and his fellow DJ Mike Read, who would rather that you forget his notorious composition <em>UKIP Calypso</em>.
</p><p>
For a quarter of a century Frinton's these mostly-elderly residents had been represented on Tendring council by Nick Turner, a hotelier and innkeeper who was first elected as a councillor for Frinton ward in 1999 and sat continuously until his death in March.  He was a member of Tendring council's cabinet from 2010 to 2017, including a period as deputy leader in 2014-15.  Turner was elected on each occasion as a Conservative, but he was a non-aligned councillor at the time of his death having left the party a few months after his last re-election in 2023.  His final term in office was also marred by a controversy over racist remarks he had made in a June 2023 meeting of the Local Government Association's coastal special interest group, for which he was found to have broken Tendring council's code of conduct.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2023/tendring23s.svgz" alt="Tendring, 2023" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Tendring council was hung in the 2023 election, with 19 Conservative councillors, 16 independents, 8 Labour, 4 Lib Dems and one Tendring First councillor returned.  Previous by-elections since 2023 have seen Labour lose a seat to an independent in Bluehouse ward and Reform UK gain a seat from the Conservatives in The Bentleys and Frating ward.  Reform UK have also picked up six other defectors here, mostly from the Conservatives, but they are out of power in Tendring at present: a coalition of most of the independent councillors, Labour and the Lib Dems is currently running the show.
</p><p>
In 2019 Frinton ward split its two seats between the Conservatives' Nick Turner and the localist party Tendring First who have normally finished second in Frinton's local elections in this century, but the Tories pulled away in 2023 to win both seats with 42% of the vote against 31% for Tendring First and 15% for Labour.  On previous boundaries before 2019 Frinton was a safe Conservative ward, and from 2007 to 2019 the other councillor here was the actor Giles Watling who was best known at the time for playing Oswald the vicar in <em>Bread</em>.  Watling subsequently served two terms from 2017 to 2024 as the Conservative MP for Clacton, in between UKIP's Douglas Carswell (who he lost to in the 2014 by-election and 2015) and Reform UK's Nigel Farage.
</p><p>
Defending this seat for the Conservatives is Vanda Watling, who is Giles Watling's wife.  There is no Tendring First candidate this time which puts quite a lot of votes up for grabs.  Labour have selected Karen Creavin who is chief executive of the Actve Wellbeing Society, and also on the ballot are Steven Walker for the Greens, Reform UK's Anne Davis who has previously been elected to Tendring council both on the UKIP ticket and as an independent, and Helen Fontaine for the Lib Dems.  This is an overnight count.

<h2>Burgess Hill North;<br>
Hassocks and Burgess Hill South; and<br>
St Leonard's Forest</h2>
</p><p>
<em>West Sussex county council; caused respectively by the resignations of Liberal Democrat councillors Stuart Condie and Kirsty Lord and Conservative councillor Katie Nagel.</em>
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/w-sussex-cc-burgess-hill-n-2025.webp" alt="W Sussex CC, Burgess Hill N" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
We now consider three polls to West Sussex county council, two of which are in the town of Burgess Hill.  This has benefited from its position on the Brighton Line to grow into the largest town in Mid Sussex district (overtaking East Grinstead), with Wivelsfield and Burgess Hill stations both serving the town.  But commuting is not the only facet of Burgess Hill's economy: Burgess Hill North division includes a series of large business parks which are home to offices for a number of national and international companies.  The pharmaceuticals giant Roche is a particularly large employer.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/w-sussex-cc-hassocks-burgess-hill-n-2025.webp" alt="W Sussex CC, Hassocks/Burgess Hill S" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
The village of Hassocks, further down the Brighton Line in the shadow of the South Downs, is yet to achieve that level of population; but Hassocks has merged with the village of Keymer to the east and the map does show substantial new development under construction on the village's northern edge.  Such development would have to be located there, because the southern and eastern fringes of this division are part of the South Downs National Park.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/w-sussex-cc-st-leonards-forest-2025.webp" alt="W Sussex CC, St Leonard's Forest" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Rather different in character is the rural division of St Leonard's Forest, which is based on three large parishes to the north and east of Horsham together with Roffey, a built-up part of North Horsham parish.  This column was previously here less than two months ago covering a by-election to the Colgate and Rusper ward of Horsham district, which covers most of this division, on 17th April; this time the parish of Lower Beeding to the south joins in the fun.  Lower Beeding is the source of the Sussex Ouse, whose other end we met at Newhaven last week.  For now Roffey Millennium Hall is the largest polling station in this division with 2,730 electors on the roll, although the new Crawley overspill development of Kilnwood Vale is quickly catching up.
</p><p>
The Colgate and Rusper by-election in April was gained by the Liberal Democrats with 30.3% of the vote in a field of five candidates.  By coincidence, that is exactly the same score the party had in the St Leonard's Forest county division in May 2021: however, that 2021 election only had three candidates and 30.3% is not going to be a winning score under those conditions.  Indeed, the Conservative county councillor Katie Nagel was elected then with a comfortable majority of 55-30.  Despite that large majority, the Conservatives may be looking at this by-election with some concern following April's by-election result and the loss of the Horsham parliamentary seat to the Lib Dems last year.  The Lib Dems may also have carried this ward in the 2023 Horsham council elections, although mismatches between the ward and county division boundaries make this difficult to tell for certain.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/west-sussex21s.svgz" alt="W Sussex CC, 2021" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
The other two West Sussex by-elections - which, between them, cover around half of Burgess Hill town - are vacated by Liberal Democrat councillors who had both intended to stand down at the cancelled 2025 county elections and are unable to commit to another year in office.  Kirsty Lord, who cites work commitments for her resignation, was first elected for Hassocks and Burgess Hill South division by twenty votes over the Conservatives in 2017 before increasing her majority to 1,634 votes in 2021; in percentage terms that's 62-26.  Stuart Condie, whose resignation statement had some pungent comments about denial of democracy, had gained Burgess Hill North division from the Conservatives in 2021 by 94 votes: he polled 41% against 38% for the Conservative candidate and 11% for the Green Party.  In the 2023 Mid Sussex elections Hassocks and Burgess Hill South would clearly have voted Lib Dem, while the picture in Burgess Hill North is complicated by the ward boundaries not matching up and by what appear to have been "progressive alliance"-type candidate patterns: of the two wards wholly or mostly in the division, Burgess Hill Leylands returned a Green and a Lib Dem, while Burgess Hill Victoria ward voted strongly for an independent councillor.  Mid Sussex council is hung with a Lib Dem and independent coalition forming the administration, while the council's then deputy leader Alison Bennett gained the Mid Sussex parliamentary seat for the Lib Dems in 2024.
</p><p>
All three of the West Sussex polls today will start counting on Friday morning.  Burgess Hill North is the most marginal of these divisions on paper, so we'll start our discussion of the candidates there.  Defending for the Lib Dems is Jane Davey, a chartered accountant who is chair of governors at the Burgess Hill Academy.  The Conservatives have selected Mustak Miah, a restaurateur who is a district councillor for Burgess Hill Dunstall ward (part of which is in this division).  Standing for the Green Party is Paul Woods, a part-time civil engineer and chair of Burgess Hill U3A.  Also on the Burgess Hill North ballot are Jake Tennant for Labour and Tim Cooper (who was the UKIP candidate here in 2017) for Reform UK.
</p><p>
In Burgess Hill South the Lib Dem defence is led by Erika Woodhurst-Trueman, who is a trustee of the Hassocks Community Organisation.  The Conservatives have turned to the next generation by selecting Eliza-Jane Brazil.  Also standing here are Martin McCabe for Labour (who gives an address in Worthing), Peter Bradshaw for Reform UK and Sue Kelly for the Greens.
</p><p>
Finally, in St Leonard's Forest the defending Conservative candidate is Damien Stuart, a barrister specialising in child protection cases who was an unsuccessful candidate for Horsham council in 2023.  Sam Raby is back for the Lib Dems after finishing as runner-up here in May 2021; in December 2021 he won a Horsham council by-election in Roffey South ward, part of which is in this division, and he was re-elected to Horsham council in 2023.  Also standing in St Leonard's Forest are Sara Loewenthal for Labour and two unsuccessful candidates from the Colgate and Rusper district by-election in April, Andrew Finnegan for the Greens and former Horsham council leader Robert Nye for Reform UK.

<h2>Maiden Erlegh and Whitegates</h2>
</p><p>
<em>Wokingham council, Berkshire; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Norman Jorgensen.</em>
</p><p>
We finish for the week in the town of Reading - or not, as the case may be.  Reading's urban area outgrew its borough boundary long ago, and today's poll in Reading's eastern suburb of Earley is not to Reading council but to Wokingham council.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/wokingham-maiden-erlegh-whitegates-2025.webp" alt="Wokingham, Maiden Erlegh/Whitegates" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Earley railway station, the first stop out of Reading on the railway line towards Wokingham and London Waterloo, lies on the boundary of Maiden Erlegh and Whitegates ward.  The rather old-fashioned spelling of Maiden Erlegh is preserved in the name of the local secondary school, whose former pupils include the journalist and former UK table tennis number one Matthew Syed.  To the north is the Whitegates area which runs town to the River Thames east of Reading town centre.  This used to feature the northern terminus of the A329(M) motorway at Sutton Seeds roundabout, which was built in 1974 with space for a future flyover to extend the motorway to the north.  But plans changed: the motorway to the south has been downgraded to an A-road to allow the hard shoulder to be turned into a bus lane, while the road to the north (and flyover) which was eventually built is a link road to the Thames Valley Business Park, part of which is in this ward.
</p><p>
This rather curiously-shaped ward was created in 2024 from parts of the former Maiden Erlegh ward and the Whitegates part of the old Bulmershe and Whitegates ward.  Looking at the census returns for the old boundaries is not particularly helpful, because the old Maiden Erlegh ward included the main University of Reading campus at Whiteknights and thus had a significant student population.  In 2021 Maiden Erlegh ranked number 4 of the wards in England and Wales for residents working in the information and communication sector, something which may well still be relevant following the boundary changes.
</p><p>
The political history of the former wards is complicated.  Maiden Erlegh was safely Conservative until the EU referendum, after which it became a Conservative-Lib Dem marginal.  Bulmershe and Whitegates featured in this column at a by-election in November 2014, at which point it had councillors from all three of the main parties; on that occasion the Conservatives successfully defended their seat after their former councillor had been prosecuted for benefit fraud and received a disqualifying suspended prison sentence.  After that the Lib Dem vote in Bulmershe and Whitegates ward fell away and it developed into a Conservative-Labour marginal ward.
</p><p>
All three parties clearly fancied their chances in Maiden Erlegh and Whitegates when it was first contested in May 2024, with the candidate list including four outgoing councillors from three different parties for just three available seats.  Someone was going to lose out.  It turned out to be a very close result.  Norman Jorgensen, the remaining Conservative councillor for Maiden Erlegh, was re-elected at the top of the poll with 1,187 votes.  Immediately behind him were the three Liberal Democrat candidates, who included outgoing Maiden Erlegh ward councillors Stephen Newton and Mike Smith: Newton finished second on 1,182 votes, but Smith lost his seat to his running-mate Andy Ng Siu-hong who won the third and final seat with 1,162 votes to Smith's 1,133.  Topline vote shares were 28% each for the Conservative and Liberal Democrat slates, 24% for the Labour slate (headed by outgoing Bulmershe and Whitegates ward councillor Tony Skuse) and 12% for the Green Party.  Labour did bounce back from this disappointment to win the brand-new Earley and Woodley parliamentary seat at the general election two months later.
</p><p>
The ward's Conservative councillor Norman Jorgensen passed away in March at the age of 66.  He was a veteran councillor who had first been elected to Wokingham council in 2007 for Hillside ward: he transferred to Maiden Erlegh ward in 2021 (with his former Hillside ward seat being taken over by his wife Pauline) and was he re-elected here following boundary changes in 2024.  Jorgensen's career on Earley town council went back to the 1980s.  Away from politics Jorgensen's PhD in chemistry led to a career mostly spent in the nuclear industry, which included work on the development of lithium-ion batteries and managing the decommissioning of the Fukushima nuclear reactor in Japan.
</p><p>
Norman Jorgensen's personal vote proved crucial in denying the Liberal Democrats a majority on Wokingham council last year.  The Lib Dems finished with 27 seats, half of the council, against 19 Conservatives and 8 Labour councillors; they currently have control via the casting vote of the mayor, Carol Jewell, but a gain in this by-election would give the party an overall majority.  So the stakes here are high.
</p><p>
Defending this seat for the Conservatives is Guy Grandison, who is an account manager and Earley town councillor; he represented the old Maiden Erleigh ward on Wokingham council from 2018 to 2022 when he stood down, and he contested Hawkedon ward in 2024.  On Grandison's retirement in 2022 his Maiden Erlegh ward seat went to the Lib Dems' Mike Smith, who lost his seat here in 2024 as stated and is back for another go; Smith is also a town councillor and he was mayor of Earley in 2024-25.  Labour's Andy Croy, who works as an accountant and was Labour's parliamentary candidate for Wokingham in 2015 and 2017, represented Bulmershe and Whitegates ward on Wokingham council from 2016 to 2024 and was at one point the only Labour member of the council; he is now a Wokingham town councillor and he unsuccessfully sought re-election to the borough council in Wokingham's Wescott ward last year.  Returning from the 2024 election here is Green Party candidate Samuel Langlois, who came to Reading from his native France in 2012 and works in the weather forecasting sector.  Also on the ballot are Sara Gillman for the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition and Andrew Harris for Reform UK.  This is an overnight count.
