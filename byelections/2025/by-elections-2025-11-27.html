Before we start this week, I regret that last week's Previews have generated an entry for Correction Corner.  Contrary to my statement that the Conservatives are continuing to run Dumfries and Galloway council as a minority, in fact the Conservative administration resigned in June following the split which created the council's Novantae group.  A special meeting of the full council then elected the Scottish National Party's Stephen Thompson as leader by 16 votes to 10, and he has formed a minority SNP administration.  It's the second time that Thompson has served as Dumfries and Galloway's leader in this council term: he had previously resigned in 2023 after losing a budget vote.

Three by-elections on 27th November 2025:

<h2>Hunstanton</h2>

King's Lynn and West Norfolk council; caused by the resignation of independent councillor Paul Beal.

It's a quieter week than usual in Andrew's Previews with just three by-elections taking place.  We'll start in a rather unusual location on the east coast of England, because the Norfolk seaside resort of Hunstanton is located in the county's north-west corner and its seafront faces west towards the Wash.  Modern Hunstanton is effectively a Victorian New Town, founded in the 19th century by Henry Styleman le Strange.  In 1839 he inherited the nearby country house of Hunstanton Hall, and seven years later Styleman le Strange had enough capital to start developing the area to the south of Hunstanton village as a bathing resort.

Development of New Hunstanton was initially slow to get going, but the completion of the railway from King's Lynn in 1862 speeded things up.  Eventually New Hunstanton town was renamed as simply Hunstanton, and the original village (which is not part of this ward) is now known as Old Hunstanton.  Henry Styleman le Strange now has a statue in the town he founded, located outside Hunstanton town hall.

For those here Hunstanton's economy is still based on tourism and day trips to the seaside.  Its proportion of residents employed in the accommodation and food service sector (16.1%) is the highest of any ward in the Eastern region and in the top 30 in England and Wales; the town also makes the top 90 for residents employed in the arts, entertainment and recreation (5.7%).  But the main feature of Hunstanton's census return is that it's an elephant's graveyard.  In the 2011 census Hunstanton made the top 40 wards in England and Wales for residents aged 65-84 (35.8%) and the top 30 for residents aged 85 or over (8.2%); less than 30% of the 4,235 people who live here were aged under 45.  It's in the top 30 wards for adults who are retired, at 48.0%.  And Hunstanton ward makes the top 20 wards in England and Wales for residents with an English only identity (30.8%), a census statistic which is strongly correlated with Reform UK support.

Reform UK didn't a chance to see how that turned into votes at the 2025 Norfolk county elections, because those polls were postponed to 2026.  Despite the town's location on Norfolk's west coast, it's part of the North Coast county council division: this has been in Conservative hands since an independent county councillor retired in 2017.  Until 2013 the county councillor here had been Stephen Bett, who was elected for the Conservatives: but Bett then quit the party in 2012 and he successfully sought election as an independent candidate for Norfolk police and crime commissioner.

The Conservatives also hold the local parliamentary seat of North West Norfolk, which is in the unusual category of having voted Labour in 1997 but Conservative in 2024.  The local MP James Wild was comfortably re-elected last year for his second term of office, and he is now a shadow Treasury frontbencher.

King's Lynn and West Norfolk council, on the other hand, is rather balanced.  The Conservatives lost control here at the 2023 election which returned 21 Conservatives, 18 independents, 11 Labour councillors, 3 Lib Dems and 2 Greens.  In June 2025 Reform UK gained two seats from Labour in by-elections in King's Lynn, and they have also picked up a couple of defectors.  The administration is made up of independent councillors (including onw who has since joined Your Party), Lib Dems and Greens under an independent leader.

The present ward boundaries were introduced in 2019, and at the two elections since then Hunstanton has split its two council seats between the Conservatives and Paul Beal.  Votes ahres in 2023 were 41% for the Conservatives, 35% for Beal and 24% for Labour.

(Robert) Paul Beal was first elected for Hunstanton ward on the Conservative ticket in 2011, but his re-elections in 2019 and 2023 were as an independent candidate.  Away from the council he runs World of Fun, which has been in operation in Hunstanton since 1978 and claims to be Britain's largest joke shop.  Unfortunately the joking eventually has to stop when it comes to your health, and Beal stood down from King's Lynn and West Norfolk council last month on health grounds.

Two new independent candidates have come forward to succeed Beal, and they are the two candidates who finished third and fourth here in 2023.  Howard Johnston is a retired newspaper editor and Hunstanton town coucnillor who stood here on the Conservative slate last time and finished as runner-up, twelve votes behind Beal; while David Nice was an independent candidate in 2023 and placed fourth out of six candidates, thus disproving the old adage that nice guys finish last.  The Conservatives, who hold the ward's other seat, have selected Ade Adeyemo who has held a series of customer service roles in London and East Anglia.  Labour's Christopher Heneghan, who stood in West Winch ward on the far side of King's Lynn in 2023 and is hoping to join his wife Margaret on the council, is a long-serving subeditor for the <em>Grauniad</em> and other newspapers.  Also standing are Tammy Edmunds for the Lib Dems and Reform UK's Fred Pidcock, a former tank commander who is now retired from a career in the oil industry.

<h2>Barnoldswick</h2>

Pendle council, Lancashire; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Mick Strickland.

Our second poll today is in West Craven, part of the Debatable Lands of the Pennines which Lancashire annexed from Yorkshire from 1974.  The West Craven area occupies a natural pass in the Pennines, an area of relatively low ground between Skipton to the east and Colne to the south.  This gap was exploited in the late 18th century with the construction of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, whose section through Foulridge Tunnel opened in 1796.

At the summit of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal we find the town of Barnoldswick, which is pronounced Barlick if you're a local.  Barnoldswick was a small settlement until the canal arrived and turned it into a centre of industry.  As well as the usual Lancashire/Yorkshire textile mills, Barlick is home to Esse stoves who have been in business here since 1854, and to the Silentnight bed and mattress factory.  Another major employer here is Rolls-Royce who have been making jet engines in the town for nearly eight decades: many of Rolls' jet engines have had model numbers beginning with RB, for Rolls Barnoldswick.  All this means that Barnoldswick makes the top 30 wards in England and Wales for residents employed in manufacturing (20.7%); in the North West region, only Marsden and Southfield ward in nearby Nelson ranks higher on that statistic.  The ward also makes the top 70 wards in England and Wales for terraced housing, at 62.3% of households.

It's fair to say that industrial relations in Barlick have not always been smooth.  The Silentnight factory holds the record for the UK's longest strike, with Furniture, Timber and Allied Trades Union members walking out for 18 months in 1985-87 following a lockout by management.

At the time of the strike Silentnight was run Tom Clarke, who was reputedly the UK's highest-paid company director: he was also heavily involved in the Skipton branch of the Conservative Party, and until 1983 Barnoldswick was part of the Skipton constituency.  Since then the town has been linked with Colne for parliamentary purposes, currently as part of the Pendle and Clitheroe constituency.  This seat was narrowly won in 2024 by former policeman Jonathan Hinder, who defeated the outgoing Conservative MP for Pendle Andrew Stephenson by 902 votes.

But the Labour party does not hold a single seat on Pendle council.  The entire Labour group walked out of the party just before the 2024 local elections, which saw Labour lose all five seats it was notinoally defending to independent candidates.  In many cases, the outgoing ex-Labour councillors were re-elected under their new colours.  Two subsequent by-elections in Vivary Bridge ward in Colne saw Conservative losses, to the Lib Dems in March this year and then to Reform UK in May: this has left the council consisting of 12 independent councillors, 11 Conservatives, 8 Lib Dems plus this vacancy, and that one seat for Reform UK.  A coalition of the Liberal Democrats and the ex-Labour independents is running the show.

The Reform UK by-election gain came on the same day as the Lancashire county elections, in which Barnoldswick is the main town in the large Pendle Rural county division: this also takes in Earby, Foulridge, Trawden and eastern parts of Colne, and it returns two Lancashire county councillors.  In May Pendle Rural split its two seats between the Lib Dems' David Whipp, who is now the leader of Pendle council, and Reform UK's Nathan McCollum; they both gained their seats from the Conservaitves.

Despite the importance of manufacturing to the town's economy, Labour are not a major factor in Barnoldswick's local elections.  In this century the town has traditionally been fought between the Lib Dems and the Conservatives, with the Liberal Democrats normally having the upper hand.

The present Barnoldswick ward was created in 2021 and covers most of the town (but not the industrial area along the canal to the east of it) plus the former parish of Bracewell and Brogden, which was abolished in 2023 and is now part of Barnoldswick parish.  It is an expanded version of the former Craven ward, which normally voted Lib Dem but also had a personal vote for Cosnervative councillor Jenny Purcell who had served since 2011.  Purcell was re-elected in the 2021 elections preserving the split of 2 Lib Dems and 1 Conservative councillor, but she then lost her seat to the Lib Dems' Mick Strickland in 2023.

In 2024 the Liberal Democrats enjoyed a 58-22 lead over the Conservatives in Barnoldswick ward.  The winner on that occasion was Lola Whipp, who is David Whipp's daughter.  At the time of her first election in 2018, Whipp was 19 years old and was the youngest councillor in East Lancashire.  Lola was assigned male at birth, and at the time of her last re-election she was still using her previous forename of Tom.  The Local Elections Archive Project's policy on transgender candidates, or anybody else who changes their name for whatever reason, is to continue to record in the election result the name under which that person stood at the time of the election: so the "Previous results in detail" link below shows Tom Whipp as a Liberal Democrat candidate for Barnoldswick in 2021 and 2024 because that was the name printed on the ballot papers and recorded on the Declaration of Result of Poll.  Should Lola Whipp seek election in the future, then the Local Elections Archive Project would use that name for her future election results.

Ms Whipp will no doubt be busy in this this by-election campaign to replace Liberal Democrat councillor Mick Strickland, a former firefighter who resigned from the council last month due to work commitments.  The defending Lib Dem candidate Bryony Hartley, a mother-of-three who is standing for election for the first time, is the niece of former Lib Dem councillor for this ward Ken Hartley and is hoping to pick up where her late uncle left off.  The Conservatives' Jane Pratt, who was an unsuccessful candidate for Pendle Rural in May's county elections, has extensive local government experience: Pratt has previously served as a member of Monmmouthshire council (2017-22) and Poole council (2012-15).  In accordance with the Local Elections Archive Project's policy on candidates who change their names, Pratt's win in the November 2012 Branksome East ward by-election is recorded there under her previous name of Jane Thomas.  Also on this ballot are the ward's regular Labour candidate Euan Clouston and Reform UK's Mick Waddington, who was the UKIP candidate for Pendle in the 2015 general election and has stood twice for UKIP since in his home ward of Barrowford.

<h2>Hetton</h2>

Sunderland council, Tyne and Wear; caused by the death of Labour councillor Claire Rowntree.

We finish for the week in the north-east with our Labour defence, on the Durham coalfield.  The village of Hetton-le-Hole was described as "a close-knit community where coal was king and football was religion" by the great Liverpool manager Bob Paisley, who was born into a mining family here in 1919.  Deep mining in Hetton had started here a century before that with the sinking of Hetton Colliery's first shaft.

Hetton has an unusual distinction in transport history.  The colliery owners decided to export their coal by building a waggonway to cover the eight miles from Hetton to the River Wear.  To build it they commissioned George Stephenson, who had already done something similar for the colliery at Killingworth in Northumberland.  Stephenson's resulting railway, opened in 1822, was the first in the world that used no animal power; the wagons were hauled by locomotives on the level stretches and by gravity down the inclines.  His locomotives, as on the Killingworth waggonway, had wheels 4 feet 8 inches apart, which (with the addition of an extra half-inch) remains to this day the standard gauge for most of the world's railways.

Coal is no longer king in Hetton-le-Hole.  The last pit here, Eppleton Colliery, closed in 1986 and most of the spoil tips have been landscaped.  The legacy of coal has left its mark on the census return, with Hetton ward just creeping into the top 100 wards in England and Wales for those born in the UK (98.3\%), but this is now for the most part a post-industrial landscape.

The Hetton ward covers most of Hetton parish at the southern end of the metropolitan county of Tyne and Wear.  It's just to the south of the town of Houghton-le-Spring, off the main road between Durham and Sunderland.  Which brings us to another of Hetton's connections with football at the highest level: Steph Houghton, the former England and Manchester City captain, went to school here.  She pronounces her surname not HAWton but HOHton, as in Houghton-le-Spring.

Steph Houghton might have had her name mispronounced by many pundits during her football career, but election watchers have less of an excuse.  This is because Sunderland council, which is the local authority here, traditionally makes an effort to be first on general election night.  In three of the five elections since the Houghton and Sunderland South seat was created in 2010, it has been the first seat to declare its result.  This was also the case in July 2024, when Labour frontbencher Bridget Phillipson was re-elected for her fifth term as the seat's MP with 47% of the vote, against 29% for Reform UK and 14% for the Conservatives: her result came through at 23:15, just 75 minutes after the close of poll.  Phillipson has served as education secretary since then, and last month she was a rather close runner-up in the Labour Party's deputy leadership election.

Sunderland council get lots of practice at their election night game thanks to the thirds electoral system; but next year's Sunderland election will be an exception to that, because new ward boundaries are coming in and all 75 councillors will be up for re-election at the same time.  This will see Hetton ward cut down in size, with the village of East Rainton on the Houghton-Durham road transferred out.

The present boundaries of Hetton ward were introduced in 2004, and the ward has voted Labour at every election since.  This record has been maintained despite a number of strong challenges from UKIP, who came close to winning in 2012, 2014 and 2019 when the anti-Labour vote was split a number of ways.  In 2021 Labour councillor Doris Turner died, and the resulting by-election saw the Liberal Democrats come from nowhere to take a close second place - but the Lib Dem vote in the ward then disappeared as quickly as it had arrived.  With the exception of that by-election, second place in Hetton at every election in this decade has gone to independent candidate and town councillor David Geddis.  Shares of the vote here in May 2024 were 47% for Labour, 29% for Geddis and 11% for Reform UK.

There were no local elections here this year while Reform UK were running rampant in neighbouring and socially-similar wards of Durham council.  So Sunderland council's ruling Labour group shouldn't need me to tell them that they might have a tricky by-election defence on their hands here following the death of Claire Rowntree, who passed away last month at the age of just 53.  Rowntree had served as a councillor for Hetton ward since 2018 and she was deputy leader of Sunderland council from 2021 to 2024.  She has left her mark on the map, having been one of the people behind the recent conversion of a former golf course to the south of the town into the Elemore country park.

Defending for Labour is Lauren Laws, a student midwife who is standing in her first election.  Independent candidate and Hetton town councillor David Geddis, who has stood here in every election from 2016 onwards and finished second on most of those occasions, is hoping to win here at his ninth attempt.  The Reform UK candidate is Army and RAF veteran Ian McKinley.  Adam Aiston for the Conservatives and Mia Coupland for the Lib Dems complete this candidate list.
