Before we start this week, I regret that last week's Previews have generated an entry for Correction Corner.  Contrary to my statement that the Conservatives are continuing to run Dumfries and Galloway council as a minority, in fact the Conservative administration resigned in June following the split which created the council's Novantae group.  A special meeting of the full council then elected the Scottish National Party's Stephen Thompson as leader by 16 votes to 10, and he has formed a minority SNP administration.  It's the second time that Thompson has served as Dumfries and Galloway's leader in this council term: he had previously resigned in 2023 after losing a budget vote.

Three by-elections on 27th November 2025:

<h2>Hunstanton</h2>

King's Lynn and West Norfolk council; caused by the resignation of independent councillor Paul Beal.

It's a quieter week than usual in Andrew's Previews with just three by-elections taking place.  We'll start in a rather unusual location on the east coast of England, because the Norfolk seaside resort of Hunstanton is located in the county's north-west corner and its seafront faces west towards the Wash.  Modern Hunstanton is effectively a Victorian New Town, founded in the 19th century by Henry Styleman le Strange.  In 1839 he inherited the nearby country house of Hunstanton Hall, and seven years later Styleman le Strange had enough capital to start developing the area to the south of Hunstanton village as a bathing resort.

Development of New Hunstanton was initially slow to get going, but the completion of the railway from King's Lynn in 1862 speeded things up.  Eventually New Hunstanton town was renamed as simply Hunstanton, and the original village (which is not part of this ward) is now known as Old Hunstanton.  Henry Styleman le Strange now has a statue in the town he founded, located outside Hunstanton town hall.

For those here Hunstanton's economy is still based on tourism and day trips to the seaside.  Its proportion of residents employed in the accommodation and food service sector (16.1%) is the highest of any ward in the Eastern region and in the top 30 in England and Wales; the town also makes the top 90 for residents employed in the arts, entertainment and recreation (5.7%).  But the main feature of Hunstanton's census return is that it's an elephant's graveyard.  In the 2011 census Hunstanton made the top 40 wards in England and Wales for residents aged 65-84 (35.8%) and the top 30 for residents aged 85 or over (8.2%); less than 30% of the 4,235 people who live here were aged under 45.  It's in the top 30 wards for adults who are retired, at 48.0%.  And Hunstanton ward makes the top 20 wards in England and Wales for residents with an English only identity (30.8%), a census statistic which is strongly correlated with Reform UK support.

Reform UK didn't a chance to see how that turned into votes at the 2025 Norfolk county elections, because those polls were postponed to 2026.  Despite the town's location on Norfolk's west coast, it's part of the North Coast county council division: this has been in Conservative hands since an independent county councillor retired in 2017.  Until 2013 the county councillor here had been Stephen Bett, who was elected for the Conservatives: but Bett then quit the party in 2012 and he successfully sought election as an independent candidate for Norfolk police and crime commissioner.

The Conservatives also hold the local parliamentary seat of North West Norfolk, which is in the unusual category of having voted Labour in 1997 but Conservative in 2024.  The local MP James Wild was comfortably re-elected last year for his second term of office, and he is now a shadow Treasury frontbencher.

King's Lynn and West Norfolk council, on the other hand, is rather balanced.  The Conservatives lost control here at the 2023 election which returned 21 Conservatives, 18 independents, 11 Labour councillors, 3 Lib Dems and 2 Greens.  In June 2025 Reform UK gained two seats from Labour in by-elections in King's Lynn, and they have also picked up a couple of defectors.  The administration is made up of independent councillors (including onw who has since joined Your Party), Lib Dems and Greens under an independent leader.

The present ward boundaries were introduced in 2019, and at the two elections since then Hunstanton has split its two council seats between the Conservatives and Paul Beal.  Votes ahres in 2023 were 41% for the Conservatives, 35% for Beal and 24% for Labour.

(Robert) Paul Beal was first elected for Hunstanton ward on the Conservative ticket in 2011, but his re-elections in 2019 and 2023 were as an independent candidate.  Away from the council he runs World of Fun, which has been in operation in Hunstanton since 1978 and claims to be Britain's largest joke shop.  Unfortunately the joking eventually has to stop when it comes to your health, and Beal stood down from King's Lynn and West Norfolk council last month on health grounds.

Two new independent candidates have come forward to succeed Beal, and they are the two candidates who finished third and fourth here in 2023.  Howard Johnston is a retired newspaper editor and Hunstanton town coucnillor who stood here on the Conservative slate last time and finished as runner-up, twelve votes behind Beal; while David Nice was an independent candidate in 2023 and placed fourth out of six candidates, thus disproving the old adage that nice guys finish last.  The Conservatives, who hold the ward's other seat, have selected Ade Adeyemo who has held a series of customer service roles in London and East Anglia.  Labour's Christopher Heneghan, who stood in West Winch ward on the far side of King's Lynn in 2023 and is hoping to join his wife Margaret on the council, is a long-serving subeditor for the <em>Grauniad</em> and other newspapers.  Also standing are Tammy Edmunds for the Lib Dems and Reform UK's Fred Pidcock, a former tank commander who is now retired from a career in the oil industry.
