There are four by-elections taking place on 20th March 2025, but before then it's time to officially fire the starting gun on the ordinary 2025 local elections.  Welcome to the Square Mile...
</p><p>
<h2>City of London Corporation</h2>
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/london-old-guildhall.jpg" alt="Guildhall, City of London" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Our first main order of business for the electoral year of 2025 is the general election for the 100 Common Councilmen of the City of London Corporation, the UK local government unit for which the term <em>sui generis</em> gets wheeled out more frequently than any other.
</p><p>
Most of this is due to the historical accident that in ancient times the City of London was the first part of the UK where popular democracy ruled.  One of the four surviving clauses of Magna Carta from the thirteenth century still provides that "the City of London shall have all the old Liberties and Customs which it hath been used to have".  Nobody knows quite how long the City Corporation has been going, but it has been clearly been running London since time immemorial.
</p><p>
That phrase has a specific meaning in English law: "time immemorial" refers to any point in time before the coronation of King Richard I on 3rd September 1189.  On ascending to the throne of England, Richard needed to quickly borrow money from London's businessmen to finance the Third Crusade to the Holy Land, and the City Corporation's price for this was greater autonomy from the Crown.  This resulted in a charter of 1189 which instituted the office of Lord Mayor of London, who would be elected by the City.  The first mayor, Henry fitz Ailwin, served until his death in 1212; subsequent Lord Mayors have been elected for one-year terms in accordance with a charter of King John.  Alistair King was installed in November 2024 as the 696th Lord Mayor of London.
</p><p>
The City of London Corporation has been directly elected since the 14th century, and its unusually democratic nature (for the time) meant that it escaped the first major reorganisation of England's local government effected by the Municipal Corporations Act 1835.  It has similarly escaped every reorganisation since, confirming the City's status as a Quaint British Tradition.  The Corporation has all the powers of the modern-day London Boroughs which surround it, together with some more on top: for example, it is responsible for the City of London Police, which remains independent of the Met.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/city-2025.png" alt="City of London" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
These elections are for the 100 members of the City Corporation's Common Council.  They will not affect the Aldermen of the City, the 25 senior councillors (one for each ward) who are technically elected for life and from whom the Lord Mayors are chosen.  Aldermen are expected to seek re-election every six years and to retire at the age of 70.  In 2019 there were Aldermanic elections in five wards, so we can expect a similar number of contests later this year.  But after that there will be a long fallow period, because the COVID pandemic prevented Aldermanic elections taking place from December 2019 to May 2022.
</p><p>
The 2021 census return found 8,579 residents in the City.  (Later in this week's column we will visit Glasgow <em>wards</em> which are larger than that.)  If we treat the City as one ward, it would rank 5th in England and Wales for households which are flats or apartments (98.0%, behind the two Manchester city centre wards, Nine Elms and Wembley Park which have all seen substantial redevelopment in this century), 5th in England and Wales for residents educated to degree level (74.2% of adults), 4th in England and Wales for households with no access to a car (77.2%), 2nd in England and Wales for higher managerial/administrative/professional occupations (39.7%, behind only Northcote ward in Wandsworth), and number 1 for residents working in professional, scientific and technical activities (23.6%).  The City would also rank in the top 100 wards for those working in financial and insurance activities (19.9%) or the arts and entertainment sector (5.7%), for residents born in Australia and Oceania (2.4%) or the EU-14 states (13.8%), and for the White Other ethnic group (26.9%).
</p><p>
This figure of 8,579 residents is an order of magnitude less than the number of people who lived within the City of London in days gone by.  The 1801 census found 129,000 people within the Square Mile, and the City's population was still over 100,000 in 1861.  The residential headcount then fell away dramatically as the railways made it possible to work in the City while living in less overcrowded conditions elsewhere, businesses and offices took over the available space, and the City consolidated its position as the UK's most important financial centre.  Perhaps half a million people commute to work within the Square Mile, but when business packs up for the day and the workers go home the streets of the City become very empty.
</p><p>
And it's businesses, rather than local residents, who hold the most clout in City elections.  Following reforms enacted by the Blair government and introduced in 2009, the Court of Common Council - the City's main representative body - has continued to have an electorate dominated by businesses.  It's not just residents who are eligible to vote here: sole traders working in the City have a vote, and companies and partnerships are eligible to nominate employees working in the City as voters.  The number of business voters dwarfs the local residents.  The 2009 reforms also introduced quadrennial elections for the Court of Common Council (which had previously been elected annually) and cut its membership to 100 Common Councilmen - a term which the City officially uses regardless of gender, although the more neutral term "councillor" has been catching on in recent years.
</p><p>
Four of the city's 25 ancient wards are designated as "residential" wards where most of the electors are local residents, and they elect 20 Common Councilmen between them.  The residential wards are Queenhithe (covering riverside apartments at the north end of the Millennium Bridge), Portsoken (a rather run-down area close to Aldgate on the City's eastern edge), and Aldersgate and Cripplegate (which together cover the modernist and rather exclusive Barbican estate; Cripplegate ward also has the Golden Late estate).  The remaining 21 wards, returning 80 Common Councilmen, are dominated by business voters; indeed in some of those wards the number of resident voters is in single figures.
</p><p>
Business voting also used to be important in parliamentary elections.  Until 1950 the City of London was not only a parliamentary constituency of its own, but it was the most important of all the seats in the country with four MPs (cut to two by the Third Reform in 1885).  Lord John Russell was an MP for the City during his first term as Prime Minister from 1846 to 1852 (his second term as PM was conducted from the Lords, after he had become the first Earl Russell), while the former Conservative PM Arthur Balfour managed to find a seat here following his defeat in Manchester East at the 1906 general election.  Electoral reforms introduced by the Attlee government, which abolished all forms of plural and business voting outside City Corporation elections, made it untenable for the City to keep even one MP of its own and from 1950 it was merged into a new seat called Cities of London and Westminster; this seat was Conservative until 2024, when it was gained by Labour.
</p><p>
But this Parliamentary history doesn't tell us much about City elections.  These are traditionally fought on a non-partisan basis, and even figures who are prominent party politicians in other places (such as Tony Benn's daughter Emily, who represents Bread Street ward and has stood for Parliament on a number of occasions on the Labour ticket) will normally seek election to the Common Council as independent candidates.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2022/city22s.svgz" alt="City of London, 2022" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
The only major party which officially nominates candidates in City Corporation elections is Labour, which won five seats at the last City elections in March 2022.   (Those elections were postponed from March 2021 due to COVID; these elections will bring the City back onto the previous four-year cycle.)  The 2022 elections also saw seats for two localist slates which are registered with the Electoral Commission, with "Temple and Farringdon Together" winning all ten seats in the City's largest ward of Farringdon Without, and the "Castle Baynard Independents Party" winning seven out of eight seats in Castle Baynard ward.  The one that got away in Castle Baynard three years ago went to Martha Grekos, who is now the ward's Alderwoman and who has endorsed an "Iceni" slate of rival candidates for this election: Castle Baynard ward looks like it will be a closely-fought contest this time.  The other 78 Common Councilmen were elected as non-party candidates.
</p><p>
The independent majority will continue this time, not least because these City elections haven't drummed up much interest.  This is despite the best efforts of the Corporation, which has been trying for some time to encourage new candidates to stand with a "Speak for the City" campaign and associated website (<a href="https://www.speakforthecity.com">link</a>).  It would appear that this has been a dismal failure, because this time 45 of the 100 Common Councilmen faced no opposition in their wards and they were formally declared elected yesterday at their respective Wardmotes - the public meetings which officially kick off the election process.  That's a big increase from the 19 unopposed returns in 2022.
</p><p>
This means that only 11 of the City's 25 wards will actually go to a poll today: the residential wards of Aldersgate, Cripplegate and Portsoken, and the business wards of Bassishaw, Billingsgate, Castle Baynard, Farringdon Within, Farringdon Without, Langbourn, Vintry and Walbrook.  In those wards yesterday's Wardmotes acted as a hustings for today's polls.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/london-st-giles-cripplegate.jpg" alt="St Giles Cripplegate, London" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
The two busiest polling stations in this election will be the churches of St Dunstan-in-the-West (in Farringdon Without ward) and St Giles Cripplegate (above, in Cripplegate ward), with other polling places including the Guildhall (in Bassishaw ward) and the Mansion House (in Walbrook ward).  City election rules state that each ward has to have its own polling station(s) and counting hall within the ward boundary, so the Corporation will have to pay a small fortune hiring in election staff from other London boroughs to administer 11 simultaneous counts.  It's a good thing there are no other elections taking place today in the capital.  Polls are open from 8am to 8pm, and once the count is over the Wardmotes - after being adjourned yesterday - will resume for the declaration of the result.

<h2>Holmwoods and Beare Green</h2>
</p><p>
Mole Valley council, Surrey; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Clayton Wellman.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/mole-vy-holmwoods-beare-grn.png" alt="Mole Valley, Holmwoods/Beare Grn" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Perhaps there may be a few voters in today's City of London elections who commute into London from the hills to the south of Dorking.  Here we find the southern Dorking suburb of North Holmwood, the villages of Mid Holmwood and South Holmwood, and Holmwood railway station (on the Dorking-Horsham line) which is confusingly located in a village now known as Beare Green.  All of these settlements are linked together by the A24 London-Worthing road, while to the west the land rises towards the 965-foot summit of Leith Hill (just outside the ward boundary) which is the highest point in Surrey.
</p><p>
The ward of Holmwoods and Beare Green was created in 2023 from a merger of two previous wards plus territory from the former Leith Hill ward.  Both of the main predecessor wards had a commuter demographic, and in the 2021 census the former Holmwoods ward ranked in the top 100 in England and Wales for residents working in administrative and support services (8.8%).  The smaller Beare Green ward ranked in the top 20 for households which were caravans or mobile or temporary structures (14.4%).
</p><p>
The local authority here is Mole Valley council, which has a Liberal Democrat majority, and Holmwoods and Beare Green is a safe Lib Dem ward as were both of its predecessors.  This column previously covered the old Holmwoods ward in 2015, when two seats were up for election.  Holmwoods was normally a safe Lib Dem ward, but it had narrowly voted for UKIP in 2014; however, the UKIP councillor then resigned after a year in office as he was moving away from the area.  His seat was scheduled to be filled alongside the scheduled Mole Valley council election here in May 2015, but this then had to be postponed after the outgoing Lib Dem councillor Mick Longhurst died during the election campaign.  The rescheduled poll in June 2015 safely returned the Lib Dem slate, with Clayton Wellman gaining the former UKIP seat.  Wellman was subsequently re-elected in Holmwoods ward in 2018 and 2022 and for the expanded Holmwood and Beare Green in 2023 and 2024, on the last occasion polling 45% of the vote against 30% for the Conservatives and 10% for Reform UK.  He had served as Mole Valley's cabinet member for "sustainable economy".
</p><p>
This corner of the Surrey countryside now has a Liberal Democrat MP, with Chris Coghlan - a Mole Valley councillor who had previously been associated with the strongly anti-Brexit Renew Party - being elected in 2024 as the first MP for the Dorking and Horley constituency.  The ward is split between no fewer than three different Surrey county council divisions, of which two are held by the Lib Dems while Dorking Rural (which includes Beare Green) voted Conservative in 2021.  We are not going to get pointers to the 2025 Surrey county council elections from this by-election result, because that county election has been postponed to 2026 pending local government reorganisation.  Plans for this are not notably advanced in Surrey, but the bankruptcy of Woking council and the massive debts of Spelthorne council have clearly left central government thinking that Something Needs To Be Done.  From this a conclusion was apparently drawn that postponing the 2025 Surrey elections is something, therefore we should do it.
</p><p>
With Clayton Wellman leaving the council for personal reasons, the defending Lib Dem candidate in this by-election is Bradley Nelson who lives in North Holmwood and is the chief of staff for Chris Coghlan MP.  The Conservative candidate is Michelle Watson, who was the runner-up here last year and previously represented part of this ward as the councillor for Beare Green from 2015 to 2019.  Reform UK have selected Michael Carter, who lives in South Holmwood and is fighting his first election campaign.  And the Green Party's Lisa Scott has appeared in this column before: she won a 2022 by-election to Mole Valley council in Charlwood ward (<em>Andrew's Previews 2022</em>, page ??) but lost re-election in 2023.

<h2>Bracebridge Heath</h2>
</p><p>
North Kesteven council, Lincolnshire; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Peter Burley.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/n-kesteven-bracebridge-heath.png" alt="N Kesteven, Bracebridge Heath" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Our other English by-election today takes place just to the south of Lincoln.  Bracebridge Heath lies on the Lincoln Cliff overlooking the city from the south, at the point where the main roads to Sleaford and Grantham diverge on their way south of the city.  It is dominated by the former St John's Hospital, which was originally the Lincolnshire County Lunatic Asylum and was still a mental health facility up to its closure in 1989; the buildings have now been turned into apartments.
</p><p>
The present Bracebridge Heath ward was created in 2023 as a cut-down version of the former Bracebridge Heath and Waddington West ward, whose census return was severely skewed by the fact that it included the large RAF Waddington airbase.  The modern ward has a rather different demographic but it's still politically right-wing.  In May 2023, the only previous result on these boundaries, the Conservative slate defeated Labour 58-42 in a straight fight.  North Kesteven council was gained by the Conservatives in 2023, against the national trend.  In 2021, at the last elections to Lincolnshire county council, the Conservatives enjoyed a much larger majority in the Washingborough division which includes this ward.
</p><p>
Bracebridge Heath may be part of the North Kesteven council area, but for parliamentary purposes it has been part of the Lincoln constituency since 1983.  This is a marginal seat which has changed hands at all of the last three elections: in 2024 it was gained for Labour by Hamish Falconer, son of the former Lord Chancellor Lord Falconer, who defeated the outgoing Conservative MP Karl McCartney.  Falconer had previously worked as a diplomat, and he went straight onto the Labour frontbench after his election as a junior minister in the Foreign Office.
</p><p>
So the Conservatives will be looking for a good result in this by-election after the death of their councillor Peter Burley, who passed away in January at the age of 80 following a fall at his home.  He was a long-serving councillor who had represented Bracebridge Heath (with or without Waddington East) continuously since 2007.
</p><p>
Defending this seat for the Conservatives is David Nash.  Labour have selected Funmi Adeyemi who is a regular local election candidate here going back to 2015; she is an NHS pensioner and former anaesthetist.  Also standing on a longer ballot paper than last time are Bracebridge Heath parish councillor Chris Barr as an independent candidate, Stephen Chapman for the Lib Dems, Mark Nind for Reform UK and Christopher Rattigan-Smith for the Greens.

<h2>North East; and<br>
Southside Central</h2>
</p><p>
Glasgow council, Scotland; caused respectively by the disqualification of Mary McNab and the death of James Scanlon.  Both were Labour councillors.
</p><p>
We finish for the week in two wards of the city of Glasgow, one of which is described by the city's tourist board as a location of "charming traditional tenements, expansive parks, and trendy cafés", offering "a delightful blend of nature, creativity, and local culture".
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/glasgow-from-queens-park.jpg" alt="View of Glasgow from Queen's Park" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
That would be Southside Central ward, which covers two rather distinct areas.  At the southern end we have Queen's Park, an open space which was laid out in the 1860s by Glasgow Corporation.  The Queen of the name was Mary, Queen of Scots, who lost the Battle of Langside nearby in 1568.  The park lies on high ground with panoramic views of Glasgow; it also gave its name to Scotland's oldest football club, which was founded in 1867.  Queen's Park currently play in the Scottish Championship, the second tier of Scottish football; their honours include ten Scottish Cup wins (most recently in 1893) and two losing appearances in the English FA Cup final, in 1884 and 1885.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/glasgow-southside-c.png" alt="Glasgow, Southside C" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
The traditional tenements mentioned are concentrated near to Queen's Park in Govanhill and Crosshill, one of the few parts of Glasgow where the old tenement housing of the Victorian and Edwardian eras has generally survived the wrecking ball.  Until they were annexed by Glasgow in 1891 Govanhill and Crosshill were once both separate burghs, which was due to them being divided by the Lanarkshire-Renfrewshire county boundary: Crosshill was in Renfrewshire (and within the East Renfrewshire constituency), while Govanhill was in Lanarkshire (forming a detached part of the Govan constituency).  The two burghs shared a single burgh hall, the Dixon Halls on Cathcart Road, which straddled the burgh and county boundary as can be seen from the map below: the building had entrances on both sides of the county line for legal reasons.  The Dixon Halls still exist, and the building is now an elderly daycare centre.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/dixon-hall-boundary.png" alt="Dixon Halls, with old county boundary" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
To the north the land falls away towards the River Clyde which is the northern boundary of Southside Central ward, and upon crossing the West Coast main line and M74 motorway we come to a rather different area.  Lying on the south bank of the Clyde immediately opposite the city centre and Glasgow Green, the industrial Gorbals was once home to an estimated 90,000 residents.  Many of them were Protestant and Catholic immigrants from Ireland or Jewish immigrants from Russia and eastern Europe, most of them were working in the various industries of the second city of the British Empire.
</p><p>
It says something for how densely-populated the Gorbals was that the Glasgow Gorbals constituency of 1918-55 was entirely contained within the modern Southside Central ward (Govanhill and Crosshill were part of Glasgow Cathcart in those days).  This was a very poor and very left-wing seat which for most of that period was represented by George Buchanan either as a Labour MP or as an Independent Labour Party MP: in 1945 Buchanan polled 80% of the vote here.  He resigned in 1948 to become chairman of the National Assistance Board, and the resulting by-election was won by Labour candidate Alice Cullen who became the first female Catholic MP.  That 1948 by-election saw the Communist candidate, Peter Kerrigan, poll 17% of the vote and save his deposit.  Cullen died in 1969 and the resulting by-election was won by Labour MP Frank McElhone.
</p><p>
During Alice Cullen's time in Parliament the Gorbals was one of the first parts of Glasgow to be targeted for slum clearance, and Hutchesontown in particular lost nearly all of its old tenements in favour of high-rise tower blocks (most of which were shoddily built and have since been demolished in their turn).  One of the few survivors of the old days is the Southern Necropolis, where a quarter of a million Glaswegians lie in eternal rest.  Burials here include Sir Thomas Lipton of Lipton's Tea fame, and the Glasgow architect Alexander "Greek" Thomson.
</p><p>
This column usually wonders at this point about whether the council have a plan in place for when the zombie apocalypse arrives.  In the case of the Southern Necropolis we actually have some sort of answer to this question, thanks to the curious incident of the Gorbals Vampire.  In September 1954 an urban myth had spread in the area that a vampire - apparently seven feet tall with iron fangs - had killed two local children, and on the evening of 23rd September police were called to the Southern Necropolis when hundreds of children aged 14 or younger descended on the cemetery after school to try and find the vampire.  Nothing was found, and the kids eventually dispersed after it started to rain and a local headmaster had told everyone to stop being ridiculous - but the vampire hunters were back in reduced numbers on the following two evenings before everything finally calmed down.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/vampire-with-the-iron-teeth-ps.jpg" alt="Vampire with the Iron Teeth" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Rightly or wrongly, the adults pinned the blame for this mass hysteria on American horror comics, and Alice Cullen MP was particularly outspoken on the subject.  In 1955 Parliament passed the Children and Young Persons (Harmful Publications) Act to ban the sale of comics "portraying the commission of crimes; or acts of violence or cruelty; or incidents of a repulsive or horrible nature" to children, on a penalty of four months in prison or a £1,000 fine.  That Act is still on the statute book today.
</p><p>
So, once all the old houses in the Gorbals and elsewhere in Glasgow were demolished where did the people who lived there go?  Well, Glasgow Corporation's answer back in the day was rehousing in new towns like Cumbernauld or East Kilbride, or new developments on the edge of the city like Castlemilk or Drumchapel.  Perhaps the least successful of Glasgow's postwar housing developments was Easterhouse, which lies in the north-east of the city close to the M8 motorway and is now located within the city's North East ward.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/glasgow-ne.png" alt="Glasgow, North East" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
A large part of the reason for Easterhouse's notoriety is that it was originally built with large amounts of housing but with no amenities to serve all those people.  Glasgow city centre was a long busride away.  If the residents couldn't get to the shops, then Glasgow's businessmen reached the obvious conclusion that the shops should instead come to the people - and into this gap hurtled the stop-me-and-buy-one man.
</p><p>
The humble ice cream van became a lifeline for the people of Easterhouse, turning into an effective general store which served a heck of a lot more than just 99s from its window.  Some of this business was decidedly, er, flakey, and several of the ice cream firms ended up as fronts for organised crime with all the turf wars and gang violence that entailed.
</p><p>
%https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZxEyE4p8I4
</p><p>
The Glasgow Ice Cream Wars culminated in 1984 with an arson attack on an ice cream man's home on the Ruchazie estate, now part of North East ward, in which six people died.  Strathclyde Police's response to the Ice Cream Wars had never been particularly effective, but on this occasion the Serious Chimes Squad seriously messed up their murder investigation: two men were convicted of murder, but they had their convictions quashed by the Court of Session twenty years later.
</p><p>
The Ice Cream Wars have melted away over the years as has Easterhouse's population, which is still measured in hundreds and thousands but has halved since the 1960s.  North East ward also includes the fifteenth-century manor house of Provan Hall, the Hogganfield and Provanmill areas closer to the city centre and one of the few genuine villages within the Glasgow city boundary, Gartloch.  Robroyston railway station, a park-and-ride site opened in 2019, lies on the ward boundary.
</p><p>
All of this population movement meant that the Gorbals disappeared from the Westminster constituency map in 1974, with the old Glasgow Gorbals constituency expanded into a new seat called Glasgow Queen's Park which had rather similar boundaries to the modern Southside Central ward.  (Although, bizarrely, it didn't include all of Queen's Park.)  This seat was represented by the former Gorbals Labour MP Frank McElhone for nearly all of its existence: he died of a heart attack in 1982, aged just 53, and the resulting by-election in December of that year returned his widow Helen McElhone.  Six months later the Glasgow Queen's Park constituency was abolished due to further depopulation, and Helen McElhone was forced to stand down after failing to secure the Labour nomination for the successor seat of Glasgow Central.
</p><p>
In the Scottish Parliament the Glasgow Southside constituency is represented by an SNP MSP who has been ever-present in Holyrood since that Parliament was reconvened in 1999: that's none other than Nicola Sturgeon herself.  Sturgeon was originally a regional MSP for Glasgow before being elected as a constituency MSP for Glasgow Govan in 2007, and she then transferred here in 2011 following boundary changes.  In the 2021 election Sturgeon defeated the Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar for the Southside constituency by the handy margin of 60-31, although Sarwar was elected as a Glasgow regional MSP.  Nicola Sturgeon is now on the backbenches at Holyrood, but the SNP MSP for North East ward is very much part of the Scottish Government: Ivan McKee, the minister for public finance, has represented Glasgow Provan since 2016.  The Scottish National Party also run Glasgow city council, although they are short of a majority and their minority administration is propped up by the Greens.

</p><p>
The modern city of Glasgow has just six Westminster MPs, reduced from seven by the most recent boundary review implemented in 2024, and the old district names have been jettisoned in favour of compass points.  All six of Glasgow's seats were gained by the Labour Party in last year's election.  Southside Central ward is mostly part of the Glasgow East constituency represented by Labour MP John Grady, except for the Queen's Park area which is included in Gordon McKee's Glasgow South seat; before entering politics Grady had a legal career while McKee was a software engineer.  In an outbreak of common sense by the Boundary Commission for Scotland the North East ward of Glasgow is part of the Glasgow North East constituency, which was gained in July 2024 by Labour candidate Maureen Burke.
</p><p>
Burke was a Glasgow city councillor then, and she stepped down from the council in September 2024 to concentrate on her duties in Westminster.  This forced a by-election in the marginal North East ward, which in 2022 had seen Labour win two seats with 44% of the vote and the SNP win one seat with 43%.  When the by-election came in November 2024, with a seriously low turnout, both parties lost ground with first preferences being 34% for Labour, 32% for the SNP and 18% for newcomers Reform UK; once Reform and other parties had been eliminated, new Labour candidate Mary McNab defeated the SNP by a 54-46 margin.
</p><p>
At the time of the by-election, Mary McNab was employed by Glasgow city council.  If this by-election had taken place in England and Wales, then she would not have been eligible to stand - being employed by a council on which you sit as an elected representative is an obvious conflict of interest.  This column has covered more than a few cases of candidates who got caught out by this rule.
</p><p>
But in Scotland, the rules are different.  Following a reform in 2004 you can <em>stand</em> for election to a Scottish council which you are employed by, but if you win then you must resign your council employment either on the day of your election or on the following working day.  Failure to do so results in disqualification from the council.  Section 31A of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, which sets out this rule, further provides that
</p><p>
<blockquote>
"A resignation effected in pursuance of [this section] terminates the holding of the office, employment or other place of profit with immediate effect notwithstanding any contrary provision in the terms and conditions under which the office, employment or place of profit is held."
</blockquote>
</p><p>
It looks like this was the sticking point for Mary McNab, who had recently negotiated a settlement with the council for early retirement and was apparently concerned that she would lose her payoff under this provision.  Maybe this is something that could have been thrashed out with the council's human resources team, but McNab instead decided not to resign from her job.  She was therefore disqualified from the council once the deadline of two working days had expired.
</p><p>
Mary McNab might not have sought legal advice on the matter, but Glasgow council ended up needing to do so.  Nobody had ever previously been disqualified under section 31A, and the returning officer had to seek a declarator from the Sheriff Principal of Glasgow and Strathkelvin, Aisha Anwar, for a ruling on the law before they could safely declare McNab's seat to be vacant.  The time involved in getting this ruling means that the vacancy in North East ward has now gone beyond the usual three-month time limit for a Scottish local by-election.
</p><p>
There are no such shenanigans regarding the Southside Central ward by-election, which follows the death of long-serving Labour councillor James Scanlon in December at the age of 72.  Scanlon was a bailie - a title given by Glasgow and some other Scottish councils to senior councillors which used to be synonymous with "magistrate" but is now simply a courtesy title.  Bailie Scanlon had represented Southside Central ward since its creation in 2007 but he had first been elected back in the first-past-the-post era, serving from 2003 to 2007 as the Labour councillor for Toryglen ward.  (It probably needs to be pointed out here that the name Toryglen does not imply a glen full of Tories.)  He would often act for Toryglen residents even after that area was transferred out of his ward by boundary changes in 2017.  Scanlon's political priorities in his council career - advocacy for better housing and the fight against poverty - reflected the problems that the Gorbals has faced for over a century.
</p><p>
In the four elections to date to Southside Central ward Labour has consistently held two out of four seats, the SNP has always had one and the fourth seat has flipped back and forth between the SNP and the Scottish Green Party.  First preferences here in 2022 were 34% for the SNP, 31% for Labour and 18% for the Greens, but excellent vote balancing between the Labour candidates James Scanlon and Soryia Siddique delivered two Labour seats to one for the SNP: in the final count Scanlon defeated outgoing SNP councillor Mhairi Hunter by 101 votes, with an SNP surplus of 71 votes still to distribute.  Hunter would have beaten any other candidate in a head-to-head, but she didn't have enough first-preference votes to be competitive: a single-seat count of the 2022 votes would see Hunter eliminated in fifth place and would end up with a head-to-head between her SNP running-mate Alexander Belic and Labour's Siddique, with Belic winning by 54-46 after transfers.
</p><p>
So, on paper Southside Central looks like the more difficult Labour defence - particularly given that it's in Nicola Sturgeon's constituency.  The defending Labour candidate here is Samina Rashid, who is standing in her first election.  The SNP have selected Mhairi Hunter, who was previously a councillor for this ward from 2012 to 2022 and wants her seat back.  Standing for the Greens is Laura Vroomen, who is originally from the Netherlands and works as a professional translator: Vroomen has recently moved to Glasgow from London, where she was a candidate for Lambeth council in 2022.  Also standing here are Kyle Park for the Conservatives, Olivia Murphy for the Scottish Socialist Party, Nicholas Budgen for the Lib Dems, Travis Power for UKIP and Danny Raja for Reform UK.  Slightly surprisingly there is no-one on the ballot from Alba, who had a relatively good result in Southside Central ward in 2022 with 8.1%.
</p><p>
North East ward looks safer for Labour based on the previous result, but the embarrassing circumstances of this by-election could provoke a backlash from the voters.  Hoping that won't happen is the defending Labour candidate Debbie Duffy, who is definitely not employed by Glasgow council: she works in the care sector.  The SNP candidate Donna McGill is an employability advisor, lecturer and self-employed DJ/karaoke presenter according to her social media.  Reform UK have changed their candidate to Rob Maddison.  Also standing in North East ward are Kyle Cannon for the Conservatives, three returning candidates from November's by-election (Hayley McDonald for the Greens, Anne McAllister for the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition, and Peter McLaughlin for the Lib Dems), and Christopher Ho for UKIP.  The usual Scottish disclaimers apply to both by-elections, with Votes at 16 and the Alternative Vote in use; and don't wait up all night for these results, because Glasgow council will be starting the count on Friday morning.
