<h2>Barnstaple with Westacott</h2>

North Devon council; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Katrina Stevenson.

We will finish a busy month for by-elections with this week's Lib Dem defence, which is in the West Country.  Barnstaple with Westacott ward covers the eastern end of Barnstaple, the largest town in the North Devon district; the ward extends past the local beauty spot of the Whiddon valley into Westacott, which has now merged with Barnstaple's urban area.  Much of the ward is current or former social housing, and in the 2021 census Barnstaple with Westacott made the top 25 wards in England and Wales for part-time employment (17.8%) and the top 70 for semi-routine occupations (18.9%).  Employment here is provided by the Whiddon Valley industrial estate, which includes the main manufacturing base for the pharmaceutical firm Accord Healthcare; Accord's predecessors moved here in 1980 from their previous site in Brighton, lured by grants from central government.

Since last year North Devon's representative in Westminster has been Ian Roome of the Liberal Democrats, who had been leader of the ruling Liberal Democrat group on North Devon council before his election.  In May Roome resigned his North Devon council seat, and the Liberal Democrats held the resulting by-election in Barnstaple with Pilton ward; he also stepped down as the county councillor for Barnstaple North, and the Lib Dems held both that seat and Barnstaple South in May's Devon county council elections.

Both Barnstaple county divisions cover parts of Barnstaple with Westacott ward, which was created in 2019 and has returned a full slate of three Lib Dem councillors at both North Devon council elections since then.  Topline shares of the vote here in 2023 were 40% for the Liberal Democrat slate, 23% for the Conservative candidate, 15% for the Green candidate and 12% for independents.  Elected in third place here in 2023 was Katrina Stevenson, who has stood down from the council halfway through her third term of office.

Defending this seat for the Liberal Democrats is Josh Rutty, who works in "one of Barnstaple's busiest pubs" according to the local party.  Rutty was an unsuccessful candidate for Devon county council in May when he contested Combe Martin Rural division.  The Conservatives have reselected Lisa Mackenzie who was runner-up here in 2023 and was one of the people behind the relaunch of Barnstaple in Bloom; in May she contested Barnstaple North in the county council elections and the Barnstaple with Pilton by-election.  Standing for the Greens this time is David Smale, a musician and manager of a local art gallery who stood in May in the Chulmleigh and Landkey county division which covers a small corner of this ward.  There is no independent candidate this time, so completing the ballot is Reform UK's David Jarvis who has settled in Barnstaple after a career which took him all over the world; in May Jarvis was runner-up in Barnstaple North and the Barnstaple with Pilton by-election.
