Three by-elections on 31st July 2025:

<h2>Bewsey and Whitecross</h2>

Warrington council, Cheshire; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Shireen Mohammed.

We'll start this week by taking an express train out of London towards Glasgow.  In one of the longest non-stop runs on the UK rail network, the first station stop for these trains is 182 miles out of Euston at Warrington Bank Quay.  For many years this was one of the UK's bleaker mainline railway stations, overlooked by a large Unilever factory which made washing powder; but this factory closed down in 2020 and is now scheduled for demolition, if it hasn't gone already.

To the south of Bank Quay station is Centre Park, a business and industrial area located within a bend of the River Mersey; the Centre Park Link Bridge at the southern end of the ward is the Mersey's lowest toll-free road crossing.  Rail travellers arriving at Warrington from the south will also pass the rusting skeleton of the Warrington Transporter Bridge, which was opened in 1916 by Joseph Crosfield and Son to connect together parts of their soap and chemical works which lay on both sides of the Mersey.  This bridge fell into disuse in 1964.

North of here we find Whitecross, a residential area located around Warrington Hospital which is the main general hospital for the town.  Running up the Sankey valley here from here brings us to Bewsey, an inter-war residential area, and then to the later suburb of Dallam which is sandwiched between the Sankey and the West Coast Main Line.  Until recently Royal Mail had a large rail terminal here, and while this is now defunct the area around it - located between the railway and the A49 Winwick Road - is still a hive of industry and retail all the way down to the Halliwell Jones stadium.  This has been the home of the Super League team Warrington Wolves since 2004, and the stadium also hosted four matches in the <s>2021</s> 2022 Rugby League World Cup, including a quarter-final where Samoa beat Tonga 20-18.

The Wire's ground lies just to the north of Warrington town centre, which is doing relatively well in this age of High Street armageddon; perhaps it's not a coincidence that Bewsey and Whitecross just sneaks into the top 100 wards in England and Wales for people employed in the wholesale and retail sector.  Not far to the west of the town centre is Warrington's town hall, an old mansion which was built in 1750 for the Patten family and is still set in its origianl parkland; the town hall and Bank Park can be found behind an impressively ornate set of gates which were donated to the town in 1895.

Warrington town centre has a strategic location at what was once the lowest crossing-point of the Mersey.  There was a Roman bridge somewhere near the modern Warrington Bridge, a roundabout which spans the river; and not far from Warrington Bridge back in the day was an Augustinian friary.  One of its scholars, one Friar Penketh, was mentioned in Shakespeare's <em>Richard III</em>.

Today the site of this friary is a Wetherspoon's pub called the Friar Penketh, where your columnist has drunk on a few occasions.  In 2019 the Friar Penketh hit the headlines for all the wrong reasons, after it was revealed that in July 2017 several people associated with the banned neo-Nazi group National Action had met there including a young man called Jack Renshaw, who appears in the archives of the Local Elections Archive Project: while he was a teenager, Renshaw had stood for the BNP in a 2014 by-election to Blackpool council.  Renshaw was under police investigation at the time on suspicion of stirring up racial hatred (which he was charged with a few days later) and internet grooming.  

In the pub that Saturday, Jack Renshaw outlined to his companions a plot to kill his local MP Rosie Cooper.  Unbeknownst to him, one of the people round the table had passing information to the anti-fascist group Hope Not Hate: the alarm was quickly raised, and Renshaw was arrested and remanded in custody.  Over four trials in 2018 and 2019, Renshaw was convicted of the racial hatred and internet grooming offences, and he then pleaded guilty to a terrorist offence in making preparations to kill Cooper and to threatening to kill the police officer investigating him; two juries were unable to decide whether Renshaw was still a member of National Action.  He is now serving a life sentence, with a minimum term of 20 years.  Rosie Cooper is still with us, and she continued to serve as an MP until 2022 when she resigned from the Commons to become chair of the Mersey Care NHS Foundation Trust.  The plot to kill her was dramatised in that year as a five-part ITV series called <em>The Walk-In</em>.

The present MP for Bewsey and Whitecross is Labour's Sarah Hall, who has served since July 2024 for the Warrington South constituency; her father-in-law Mike Hall had represented the same seat from 1992 to 1997.  Warrington South has changed hands at each of the last three general elections, but on election night last year it was counted by the media as a Labour hold because boundary changes - which took the town of Lymm out of the seat - had wiped out the majority of the defending Conservative MP Andy Carter.

Sarah Hall had previously served from 2016 to May 2024 as a Labour councillor for Bewsey and Whitecross ward, which is safely part of the Labour majority on Warrington council.  She stood down at the 2024 Warrington council elections and her seat was taken over by new Labour councillor Shireen Mohammed, who stood down last month after a year in office in order to take up a new job with the council.  This job probably pays more than being a councillor, and might also come with less reputational risk: Warrington council was Â£1,800 million in debt as of January 2022, and earlier this month central government lost patience and sent in Ministerial Envoys to try and help the council out of the hole it has dug for itself.

In 2024 the Labour slate won Bewsey and Whitecross with a large lead of 59-21 over the Liberal Democrat candidate.  Defending this large majority is the Labour candidate Maitane Akpan, who works a tutor and is fighting her first election campaign.  The Lib Dems have reselected their 2024 candidate David Crowther, who has several Parliamentary campaigns under his belt (most recently standing in Warrington North last year) and also has local government experience as a St Helens councillor, representing Newton East ward from 1988 to 1996 and then Town Centre ward from 2006 to 2010.  Also on the ballot are the Conservatives' Stephen Taylor and Reform UK's John Roddy.

<h2>Barnstaple with Westacott</h2>

North Devon council; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Katrina Stevenson.

We will finish a busy month for by-elections with this week's Lib Dem defence, which is in the West Country.  Barnstaple with Westacott ward covers the eastern end of Barnstaple, the largest town in the North Devon district; the ward extends past the local beauty spot of the Whiddon valley into Westacott, which has now merged with Barnstaple's urban area.  Much of the ward is current or former social housing, and in the 2021 census Barnstaple with Westacott made the top 25 wards in England and Wales for part-time employment (17.8%) and the top 70 for semi-routine occupations (18.9%).  Employment here is provided by the Whiddon Valley industrial estate, which includes the main manufacturing base for the pharmaceutical firm Accord Healthcare; Accord's predecessors moved here in 1980 from their previous site in Brighton, lured by grants from central government.

Since last year North Devon's representative in Westminster has been Ian Roome of the Liberal Democrats, who had been leader of the ruling Liberal Democrat group on North Devon council before his election.  In May Roome resigned his North Devon council seat, and the Liberal Democrats held the resulting by-election in Barnstaple with Pilton ward; he also stepped down as the county councillor for Barnstaple North, and the Lib Dems held both that seat and Barnstaple South in May's Devon county council elections.

Both Barnstaple county divisions cover parts of Barnstaple with Westacott ward, which was created in 2019 and has returned a full slate of three Lib Dem councillors at both North Devon council elections since then.  Topline shares of the vote here in 2023 were 40% for the Liberal Democrat slate, 23% for the Conservative candidate, 15% for the Green candidate and 12% for independents.  Elected in third place here in 2023 was Katrina Stevenson, who has stood down from the council halfway through her third term of office.

Defending this seat for the Liberal Democrats is Josh Rutty, who works in "one of Barnstaple's busiest pubs" according to the local party.  Rutty was an unsuccessful candidate for Devon county council in May when he contested Combe Martin Rural division.  The Conservatives have reselected Lisa Mackenzie who was runner-up here in 2023 and was one of the people behind the relaunch of Barnstaple in Bloom; in May she contested Barnstaple North in the county council elections and the Barnstaple with Pilton by-election.  Standing for the Greens this time is David Smale, a musician and manager of a local art gallery who stood in May in the Chulmleigh and Landkey county division which covers a small corner of this ward.  There is no independent candidate this time, so completing the ballot is Reform UK's David Jarvis who has settled in Barnstaple after a career which took him all over the world; in May Jarvis was runner-up in Barnstaple North and the Barnstaple with Pilton by-election.
