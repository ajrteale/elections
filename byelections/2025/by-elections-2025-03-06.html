Nine by-elections on 6th March 2025:
</p><p>
<h2>Brentford East: and<br>
Syon and Brentford Lock</h2>
</p><p>
Hounslow council, London; caused by the resignations of Labour councillors Rhys Williams and Balraj Sarai.
</p><p>
Today is likely to be the biggest test of public opinion before the local elections in May, with nine wards going to the polls.  Of these, three are in London, three are in Kent, two are to replace councillors who were elected as MPs last year, and there is one wildcard.
</p><p>

</p><p>
It seems reasonable to start with our London by-elections, two of which take place in adjoining wards on the north bank of the River Thames, opposite Kew Gardens.  Of these, Brentford East ward is closest to central London: it lies to the north and west of Kew Bridge over the Thames, and it is served by Kew Bridge railway station on the Hounslow Loop line.  The ward includes the Musical Museum, which has a large collection of self-playing musical instruments and the musical rolls which control them.  Also here is the London Museum of Water and Steam, which occupies an old waterworks pumping station: its Grand Junction 90-inch beam engine is the largest working engine of its type in the world, and back in the day it was described as a "monster" by none other than Charles Dickens.
</p><p>
Goodness knows what Dickens would have made of the Chiswick flypass, the elevated section of the M4 motorway which lies directly over the Great West Road; or of the highrise council flats of the Haverfield estate.  The latter is adjacent to Brentford FC's old Griffin Park ground: this has now been replaced by the Brentford Community Stadium, located within a triangle of railway lines next to Kew Bridge station.  The Brentford Community Stadium hosted four matches in the UEFA Women's Euro 2022 football tournament, including one quarter-final in which Germany beat Austria 2-0; two further women's international friendly matches were played here in 2023, both involving Australia.  The top-flight rugby team London Irish also played at the Brentford Community Stadium before they went bust in 2023.
</p><p>

</p><p>
There was also a fair amount of industry in Syon and Brentford Lock ward, which includes the Brentford Dock at the confluence of the rivers Thames and Brent; this confluence is also the southern terminus of the Grand Union Canal, which uses the course of the Brent at this point.  The docks themselves, however, were from the railway era: the Great Western Railway had a branch line to Brentford Dock, at which point cargoes could be transferred between railway wagons and Thames barges.  Brentford Dock closed for this purpose in 1964 and was subsequently redeveloped for housing.
</p><p>
However, most of Syon and Brentford Lock ward's acreage is covered by the open space of Syon Park.  This was once the grounds of Syon Abbey, one of England's wealthiest nunneries, which was dissolved in 1539.  The Abbey site was promptly redeveloped as Syon House, and Queen Catherine Howard was imprisoned here in the winter of 1541-42; by the end of the century it had come into the possession of the Percy family, now the Dukes of Northumberland, who still own and run the place.  It was from Syon Park in August 1609 that the astronomer Thomas Harriot made the first drawings of the Moon based on observations from a telescope; Harriot did this four months before Galileo did.
</p><p>
Both of these wards have a rather low White British population, and Brentford East makes the top 100 wards in England and Wales for residents of mixed race.  Syon and Brentford Lock is in the top 100 for the 30-44 age bracket (30.1%), for households in shared ownership (4.4%) and for those working in the information and communication sector (12.2%).
</p><p>
The boundary of Brentford and Syon Lock ward runs along the High Street, and just on the far side of the line is the Brentford Monument which marks four events in history that took place here.  Specifically, those were Julius Caesar's crossing of the Thames in 54 BC; the 781 Council of Brentford where a dispute between Offa, king of Mercia, and the Bishop of Worcester was settled; the 1016 Battle of Brentford in which the forces of King Edward Ironside defeated a Danish invading force under Cnut but sustained heavy losses in the process; and the 1642 Battle of Brentford which was a win for the Royalist forces in the English Civil War and in which the Parliamentarian commander John Lilburne was captured.
</p><p>
Parliament eventually won that particular argument, and from 1700 Brentford became the polling place for the two MPs for Middlesex.  Normally the polling station for county MPs in those days would be the county town, but Middlesex never really had a county town; presumably Brentford was an easier place for all the electors to get to than Hampstead Heath, which was the previous polling place.  Elections here in the eighteenth century were often rowdy and disorderly events, perhaps none more so than in 1768-69 when the Middlesex election affair gripped British politics.
</p><p>
The prime mover in the Middlesex election affair was John Wilkes, whose talent for charming anyone who spoke to him overcame a reputation (thanks to an unsightly squint) as the ugliest man in England.  Wilkes was a radical journalist who had made enemies of both George III and the Earl of Sandwich.  In 1763 the King had been affronted by a critical editorial written by Wilkes in issue no 45 of his newspaper <em>The North Briton</em>, and he had Wilkes arrested on a charge of seditious libel.  On this occasion Wilkes was saved by the Lord Chief Justice, who ruled that parliamentary privilege protected him: Wilkes was an MP for Aylesbury at the time.  The Commons subsequently changed the rules so that parliamentary privilege did not extend to seditious libel.
</p><p>
The Earl of Sandwich, meanwhile, had found himself on the receiving end of one too many pranks by Wilkes at meetings of the notorious Hellfire Club, which they were both members of.  Legend has it that the Earl had once said to Wilkes "I do not know whether you will die on the gallows or of the pox", to which Wilkes had replied "That depends, my lord, on whether I embrace your lordship's principles or your mistress".  This exchange may be apocryphal, but <em>An Essay on Woman</em>, a pornographic poem co-written by Wilkes and dedicated to Sandwich's mistress Fanny Murray, definitely wasn't.  When <em>An Essay on Woman</em> came out later in 1763 Sandwich saw his chance for revenge, and he read the poem out to the House of Lords which declared the work to be obscene and blasphemous.  Wilkes, who by now had fled into exile in Paris, was found guilty in his absence of obscene libel and seditious libel, and the House of Commons expelled him in 1764 on the grounds that he had become an outlaw.
</p><p>
By March 1768 Wilkes was running out of money and he was forced to return to England, intending to stand for Parliament in that year's general election on an anti-government ticket.  He failed to be elected in the City of London when its result was declared on 25th March, but quickly transferred his attention to the county of Middlesex where he was more successful.  When the poll in Brentford concluded on 28th March, John Wilkes finished in first place with 1,297 votes (or possibly 1,292 votes depending which source you consult).  The Tory MP George Cooke was re-elected with 827 votes, while outgoing Whig MP William Beauchamp-Proctor polled 802 votes and lost his seat.  By the end of the day the words "Wilkes and Liberty" or "No 45" had been chalked on houses and carriages all over Middlesex.
</p><p>
All this happened while John Wilkes was still an outlaw.  The government was wary of the strength of public feeling in favour of Wilkes, and so far it had declined to arrest him so that he could face the music over his libel convictions from four years previously.  So Wilkes decided to force the issue first by insisting on his arrest, and then by surrendering himself to the Lord Chief Justice at the earliest opportunity.  After some ludicrous legal manoeuvres Wilkes' outlawry was overturned, and he was sentenced to two years in prison (reduced to 22 months for time served) and fined £1,000.  This sentence led to immediate angry protests on St George's Fields in Southwark, which (after the Riot Act had been read out) were violently put down by Scots Guards soldiers firing into the crowd.  Several people were killed.  Two soldiers were charged with murder, but the charges were thrown out by the grand jury at Surrey Assizes in Guildford.
</p><p>
Shortly afterwards the other MP for Middlesex, George Cooke, died.  In the resulting Middlesex by-election of December 1768 the "Wilkes and Liberty" candidate was John Glynn, the Recorder of Exeter, who had represented Wilkes during his legal troubles.  William Beauchamp-Proctor, who had lost his seat at the general election earlier that year, tried to get it back.  The violence and rioting continued, and on the first day of polling at this by-election the polling station in Brentford was stormed by an armed mob with "Liberty" and "Proctor" written on their hats: a man was killed.  Six days later Glynn was declared the winner, defeating Beauchamp-Proctor by 276 votes.  Beauchamp-Proctor reputedly spent £10,000 on his losing campaign: bribing sufficient voters to win a seat with as many electors as Middlesex was an expensive business.
</p><p>
In the meantime Wilkes was still an MP and was still lobbing rhetorical grenades from his prison cell.  He rejected an offer from the prime minister, the Duke of Grafton, that the government would allow him to take his seat in Parliament if he agreed to be quiet about his treatment.  Wilkes then got caught up in yet another seditious libel case in which he had accused Viscount Weymouth, who was then the Secretary of State for the Northern Department, of inciting the St George's Fields Massacre.  The government now lost patience, and on 3rd February 1769 John Wilkes was expelled from the House by 219 votes to 137.
</p><p>
If the government thought this would put an end to the Wilkes affair, they were proved badly wrong.  Wilkes was immediately elected as an Alderman of the City of London, and he then stood for re-election to Parliament in the by-election caused by his own expulsion.  Two thousand of his supporters turned up at Brentford to vote on 16th February 1769, but they were not needed: faced with this show of public support no-one stood against Wilkes, who was declared elected unopposed.  His election address had stated that "if Ministers can once usurp the power of declaring who shall not be your representative, the next step is very easily and will follow speedily.  It is that of telling you whom you shall send to Parliament."  Those words were prophetic.
</p><p>
The government then raised the stakes, and the very next day the Commons not only expelled Wilkes again but also declared him to be incapable of being elected in the current Parliament: a declaration which meant that anybody who nominated, voted for or administered an election of Wilkes could be held in contempt of Parliament and imprisoned.  Given the number of people involved and the number of places available in Newgate, this was a toothless threat.  Wilkes called this bluff and stood again in the resulting by-election on 16th March 1769.  Again, he was re-elected unopposed.  Again, he was expelled from the Commons the following day.
</p><p>
We go back to the polls in Brentford for yet another Middlesex by-election on 13th April 1769, in which John Wilkes stood for re-election for the third time in as many months.  This time the Grafton ministry ensured that there would be a contested election by throwing their support behind Colonel Henry Luttrell, who was already an MP for the rotten borough of Bossiney in Cornwall.  Luttrell had served with distinction in the Seven Years' War; he also had a reputation as a notorious womaniser, and was on such poor terms with his father Lord Irnham that he once refused a challenge to a duel between them on the grounds that his father was not a gentleman.  (Many years later Luttrell was accused of raping a 12-year-old girl in Dublin, and he avoided prosecution by bribing witnesses to swear that she was already working as a prostitute.)
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/brentford-sweepstakes.png" alt="Brentford Sweepstakes" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
The verdict of the people was clear: Wilkes trounced Luttrell by 1,143 votes to 296.  Two days later the Commons overturned that, by expelling Wilkes yet again and declaring Luttrell to be the winner of the April 1769 Middlesex by-election on the grounds that Wilkes' voters had thrown their votes away.  A public petition from the voters of Middlesex against Luttrell's seating was rejected by the Commons by 221 votes to 152, and that, finally, was the end of the Middlesex election affair.  Tempers were still running high and Luttrell was too scared to appear in the street for several months after the election: he even tried to resign his seat, but his application for the Chiltern Hundreds was rejected.  Once Wilkes got out of prison in 1770 he cultivated his new powerbase in the City of London, and in the autumn of 1774 he was elected as Lord Mayor of London and finally got back his seat in Parliament, being elected unopposed as an MP for Middlesex alongside his lawyer John Glynn in the 1774 general election.  Ironically Wilkes then turned respectable, and he lost most of his popular support after ordering soldiers in the City to fire on the Gordon rioters in 1780.
</p><p>
Two-and-a-half centuries on from all this, rioting and violence are no longer features of UK elections.  To borrow the title of a 2014-18 BBC Three sitcom set in Brentford, instead <em>People Just Do Nothing</em> - particularly at local elections which have a severe turnout problem.  In the 2022 Brentford elections Brentford East ward had a turnout of 28% while the figure for Syon and Brentford Lock was 33%.  Sadly, we can expect lower figures for these by-elections.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2022/hounslow22s.svgz" alt="Hounslow, 2022" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
The local authority for Brentford is the London Borough of Hounslow, which has a large Labour majority that includes both of these wards.  Brentford East was very safe for Labour in 2022, with the party enjoying a 63-19 lead over the Conservatives.  In Syon and Brentford Lock Labour faced a strong challenge in the last local elections from Theo Dennison, who had been a Labour councillor for the previous Syon ward since 2010 and sought re-election as an independent candidate: a rather fragmented result gave 38% to the Labour slate, 21% to Dennison, 16% to the Green candidate and 15% to the Conservative slate.  The outgoing councillor in Syon and Brentford Lock, Balraj Sarai, would have been disqualified for non-attendance had he not resigned first; while in Brentford East, Rhys Williams has vacated his seat for personal reasons and to spend more time with his young family.
</p><p>
Both wards are part of the Brentford and Isleworth parliamentary constituency, which has been represented since 2015 by Labour's Ruth Cadbury who is the chair of the Commons Transport select committee.  In London Assembly elections Hounslow is part of the South West constituency, which was gained by the Liberal Democrats in 2024 despite the fact that the Lib Dems have little or no presence in Hounslow.
</p><p>
In Brentford East the defending Labour candidate is Max Mosley.  No, not that one (the motorsport businessman of that name died in 2021): this Max Mosley is from a different branch of the Mosley family and he works as an economist.  The Conservative candidate Christine Cunniffe is the principal of a private school in Ascot.  Also standing are Rashid Wahab for the Green Party, David Kerr for Reform UK and Bernice Roust for the Lib Dems.
</p><p>
Syon and Brentford Lock promises to be a closer contest.  Here the Labour defence is led by Jennifer Prain, who is a businesswoman in the home textiles industry.  Former independent councillor Theo Dennison is back for another go: he finished a fairly close second in a May 2024 by-election in the neighbouring Brentford West ward and might expect to do better than that on his old home turf.  The Green candidate Freya Summersgill and the Conservatives' Michael Denniss are also back for another go after contesting that by-election; Summersgill went on to save her deposit as the Greens' parliamentary candidate for Brentford and Isleworth in July 2024, while Denniss is a former Hounslow councillor for Chiswick Riverside ward who lost re-election in Brentford West in 2022.  Jack Ballentyne of the Lib Dems and Chinmay Parulekar of Reform UK complete this candidate list.

<h2>Finchley Church End</h2>
</p><p>
Barnet council, London; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Eva Greenspan.
</p><p>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXcpQ_pew6g
</p><p>
For our final by-election of the week in Greater London we travel to Finchley Central, which listeners to the New Vaudeville Band will know is on the Northern line.  However, this has only been true since 1940, whereas the station actually opened in 1867 making it one of the oldest stations on the Underground network.  It was originally a mainline station, on a branch line from Finsbury Park to Edgware which has mostly now been abandoned: the original route is now a dead-end branch to Mill Hill East, whereas Northern Line trains now turn north here towards High Barnet.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/barnet-finchley-church-end-2025.png" alt="Barnet, Finchley Church End" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Finchley Central station lies on the north-eastern boundary of Finchley Church End ward, whose southern boundaries are defined by the A1 and the North Circular Road: travellers entering London by the M1 and A1 will enter the capital's built-up area here.  The once-separate village of Church End is now entirely built up, and possibly the largest remaining open space in this ward is the gardens of Stephens House.  This is run as a museum in memory of its former owner Henry "Inky" Stephens, a businessman who built up the Stephens' Ink company following the sudden death of his father who had developed the eponymous ink.  Inky Stephens served as the Conservative MP for Hornsey, the constituency which then covered Finchley Church End, from an 1887 by-election until 1900; his defeated Liberal opponent in the 1887 by-election was a young businessman called Horatio Bottomley, who is now remembered as a notorious fraudster.
</p><p>
Finchley Church End is now a centre of London's Jewish community, and it ranked at number 11 of the wards in England and Wales for Judaism in the 2021 census (30.2%).  The ward is in the top 30 for residents employed in the real estate sector (4.4%) and it has a generally professional demographic.  In local elections it remains in the Conservative column, with the 2022 Barnet council elections giving 41% to the Conservative slate and 25% each to the Lib Dems and Labour.  Inky Stephens would no doubt approve - as would Margaret Thatcher, who was the MP for Finchley for many years.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2022/barnet22s.svgz" alt="Barnet, 2022" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
But at Parliamentary level Finchley is no longer a Conservative seat.  Since 1997 it has been linked with Golders Green (change at Camden Town, and be prepared to pay a bit more than two-and-sixpence) in a bellwether constituency.  This seat was gained for Labour in 2024 by Sarah Sackman, who was a barrister before entering Parliament and was inserted straight into the frontbench as Solicitor General following her election.  Following a subsequent reshuffle, Sackman is now the minister for courts and legal services.  Her predecessor in this seat, Conservative MP Mike Freer, was a councillor for Finchley Church End ward until he made the step up to Parliament in 2010.
</p><p>
Freer served in that capacity alongside the late Eva Greenspan, who was a veteran of local government. Greenspan served on Barnet council continuously from 1990 until her death in January, and she served as mayor of Barnet in 2006-07.  She had topped the poll in this ward at every election this century, including on the occasions when Freer (who was higher up the ballot paper) was a candidate.  That's normally a sign of a decent personal vote.
</p><p>
Defending this seat for the Conservatives is Josh Mastin-Lee, who describes himself on his social media as a Londoner, lawyer and "naïvely hopeful Arsenal supporter"; he contested Brunswick Park ward in 2022.  The Liberal Democrat candidate James Goldman stood in that election in Woodhouse ward and has since contested a 2023 council by-election in Golders Green (<em>Andrew's Previews 2023</em>, page 68): he finished in last place on both of those occasions and will be hoping for a better result here.  Labour have selected Beverley Kotey, who is a Pilates teacher.  Also on the ballot are David Farbey for the Green Party, former Conservative MEP Brendan Donnelly for Rejoin EU whose signature policy is left as an exercise for the reader, independent candidate Brian Ingram who contested the neighbouring Garden Suburb ward in 2022, and Lisa Rutter for Reform UK.

<h2>Gorrell;<br>
Herne and Broomfield; and<br>
St Stephen's</h2>
</p><p>
Canterbury council, Kent; caused respectively by the resignations of Green Party councillor Steven Wheeler, Conservative councillor Joe Howes and Labour councillor Elizabeth Carr-Ellis.
</p><p>
We now come to three polls in Kent, which are all in the Canterbury city council area.  They represent something for everyone, with three different parties defending the three wards up for election.  Only one of these wards is in the built-up area of Canterbury proper: that's St Stephen's ward, which covers the north of the city.
</p><p>
The eponymous St Stephen's church was founded by Baldwin of Forde, who became Archbishop of Canterbury in 1185 and more or less immediately fell out with the monks of the cathedral chapter.  Baldwin's riposte to this long-running dispute was to start work on a new church at Hackington, a mile or so to the north of the city, which was intended to rival the Cathedral and which would be staffed by priests loyal to him.  The monks of Canterbury then protested to the Pope about this.  (Exactly which Pope they protested to is not clear, as there were several short papal reigns in the late 1180s.)  In 1189 Henry II died and Baldwin crowned his successor, King Richard Cœur de Lion; Richard then forced the archbishop and the monks to come to the negotiating table, and the building work stopped.  Most of the stone which had been delivered to Hackington was instead sent to London and used to build Lambeth Palace, while Archbishop Baldwin himself then left then scene with King Richard to go on the Third Crusade to the Holy Land, from which he did not return.  Despite this St Stephen's church was eventually completed and it is Grade I listed for its historical interest.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/canterbury-st-stephens-2025.png" alt="Canterbury, St Stephen's" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
The modern St Stephen's ward mostly covers the Hales Place estate, which is named after a notable local family.  The University of Kent campus is just outside the ward boundary, and as a result of this St Stephen's makes the top 100 wards in England and Wales for the 18-29 age group (39.6%), for those educated to A-level or equivalent (34.3%), for full-time students (37.4%) and for those working in the education sector (22.8%).
</p><p>
Politically, St Stephen's was closely fought between the Conservatives and Labour in 2015 and 2019 but was then a big Labour win at the 2023 local elections, with Labour polling 55% against 17% for the Lib Dems and 15% for the Greens; the Conservative slate, which was actually defending one of the ward's two seats, finished in last place.  This by-election is to replace Labour councillor Elizabeth Carr-Ellis, who has served since 2023: she was the party's candidate for the faraway Angus and Perthshire Glens at last year's general election, and she is now moving away from Canterbury for personal and professional reasons.
</p><p>
One of the unsuccessful Labour candidates for St Stephen's ward in 2015 was Rosemary Duffield, who subsequently became famous in 2017 when she was elected as the first-ever Labour MP for Canterbury.  She has held that seat ever since.  Rosie Duffield has had a somewhat troubled time in Parliament, becoming increasingly detached from the Labour mainstream on gender issues and having a poor relationship with her constituency party, and she eventually quit Labour in September 2024 to sit as an independent MP.  Apart from a very short period in the Whips office in 2020 from which she was forced to resign after a COVID rules breach, Duffield had been on the backbenches throughout her time in the Parliamentary Labour Party.
</p><p>
Duffield's constituency also includes the town of Whitstable, a port which lies on the north coast of Kent and which has been known for its oysters since Roman times.  In the eighteenth century development got going here with the completion of a turnpike road to Canterbury and the introduction of a ferry service to London, while in 1830 one of the first railways in southern England was opened to link Whitstable harbour with Canterbury.  The Canterbury and Whitstable Railway - often known as the Crab and Winkle from its initials C&WR - was the first railway in the world to issue passenger season tickets, which were introduced in 1834, and its original locomotive <em>Invicta</em> is on display in Whitstable.  Gorrell ward, which takes its name from a local stream, covers Whitstable town centre.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/canterbury-gorrell-2025.png" alt="Canterbury, Gorrell" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
This ward has also swung a long way to the left from being a Conservative/Labour marginal in 2015, but unlike St Stephen's Labour have not had it all their own way here.  The Green Party came a close second in Gorrell ward in May 2019, won a by-election in November 2021 following the resignation of a Labour councillor (<em>Andrew's Previews 2021</em>, page 478) and then followed up that by winning a second seat in the ward in 2023.  In votes the Green lead over Labour here two years ago was 50-40, but that lead is inflated by a personal vote for the by-election winner Clare Turnbull; the three seats in fact split 2-1.  The Green Party are defending this by-election following the resignation of their other councillor, Steven Wheeler, who has stood down due to some unexpected changes in his personal circumstances.
</p><p>
The current composition of Canterbury council has 17 Labour councillors, 9 Lib Dems, 7 Conservatives, 3 Greens and three vacant seats.  A Labour-Lib Dem coalition is currently in control, but if Labour can win all three of these by-elections that would give them a council majority.  The Labour party certainly look competitive in the two wards already discussed: what about the third?
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/canterbury-herne-broomfield-2025.png" alt="Canterbury, Herne/Broomfield" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Well, a few miles to the east of Whitstable we find that third seat up for election in the ward and parish of Herne and Broomfield.  This combines the villages of Herne, Herne Common and Bullockstone with some overspill development from the seaside resort of Herne Bay to the north: the Broomfield part of the name refers to that area.  Herne village gave its name to the town of Herne Bay, which has now eclipsed it.
</p><p>
Herne Bay entered the parliamentary map last year with the creation of the Herne Bay and Sandwich constituency, essentially the successor to the North Thanet seat which had covered a similar area since 1983.  For the last 42 years Herne Bay has been represented in Parliament by Sir Roger Gale, who came to politics from a broadcasting career which started as a pirate DJ on Caroline North.  At 81 years old, Gale is currently the oldest MP; he is one of three survivors from the 1983 intake, along with the Father of the House Sir Edward Leigh and the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.
</p><p>
Like the constituency as a whole, Herne and Broomfield ward is a place where the Conservative has held up despite the carnage around it.  Vote shares here in 2023 were 40% for the Conservative slate, 22% for the Liberal Democrats and 21% for Labour.  One of the outgoing Conservative councillors stood for re-election as an independent without success and the other one, Joe Howes, finished behind his new running-mate despite being higher up the alphabetical ballot paper.  Howes had been first elected in 2011 for Heron ward in Herne Bay before transferring here in 2015 following boundary changes.  He has now stood down on health grounds.
</p><p>
The three wards up for election today are in different divisions of Kent county council.  Herne and Broomfield is covered by the Herne Village and Sturry division which is safely Conservative; the Whitstable West division which includes Gorrell ward was close between the Conservatives and Labour in 2021, while in that year Labour gained the division covering St Stephen's ward, Canterbury City North, from the Conservatives.
</p><p>
All three by-elections have a lineup of five candidates from the five Westminster parties.  In Herne and Broomfield the Conservative defence is led by Grace Paget, who contested West Bay ward in Herne Bay two years ago.  The Labour candidate Lawrence Coomber is the current president of the University of Southampton Students Union and he contested the 2023 and 2024 local elections while studying in that city: Coomber graduated in PPE from Southampton last year, and he is now returning to his native Kent.  The Liberal Democrat candidate Derek Maslin is a former councillor for Wincheap ward in Canterbury city, who didn't seek re-election in 2023.  Also on the ballot are Peter Campbell for the Green Party and Mark Mulvihill for Reform UK: Mulvihill was the RUK candidate for Brighton Pavilion in last year's general election, and he previously stood in 2019 as a Conservative candidate for Thanet council.
</p><p>
St Stephen's ward is defended for Labour by Beth Forrester, who is a public sector lawyer.  The Liberal Democrats have reselected Christopher Palmer, who was a rather distant runner-up in this ward two years ago.  Standing for the Green Party is Jessie Millner, who works in advertising.  The St Stephen's ballot paper is completed by Arjan Taylor for the Conservatives and by former Canterbury Conservative councillor Colin Spooner, who represented Seasalter ward from 2019 to 2023: in 2023 Spooner lost re-election as an independent, while in this poll he has the Reform UK nomination.
</p><p>
Finally we come to the Green Party defence in Gorrell ward, which is led by Stuart Heaver: he is a former naval officer who now works as a journalist and author, and his professional specialism in maritime affairs has presumably helped his political campaign against sewage pollution.  He's up against Labour candidate Valerie Kenny who is a former headteacher and magistrate: she previously represented this ward from 2019 until she lost her seat in 2023.  Also standing in Gorrell are Janet Newcombe for the Conservatives, Nick Parry for the Liberal Democrats and Babychan Thomas for Reform UK.

<h2>Hamble and Netley</h2>
</p><p>
Eastleigh council, Hampshire; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Liz Jarvis.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/eastleigh-hamble-netley-2025.png" alt="Eastleigh, Hamble/Netley" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Our final by-election in the south-east comes on the northern shore of Southampton Water.  This drowned valley is fed by three major rivers: the Test and the Itchen meet at Southampton, while the Hamble estuary enters further east towards the Solent.  Occupying the promontory between Southampton Water and the River Hamble is the village of Hamble-le-Rice, which has a reputation as a posh yachting centre and is the home of the Royal Yachting Association.  In fact Hamble is rather more industrial than that reputation might suggest: it was the location of a flying school during the Second World War, and there is still a large aviation factory here together with an oil terminal and a factory which makes contact lenses.
</p><p>
The military connection continues as we head up the shore towards Southampton and reach the village of Netley.  This dates to 1237 with the foundation of Netley Abbey, a Cistercian monastery which now lies in ruins.  In 1863 Netley's fortunes improved when it became the home of the Royal Victoria Hospital, which at the time was the world's longest building: this was a large military hospital, built in response to the terrible conditions faced by soldiers in the Crimean War.  Netley Hospital was particularly busy during the Second Boer War and the two World Wars, and Sherlock Holmes' sidekick Dr Watson learned his skills as an Army surgeon there.  The hospital closed in 1958 and the main building was nearly all demolished in 1966 - just after it was used the main filming location for Jonathan Miller's BBC TV version of <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>.  Only the chapel remains from the old hospital structure, while some of the outbuildings are now used by Hampshire Constabulary as a training centre.  Hampshire county council now own the old hospital site, and they have turned it into the Royal Victoria Country Park.
</p><p>
The River Hamble joined the parliamentary map last year with the creation of a completely new constituency on the north bank of the Solent and Southampton Water, called Hamble Valley.  This was good news for our second former Southampton University student of the week, Conservative MP Paul Holmes, who had gained the Eastleigh constituency from the Lib Dems in 2019.  The Hamble Valley seat combined much of the southern end of Eastleigh borough, where the Liberal Democrats are strong, with the western part of Fareham borough which has a large Conservative vote.  Holmes made the obvious choice of which seat to contest, and he was re-elected for a second term in 2024 in Hamble Valley while Eastleigh fell to the Liberal Democrats.
</p><p>
The new Lib Dem MP for Eastleigh is Liz Jarvis, who came to the Commons from a career in journalism and from Eastleigh council, where she had represented Hamble and Netley ward since 2022.  Jarvis has now stood down from the council to concentrate on her Westminster duties.  She leaves behind a safe Lib Dem ward on a council with an impregnable Lib Dem majority: in 2024 the Liberal Democrats enjoyed a 60-14 lead over the Conservatives here.  The Liberal Democrats also hold the larger Hamble division of Hampshire county council, which is represented by the long-serving Eastleigh council leader Keith House.
</p><p>
Defending this seat for the Liberal Democrats is a fairly recent recruit to their banner.  Prad Bains' previous election wins came as a Conservative candidate for Havant council and Hampshire county council: he became the youngest-ever mayor of Havant in 2020, and he still represents the Cowplain and Hart Plain county division in Havant which he won as a Conservative candidate in 2021.  Bains was the Liberal Democrat candidate for Hamble Valley at the last general election and he also stood last year for Hampshire police and crime commissioner.  The Conservatives have selected Marley Guthrie, a consultant and Royal Naval Reservist who was a Southampton councillor from 2018 to 2023 and led the Conservative group on that council: he currently sits on Hound parish council, which includes Netley.  Also on the ballot in Hamble and Netley are Chris Rogers for Labour and Russ Kitching for Reform UK.

<h2>Llanddarog</h2>
</p><p>
Carmarthenshire council, West Wales; caused by the resignation of Plaid Cymru councillor Ann Davies.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/carms-llanddarog-2025.png" alt="Sir Gaerfyrddin, Llanddarog" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
We now travel to a very rural part of western Wales.  The Llanddarog division covers two far-flung communities in the centre of Carmarthenshire, some distance to the east of Carmarthen.  Llanddarog itself was on the old road from Carmarthen to Swansea, now bypassed by the A40; the ward runs south and upwards towards Mynydd Cerrig and north and downwards to Llanarthney in the Towy valley.  The ward's largest polling station is at Pontyrhyd to the east of Llanddarog, with 781 electors on the roll.
</p><p>
The Llanddarog ward is centred on the National Botanic Garden of Wales, which was officially opened in 2000 by Prince Charles (as he then was) on the site of what had previously been the grounds of Middleton Hall.  This was the home of Sir William Paxton, who established a successful bank and briefly served as the MP for Carmarthenshire in the 1800s; Paxton erected a tower on a nearby hilltop, dedicated to Lord Nelson.  Middleton Hall was sold off after Paxton's death, and later in the nineteenth century it was the childhood home of Alice Abadam who went on to become a leading suffragist.  The Hall itself was destroyed by fire in 1931 and its site is now occupied by the Great Glasshouse, whose single span is the largest structure of its kind in the world.
</p><p>
The 2021 census return gives Llanddarog a rather old and very white population, and placed the ward in the top 100 in England and Wales for detached households (72.7%) which reflects all the open countryside here.  Rural Carmarthenshire is a stronghold of Plaid Cymru, who took over the Llanddarog seat in 2017 following the retirement of an independent councillor: Plaid councillor (Celia) Ann Davies was elected unopposed in 2017, while in 2022 she polled 84% of the vote in a straight fight with the Liberal Democrats.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2022/carms22s.svgz" alt="Carms, 2022" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Ann Davies, who has run a tenant farm in Llanarthney since 1992, has now gone on to greater things: she was elected last year as the Plaid Cymru MP for Carmarthen (or Caerfyrddin), and she has stood down from the council to concentrate on her duties in London.  The Carmarthen seat would probably have voted Conservative in 2019, but the Government Chief Whip Simon Hart - who stood for re-election here after his Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire seat was abolished - actually finished in third place last year behind Labour.  At Senedd level Llanddarog is part of the Carmarthen East and Dinefwr constituency represented by Adam Price, who led Plaid Cymru into the 2021 Senedd election.  The 2022 Carmarthenshire elections returned a narrow Plaid Cymru majority - 38 seats against 23 Labour councillors and 14 independents - which has since disappeared thanks to a defection loss, and a hold in this by-election would definitely help the county's minority Plaid administration.
</p><p>
Defending this seat for Plaid is Shone Hughes, who is a trustee of Llanarthney village hall - which is one of the polling stations for this by-election.  He is up against Wayne Erasmus for the Welsh nationalist party Gwlad, who will be hoping for a better performance than the two (2) votes he polled in the last Carmarthenshire by-election a year ago<!--Elli 6.3.24-->; Bernard Holton for Reform UK; and Richard Williams for the Conservatives.

<h2>Vivary Bridge</h2>
</p><p>
Pendle council, Lancashire; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Kieran McGladdery.
</p><p>
We now reach the end of the line, not just for this week but in a wider sense because the town of Colne is the point where the motorway and railway line through the Calder Valley terminate.  The railway used to turn north and go on to Skipton, taking advantage of a gap through the Pennines, but no longer does.  A space was left through Colne's north valley for the M65 to pass through the town on its own transpennine route, but this was never built and the motorway instead dumps all its traffic onto a very congested single-carriageway road through the north valley called Vivary Way.  The Leeds and Liverpool Canal avoids the town altogether, instead taking a route through the countryside to the west via Foulridge Tunnel.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/pendle-vivary-bridge-2025.png" alt="Pendle, Vivary Bri" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Vivary Bridge is Colne's northern ward, running from the town centre down into the north valley and up the other side.  It makes the top 100 wards in England and Wales for terraced housing (64.1%) and it has a working-class demographic profile with large numbers of people employed in manufacturing.
</p><p>
If you thought this meant Vivary Bridge would be a Labour ward you would be wrong, because Colne is a strange place.  Labour have only won the ward twice this century, and the last time was back in 2012.  Instead Vivary Bridge has normally been a contest between the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives, with the Tories having the upper hand in recent years.  The Conservatives also represent the ward on Lancashire county council, as part of the Pendle Central division.
</p><p>
There is a clear radical right vote in Vivary Bridge ward, as we can see from the fact that the British National Party finished second here in 2003 (polling over 30%) and again in 2006.  On that occasion the BNP runner-up candidate was Robert Cottage, who was arrested a few months later when police raided his home on Talbot Street in this ward.  Cottage's wife had raised the alarm about his increasingly extremist views and the large quantity of explosive-making chemicals in the house, which the court heard he had intended to use to deter attacks on his property in the event of a civil war which he believed was imminent.  Robert Cottage pleaded guilty to possession of explosives and was sent to prison for two and a half years; after two trials in 2007, he was acquitted of conspiring to cause an explosion.  No terrorism charges were ever brought.  Let this be a lesson on what can happen to you if you go too far down the extremist rabbit-hole.
</p><p>
In more recent times Vivary Bridge has proved to be a bit of a cursed ward, as we can see from the career of outgoing councillor Kieran McGladdery.  He was first elected in this ward in 2021 in third place out of of the three Conservative candidates, meaning that he would need to seek re-election in 2022.  The 2022 election ended up being for two seats following the resignation of Donna Lockwood, and Kieran McGladdery finished in second place seven votes behind his brother Paul: that meant Paul got the four-year term and Kieran would need to finish Lockwood's term and seek re-election in 2023.  The 2023 election then ended up also being for two seats following the resignation of Paul McGladdery, and Kieran McGladdery finished in second place three votes behind his running-mate Tom Ormerod: that meant Ormerod got the four-year term and Kieran would need to finish his brother's term and seek re-election in 2026.
</p><p>
As it happens, Kieran McGladdery submitted his resignation at the end of last year after falling out with the Pendle branch of the Conservatives in a row over taxi safety.  And the next Vivary Bridge by-election is already in the pipeline, after Tom Ormerod was forced to resign last month when it was revealed that he was nearly £4,000 in council tax arrears and he had only attended three council meetings since his election.  So Andrew's Previews will be back in Colne soon.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2024/pendle24s.svgz" alt="Pendle, 2024" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
In May 2024 Vivary Bridge gave 39% of the vote to the Conservatives, 31% to the Liberal Democrats and 23% to Labour.  It's a bit of a miracle that Labour had a candidate here at all last year, because the entire Labour group on Pendle council - including the council leader, Asjad Mahmood - walked out of the party just before the nominations deadline for the local elections and mostly sought re-election as independent candidates.  What was left of Pendle Labour drew a complete blank here in May 2024, and the current composition of Pendle council has 12 independent councillors, 11 Conservatives plus two vacancies, and 8 Lib Dems.  The ex-Labour independent councillors and the Lib Dems run the show in coalition.
</p><p>
Despite all this turmoil, Labour did gain the redrawn Pendle and Clitheroe seat from the Conservatives in last July's general election, with former police officer Jonathan Hinder defeating the former Conservative party chairman Andrew Stephenson by just 902 votes.
</p><p>
Defending this seat for the Conservatives is Sean Kelly, who is the secretary of the party's Pendle and Clitheroe branch.  The Lib Dems have again selected Andy Bell, who was runner-up here in 2024; he is a Colne town councillor who served for 15 years in the Royal Engineers with tours of Bosnia, the Falklands and Iraq.  The Labour candidate Phliip Heyworth is described as a local business owner (although he gives an address in Barrowford) and school governor.  Completing the ballot paper is Nathan McCollum, who previously represented this ward (on different boundaries) as a Conservative councillor from 2016 to 2021 and who now has the Reform UK nomination.
