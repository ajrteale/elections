Seven by-elections on 24th July 2025:

<h2>Borehamwood Brookmeadow</h2>

Hertsmere council, Hertfordshire; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Alan Plancey.

We're going to start this week with a flashback to the general elections of 2015 and 2017.  The BBC has of course been covering general election nights for decades - 1951 is the first year with some surviving footage.  The traditional venue for these shows was studio 1 at Television Centre in the Shepherd's Bush area of West London, which had both the space to build enormous sets for live spectaculars like these and the behind-the-scenes switching equipment required to handle all of the input and output TV, radio and telephone communications which you need to pull off a show like this.

But BBC Television Centre controversially closed down in 2013, which left the BBC with a problem of where to relocate its election night shows to.  The chosen venue for their 2015 and 2017 programmes was the BBC Elstree Centre, which has been the home of <em>EastEnders</em> since 1984 and is located in the middle of the Hertfordshire town of Borehamwood.  (In the same way that most of LA's Hollywood studios are not actually located in Hollywood, the many Elstree film and TV studios are all located in working-class Borehamwood rather than upmarket Elstree.)  All the election night switching equipment was moved here from Shepherd's Bush, and the 2015 and 2017 election night shows (and probably the EU referendum results programme, although I haven't been able to confirm this) came from Studio D at BBC Elstree.  However, the 2019 and 2024 election night shows were broadcast from the more cramped location of New Broadcasting House in central London, and the behind-the-scenes equipment has now gone there.

The history of the BBC Elstree Centre is well chronicled at the <a href="https://tvstudiohistory.co.uk/itv-studios-in-london/elstree-clarendon-road/"><em>TV Studio History</em> website (link)</a>.  This excellent website will take TV viewers down an entire housing estate of memory lanes, you have been warned.  In brief, the site started off in 1914 as a film studio; in 1958 it was bought by the ITV franchise ATV, before the BBC took the place over in 1984.  At the start of this year half of the Elstree site was sold for redevelopment, and studio D - home of those memorable general election nights - is scheduled for demolition in the near future.

My own trip to Studio D came on 10th September 2022.  While Charles III was going through his Accession Council, I was part of a quiz team taking on the <em>Eggheads</em> in a recording for Channel 5.  We didn't win, but we had a good time in the studio - and the <em>Eggheads</em> presenter Jeremy Vine was very complimentary about my elections work.

Sadly out of shot behind the desk in this picture was the fifth member of our team: Nicki's guide dog, James.  (Who, of course, knew all the answers.)  Once we had finished recording, the <em>Eggheads</em> production team had booked a taxi to take Nicki and James straight from the studios to Paddington station - but the Addison Lee taxi driver refused to take the guide dog leaving us to hang around in the BBC's car park for quite a long time while an alternative taxi was ordered.  No, taxi drivers are not allowed to refuse carriage for a guide dog, and I subsequently gave a statement to someone from Transport for London who was looking to prosecute the driver involved.

Transport for London may well regulate that taxi driver, but they are not normally responsible for public transport in Borehamwood which lies outside the Greater London area.  The twin towns of Elstree and Borehamwood instead lie in the middle of the Hertsmere district of Hertfordshire, in between Bushey to the west and Potters Bar to the east.  Hertsmere council are well aware of the importance of the film and TV industry to the local economy, and the council directly owns the Elstree Studios complex on Shenley Road which is the home of <em>Strictly Come Dancing</em>.  In discussions in 2022 over the future of the BBC Elstree Centre, the then Conservative council leader Morris Bright made it clear to the BBC that the council would not support the site being sold off and turned into housing.

The following year the Conservatiees lost control of Hertsmere council to a Labour-Lib Dem coalition, with the 2023 Hertsmere elections returning 16 Conservative councillors, 14 Labour and 9 Lib Dems.  The marginal Borehamwood Brookmeadow ward, which lies to the north of Shenley Road and the Midland railway line, gave 46% of the vote and 2 seats to the Labour slate and 43% and 1 seat to the Conservatives; this represented a Labour gain of 2 seats.

Brookmeadow ward is just over 20% Jewish (it ranked 23rd of the wards in England and Wales for Judaism), and the ward's Conservative councillor Alan Plancey was a long-serving and high-profile rabbi who had overseen the growth of the Borehamwood and Elstree synagogue since 1976.  Following his retirement from that role in 2007, he became an Emeritus Rabbi.  In politics, Plancey had served as a Hertfordshire county councillor from 2013 to 2021 and as a Hertsmere councillor from 2015 until his death in June at the age of 84; he served twice as mayor of Hertsmere, in 2019-20 and 2020-21.  Plancey had been appointed MBE in the 2023 Birthday Honours for political and public service.

The Hertsmere parliamentary seat remained in Conservative hands in 2024, with a strong majority for its NP Oliver Dowden - or Sir Oliver, as he suvsequently became in the Dissolution Honours.  Dowden was Deputy Prime Minister going into the 2024 general election, but he is now on the backbenches.  Brookmeadow ward is split between the two Borehamwood divisions of Hertfordshire county council, both of which were Reform UK gains from Labour in May; most of the ward is in Borehamwood North, where second place went to the outgoing Labour councillor Michelle Vince seeking re-election as an independent candidate.

So this by-election in Borehamwood Brookmeadow looks even more unpredictable than usual.  Defending this seat for the Conservatives is Glenn Briski, who was previously a councillor for this ward from 2019 to 2023 when he lost his seat.  Labour have selected Bala Mere: she is described as a community champion and legal professional.  Alos standing are Rosalind Levine for the Lib Dems, Madalyn Bielfeld for the Greens, Gus Channer (who was an unsuccessful candidate in May's Hertfordshire county elections) for Reform UK, independent candidate Lawrence Stack who contested this ward in 2014 for UKIP and last appeared on a ballot paper as an independent in a 2017 by-election for another Borehamwood ward, and independent candidate Michelle Vince who is a former Labour memebr of both Hertfordshire county council and Hertsmere council; as stated Vince came close to holding her county seat as an independent candidate in May.

<h2>Berkhamsted West</h2>

Dacorum council, Hertfordshire; caused by the death of Liberal Democrat councillor Robert Stewart.

We stay within Hertfordshire for the week's Liberal Democrat defence.  Nestled in the Chiltern hills can be found the town of Berkhamsted, lying in the Bulbourne valley.  This forms a relatively direct route through the Chilterns which is traversed by the ancient road of Akeman Street, the Grand Union Canal and the West Coast Main Line.  There are frequent and fast trains here from Euston, and modern Berkhamsted has turned into something of a commuter town.  Wool trading, which was the town's major industry in mediaeval times, is long gone.

Berkhamsted joined the Parliamentary map in 2024 with the creation of the new Harpenden and Berkhamsted parliamentary seat.  This turned into a big win for the Liberal Democrats, with new MP Victoria Collins polling over 50% of the vote in 2024 - an increasingly rare feat in these fragmented electoral times.  She is now the Lib Dem spokesperson for science, innovation and technology.

Collins' win was no flash in the pan, as her constituency takes in territory from two local government districts which had returned Liberal Democrat majorities in 2023 and 2024 - St Albans and Dacorum.  The Dacorum district, which takes its name from an ancient hundred of Hertfordshire, covers the western end of the county including Berkhamsted and Hemel Hempstead; it was a Lib Dem gain in the 2023 local elections, but a major split in the party has since cost the Lib Dems their majority.

Earlier this year Sally Symington took over as Dacorum's third Lib Dem leader since the party took control in 2023.  She has represented Berkhamsted West ward since she gained her seat from the Conservatives in 2019, and she has served alongside rather a large number of ward colleagues: the ward's other Lib Dem councillor was Nicky Woolner from 2019 until she resigned at the end of 2021, Anne Foster from a February 2022 by-election, then Robert Steawrt from May 2023.  Stewart, who was also the mayor of Berkhamsted, passed away in May at the age of 61 and this by-election is to replace him.

In 2023 the Liberal Democrats enjoyed a 58-23 lead over the Conservativse in Berkhamsted West ward.  The ward is split between two divisions of Hertfordshire county council: in May the Liberal Democrats held Berkhamsted division and gained Bridgewater division from the Conservatives.

A promising starting-point for the defending Lib Dem candidate Will Jankowski, who has previously served on St Albans council: he was elected there in 2021 for Marshalswick South ward, but only served for a year before that ward was broken up in boundary changes.  The Conservative candidate Ben Rolfe is fighting his first election campaign.  Also standing are Jim Lawler for Labour and Rose Sheridan for the Greens.

<h2>Bromley Common and Holwood</h2>

Bromley council, London; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Jonathan Laidlaw.

The last London by-election in Greater London, three weeks ago, saw the Conservatives successfully defend one of their few remaining safe wards in Inner London in Fulham Town.  More on that story later.  This week we shall see if the Tories can repeat that trick in Outer London.

The road known as Bromley Common is part of the A21, running south-east from Bromley town centre on its way towards Tunbridge Wells and Hastings.  This road ran through open land until the 19th century, and the common was noted as a haunt of highwaymen and as the home of Bromley Cricket Club, which was one of the strongest teams in England during the mid-18th century.  Today the old common is a built-up area known as Chatterton Village, after the 18th-century romantic poet Thomas Chatterton who committed suicide at the age of 17; despite this, Chatterton (who was born in Bristol and died in London) doesn't seem to have had any connection with Bromley.

The Bromley Common and Holwood ward runs south through the village of Keston Mark (named after a now-closed pub) to take in Holwood Park.  This was once the grounds of Holwood House, which was the country estate of William Pitt the Younger while he was Prime Miniester.  Pitt's house burned down in the early 19th century and was replaced by a grander Holwood House erected in the 1820s by Decimus Burton; this mansion was put up for sale earlier this year, with an asking price of £23½ million.  The grounds of the park include the dead remains of the Wilberforce Oak, under whose shade Pitt and William Wilberforce discussed the abolition of slavery in 1788.  A new oak tree, a grandson of the original one, is growing nearby.

Since 2006 the oak tree has been the logo of the Conservative Party, which lays claim to the political legacy of Pitt and represents this area at all levels of government.  Mind, the Tories had a close call here in the 2024 general election when Bromley Common and Holwood ward was transferred into the Bromley and Biggin Hill constituency; this was held by the Conservatives' new candidate Peter Fortune by just 302 votes.  Fortune had previously been deputy leader of the Conservative group on the London Assembly where he represented the safe-Conservative seat of Bexley and Bromley.  That seat's three previous AMs (Bob Neill, James Cleverly and Gareth Bacon) all went on to become MPs, so keep an eye out for Bexley and Bromley's current incumbent Thomas Turrell as a potential star of the future.

Bromley Common and Holwood ward is part of the Conservative majority on Bromley council.  It was created in 2022 as a cut-down version of the former Bromley Common and Keston ward, with Keston itself transferred into a neighbouring ward.  Shares of the vote here in 2022 were 41% for the Conservative slate, 29% for Labour and 16% for the Liberal Democrats.  The Conservative slate in 2022 included Jonathan Laidlaw who was elected for his first term of office, but Laidlaw subsequently quit the party in 2023 and he was sitting as an independent councillor when he passed away last month.

Defending this seat for the Conservatives is Ian Payne, a retired Salvation Army officer who is seeking to return to Bromley council after some years away: Payne previosuly represented Chislehurst ward from 2010 to 2018, and he was mayor of the borough in 2016-17.  The Labour candidate Elizabeth Morgan is described as "having held senior roles in finance and technology across both government and the private sector, most recently as COO for a local technology company".  She is fighting her first election campaign as is Laura McCracken of the Lib Dems, who has dual British and US citizenship and has settled in Bromley after working all over the world in the fintech industry.  Also on the ballot are Ruth Fabricant for the Greens and Alan Cook for Reform UK, who will be hoping to become the party's first elected councillor in Greater London.

<h2>Swanage</h2>

Dorset council; caused by the death of Conservative councillor William Trite.

The school summer holidays are now in full swing, so let's follow the crowds to the Jurassic coast of Dorset.  This coast has its eastern terminus at Swanage, a small seaside resort oLocaon the so-called Isle of Purbeck which has traded on its geology for centuries: most recently in the form of tourism, but historically via quarrying.

Purbeck limestone and Purbeck marble have been in demand as building material for centuries, particularly in the pavements and buildings of London.  From 1822 onwards much of the business of quarrying and shipping this stone from Dorset to the capital was undertaken by the firm of John Mowlem and Company which quickly grew into one of the UK's most prominent construction companies.  The eponymous John Mowlem was a Swanage man himself, and his philanthropic work for his home town included the erection here in Swanage of a number of monuments of London past - which were apparently brought here as ballast for the firm's barges on their journey from London.  This includes the 17th-century façade of the Mercers' Hall, which was moved here in 1860 and now forms the façade of Swanage Town Hall.

The town hall is still home to Swanage town council, but local government here is now administered from Dorchester following a reorganisation in 2019 which saw Purbeck council disappear.  Dorset council is still on a transitional electoral cycle resulting from that reorganiation: the winners of the most recent council election here in 2024 have a five-year term and will not need to seek re-election until 2029.  Last year's Dorset council elections saw the Lib Dems gain overall control of the council from the Conservatives, with 42 seats against 30 Conservatives, 4 Greens, 4 Independents for Dorset and 2 Labour councillors; however, it appears that the Lib Dems have decided to form a coalition administration with the Greens, which would give the council administration a more secure majority.

At Parliamentary level the Isle of Purbeck joins the urban area of Weymouth and Portland to form the South Dorset constituency, which is the only seat in the UK whose status as a bellwether goes back to 2001 but no further: South Dorset was the only seat which Labour gained from the Conservatives in Blair's second landslide.  In July 2024 the Tories' Richard Plunkett-Ernle-Erle-Drax was defeated by Labour candidate Lloyd Hatton, who is a Weymouth man but had cut his political teeth on Camden council in London.

This places Swanage in the minority at both county and constituency level, as in the May 2024 Dorset elections the town re-elected its two Conservative councillors Gary Suttle and William Trite.  However, the Tory share was cut to 36% against 31% for Labour and 19% for an independent slate; the Labour score is inflated by a clear personal vote for Debby Monkhouse.

Until his death in May at the age of 77, Bill Trite was a long-serving councillor who had served on the present Dorset council since its establishment in 2019.  He previosuly sat on the old Purbeck council, representing Swanage North ward, from 1996 until abolition.  His service on Swanage town council went back to 1991, and he served three consecutive terms as mayor of the town from 2010 to 2013.  He was also a trustee and former chairman of the Swanage Railway, which runs preserved locomotives and rolling stock between Swanage and Wareham.

Defending the resulting by-election for the Conservatives is Chris Tomes, who is the current deputy mayor of Swanage.  Labour's Gemma Simmons will be hoping to take over the personal vote of the party's 2024 candidate Debby Monkhouse, who has recently stood down from the town council; this poll is being combined with town council by-elections to replace both Monkhouse and Trute.  Philip Eades, a former pub landlord who was a Liberal Democrat councillor in Poole from 2003 to 2019 and was a defeated independent candidate for this ward in both 2019 and 2024, is standing again and this time he has the nomination of the Independents for Dorset group.  Also on the ballot are the official Lib Dem candidate Poppy Maltby and town councillor John Lejeune, who was elected in 2024 as a Conservative but is now standing for Reform UK.

<h2>Llanrumney</h2>

Cardiff council, South Wales; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Heather Joyce.

Our Welsh poll this week is in the east of the capital.  The name of Llanrumney is not like the many Llan- names in Wales which ultimately trace back to churches: it's a corruption of the Welsh <em>glan Rhymni</em>, referring to its location on the banks of the River Rhymney which is the western boundary of this ward.  The original sense is preserved in the name of the Glan-yr-Afon primary school next to the river, while this ward also includes Cardiff University's playing fields.

The oldest building here is the Llanrumney Hall, which dates from 1450 and was originally the area's manor house.  In the 17th century the hall was the home of the Morgan family and it is said be to the birthplace of one Harri Morgan whose ghost reputedly haunts the hall.  Harri Morgan ended up as Sir Henry Morgan, lieutenant governor of Jamaica and owner of three large sugar plantations on that island, which he had bought with the proceeds of privateering on the Spanish Main.  He is probably best-known nowadays as the Morgan in Captain Morgan rum.  Llanrumney Hall ceased to be a private residence in 1934 when the land around it was developed for council housing by Cardiff Corporation; after some years as a pub, it's now used as a community hub.

Llanrumney's elected representatives in the Westminster and Welsh Parliaments are high-profile figures.  Since 2011 the Senedd memnber for Cardiff South and Penarth has been Labour's Vaughan Gething, who had his 15 minutes of fame as First Minister and Welsh Labour leader last year; Gething had previously been on the Labour frontbench since 2016, including serving as the Welsh minister for health and social services during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Boundary changes for the 2024 Westmisnter election transferred Llanrumney into a new Cardiff East constituency, which returned the previous Cardiff Central MP Jo Stevens; she holds the cabinet role of Welsh secretary.  In 2026 Cardiff East will form half of the new Caerdydd Ffynnon Taf Senedd constituency, electing six MSs by proportional representation: the votes cast in the 2024 Westminster election here would give three seats for Labour and one each for the Conservatives, Reform UK and the Lib Dems.

In Cardiff council elections Llanrumney is a safe Labour ward and part of the Labour council majority.  Shares of the vote here in 2022 were 57% for Labour and 17% for the Conservatives.  Since 2008 the Labour slate here had included Heather Joyce, who was leader of Cardiff council from 2012 to 2014.  She has now stepped down on health grounds.

Defending for Labour is Lexi Pocknell, who was an unsuccessful candidate in the 2022 Cardiff elections when she stood in Pentyrch and St Fagans; she can expect to do better here in her home ward.  The Conservatives have selected Ffin Elliott, who graduated from university last year and is currently working for a right-wing think tank.  Also standing are David Fitzpatrick for the Greens, Joseph Gnagbo for Plaid Cymru, Wayne Street for the Lib Dems and Sidney Malik for Reform UK.  In the 2022 Cardiff elections Plaid Cymru and the Wales Green Party had a joint slate, but it would appear from this candidate list that that arrangement is no longer in effect.

<h2>Alrewas and Fradley</h2>

Lichfield council, Staffordshire; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Mike Wilcox.

We'll finish with two polls in the Midlands, both of which are in areas which have seen a lot of population growth in this century.  New development in the Staffordshire village of Fradley has been aided by the village's proximity to the A38 dual carriageway between Lichfield and Burton; this takes its arrow-straight alignment from Ryknild Street, a Roman road which it overlies.  There is a canal junction at Fradley where the Coventry Canal meets the Trent and Mersey Canal, and there may be a future railway junction here at the start of High Speed 2 Phase 2; construction of Phase 1 through a corner of this ward is well underway.

Other construction work in this century has seen the former RAF Lichfield airfield turned into a large business park, while housing developments to the north of the former airfield have been ongoing since 2000.  This population growth has turned Fradley into the larger part of Alrewas and Fradley ward.  The old Alrewas and Fradley parish was dissolved in 2009, and a further governance review led to the dissolution of the Fradley and Streethay parish in 2023.  Fradley now stands alone as its own parish.

All this has left Alrewas rather left behind.  This older village is now best known to the outside world as the location of the National Memorial Arboretum, which has been operating here since 2001 and is run by the Royal British Legion.  The Arboretum is built on reclaimed gravel workings next to the confluence of the Rivers Trent and Tame, and it contains hundreds of memorials to the Armed Forces and all manner of other organisations.  Its success has led to calls for the reopening of Alrewas railway station, which lies on a line between Lichfield and Burton which has no regular passenger service.

The local authority here is Lichfield council, which the Conservatives lost control of at the 2023 election: the Tories, who now run the council as a minority, won 23 seats against 17 Labour and 7 Lib Dem councillors.  (Three Conservative councillors have since quit the party group to become independents.)  Alrewas and Fradley, which had previously been a safe Conservative ward, turned in a close result with 43% for the Conservatives, 37% for Labour and 19% for the Lib Dems.

The ward is part of the Lichfield parlaimentary seat, which was gaiend by Labour in 2024; Dave Robertson, an NASUWT organiser and former physics and astronomy teacher, defeated the previous Conservative MP Michael Fabricant by 810 votes.  Robertson kept his seat on Lichfield council until the 2025 Staffordshire county elections, when he stood down; the resulting by-election in Curborough ward of Lichfield city was gained by Reform UK.  On the same day Reform UK won the county council seat of Lichfield Rural East, which includes Alrewas, while the Conservatives narrowly clung on to the Lichfield Rural North division which includes Fradley.

This time it's the Conservatives' turn to defend following the resignation of Mike Wilcox, who had been the leader of Lichfield council from 2010 to 2019.  Wilcox quit the Conservative party last December citing health reasons; in May he didn't seek re-election to Staffordshire county council where he had represented Burntwood South, and then in June he resigned from Lichfield council for personal reasons.  His wife Sonia is still a Conservative councillor for this ward.

Defending this seat for the Conservatives is Richard Stephenson, an Alrewas parish councillor who has recently retired as a veterinary surgeon and now lectures in that subject at Nottingham University.  Stephenson has previously stood for both Lichfield council and the county council without success.  Labour's Glen Bown is a retired teacher, property landlord and Fradley parish councillor.  The Lib Dems' Morag Maclean, who is a former nurse and NHS maanger, is straight back on the campaign travel after standing in Lichfield Rural North in May's county elections.  Completing the ballot paper is Reform UK's Brandon Clark, who graduated earlier this month with a first-class degree in politics from Birmingham University and will be hoping to put that learning straight into action here.

<h2>Barleythorpe</h2>

Rutland council; caused by the resignation of Green Party councillor Hans Zollinger-Ball.

We finish for the week in England's "smallest" "county", a phrase which this column always puts in scare quotes.  This is because it's difficult to construct a definition of "county" which applies to Rutland but which would not apply to the ancient City of London, which has a smaller population and a far smaller acreage than Rutland.  The fact that the council website states "Welcome to Rutland Coutny Council" is not conclusive: Rutland is set up under local government law as a county, but one which does not have a county council.  The local authority instead has the status of a district council, and the use of the title "Rutland County Council" is the result of some creative renaming.

Rutland County Council District Council is England's third-smallest local authority by population after the Isles of Scilly and the City of London, and it is the smallest council in England to have partisan politics.  Until a few years ago Rutland was run by the Conservatives, but their ruling group fell apart in the 2019-23 term; the 2023 election then returned a hung council with 11 Liberal Democrats, 7 independents, 6 Conservatives, 2 Labour and a Green Party councillor.  The Lib Dems and the Green councillor then formed a minority administration.

The Green win came in Barleythorpe, a village just to the north-west of Oakham which has been the subject of massive population growth in recent years.  In 2011 Rutland council gave planning permission for the Oakham North development, with 1,000 houses planned to be built within Barleythorpe parish.  At the time Barleythorpe parish had a population of just 207 people; ten years later, the 2021 census found 2,927 residents of what had by now become the Barleythorpe ward of Rutland council.  The newness of this development means that Barleythorpe comses.

The parliamentary seat covering Rutland has continuously returned Conservative MPs for well over a century, and that record was maintained in 2024 when Alicia Kearns was re-elected for her second term as MP for the redrawn seat of Rutland and Stamford; Kearns is now on the Conservative frontbench as a shadow minister for home affairs.

The massive population growth here in Barleythorpe means that previous local election results here may not be quite as relevant as normal, but for the record Barleythorpe ward returned two independent councillors at its first contest in 2019.  They both retired in 2023, and they were replaced by another independent, Tracy Carr, on 47% of the vote and by Rutland's only Green councillor Hans Zollinger-Ball on 36%, with the Conservatives being the only other party to stand.

Zollinger-Ball, who quit Rutland council last month due to family commitments, was the only Green candidate in the 2023 Rutland elections.  The previous Rutland council had had a different Green councillor, who won a 2022 by-election in Ryhall and Casterton ward off the back of campaigning against a proposed solar farm in that ward.  If the Green vote in Rutland is indeed based on nimbyism, then it's rather hilarious that the party should have won a seat in Barleythorpe of all places.

There is no defending Green Party candidate in this by-election.  We have a free-for-all, I repeat we have a free-for-all!  To take the four candidates in alphabetical order, at the top of the ballot is Barleythorpe parish councillor Andy Burton who is standing as an independent candidate.  Burton, who works as an agronomist, was the losing Conservative candidate for this ward in 2019; before then, he was a long-serving Conservative member of East Riding council in Yorkshire, representing Wolds Weighton ward from 1999 to 2019.  The official Conservative candidate is Andrew Dinsmore, who appeared in this column just three weeks ago when Andrew's Previews covered the by-election for his previous council seat in Hammersmith and Fulham; Dinsmore, who is a barrister specialising in international commercial litigation and arbitration, had represented Fulham Town ward on that council from 2022 to 2025 and he was the Conservative candidate for Hammersmith and Chiswick at the last general election.  Reform UK's Declan McCarthy is a former headteacher and Ofsted inspector who now works as an education consultant.  Last on the ballot paper is the Liberal Democrat candidate Jonathan Nichols, an academic at Leicseter University who studies planetary auroras.
