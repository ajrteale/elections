Nine by-elections on 9th December 2025:
</p><p>
<h2>Seaton</h2>
</p><p>
<em>East Devon council; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Derek Haggerty.</em>
</p><p>
This is a busy week for by-elections, as political campaigners try to beat the Christmas rush.  We have nine polls to bring you with the Conservatives defending four seats, Labour two and the other three split evenly between an independent, Plaid Cymru and the Scottish National Party.  We'll start with one of the Conservative defences.
</p><p>
Last week this column was in Devon, covering a by-election in the Exmouth Halsdon ward of East Devon district.  I indicated then that Exmouth Halsdon was going to be the second part of a two-part series, as the East Devon returning officer had two by-elections to run in consecutive weeks.
</p><p>
So now let's move along the coast to Seaton, which you will not be surprised to hear is located next to the sea.  This was an old port located at the mouth of the River Axe, but the estuary here is now mostly saltmarsh.  Instead Seaton developed as a holiday resort, aided by the coming of the railway in 1868, and tourism is still a major draw here.  Most of the old railway alignment has been taken over by the Seaton Tramway, which links the town with Colyton to the north; the tramway has also recently taken over and reopened the Jurassic Discovery centre, which plays on Seaton's location on the World Heritage Site of the Jurassic Coast.
</p><p>
The local population is nearly as ancient as the Jurassic rocks the town is built on.  In the 2021 census Seaton made the top 25 wards in England and Wales for residents aged 85 or over (8.0%) and the top 40 wards for the 65 to 84 age bracket (35.3%).  Seaton is in the top 30 wards in England and Wales for adults who are retired (47.3%).  And 25.4% of residents identify only as English, which is the highest figure for any ward in south-west England.
</p><p>
The latter statistic generally has a strong correlation with support for Reform UK, but this didn't translate into a Reform UK win here in May's Devon county elections.  Instead Seaton and Colyton division was gained by the Liberal Democrats from the Conservatives in May, continuing a recent trend of Lib Dem succes here at the eastern end of Devon.  The Lib Dems run Devon county council as a minority and they lead the ruling coalition in East Devon district, which also includes independent and Green Party councillors.
</p><p>
At Parliamentary level, until recently Seaton had the UK's longest unbroken streak of Conservative representation.  It elected only Conservative MPs at every opportunity from 1835 until 2022, when Neil Parish resigned after being caught viewing pornography within the Palace of Westminster.  In one of those statements which are so bizarre that they must be true because nobody could possibly make this up and be believed, Parish claimed he had initially been looking at a website about tractors.  The mind boggles.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www2.b3ta.com/host/creative/98688/1651480511/tractormag.jpg" />
</p><p>
The resulting by-election for Parish's seat of Tiverton and Honiton was lost to the Liberal Democrats in June 2022.  The new Lib Dem MP Richard Foord was then challenged in the 2024 general election by Simon Jupp, the outgoing Conservative MP for East Devon.  The Boundary Commission had substantially redrawn both of their seats, but the new constituency of Honiton and Sidmouth was more clearly the successor to Foord's seat than Jupp's.  An MP versus MP battle saw Foord come out on top, and to add insult to Jupp's injury the Conservatives held the redrawn Exmouth and Exeter East seat which he had left behind.
</p><p>
The Lib Dems are, however, yet to crack Seaton ward.  The current ward boundaries date from 2019, and at that year's election the ward returned two councillors from the now-defunct Independent East Devon Alliance and one from the Conservatives.  In 2023 IEDA councillor Dan Ledger was re-elected at the top of the poll with 37% of the vote, the Conservatives' Marcus Hartnell was re-elected at the top of the his party's slate on 30%, and the final seat went to the Conservatives' Derek Haggerty who gained the seat previously held by a retiring IEDA councillor.  The Lib Dems, on 20%, were runners-up.  No party had fielded a full slate of three candidates.
</p><p>
The Conservatives are now defending this by-election after Derek Haggerty handed in his notice in October, slightly more than halfway through his first term of office.   Their defending candidate is Karen Boyes, who works as a barrister.  Paul Johns, who works for Seaton town council, is standing as an independent candidate.  The Lib Dems' Steve Hunt is back for another go after finishing as runner-up here in 2023; he is a retired welding company managing director, and he also claims to be a former district councillor although I've not managed to trace that.  Simon Day, who runs a plumbing and heating firm, completes the ballot paper as the Reform UK candidate.  All four candidates give addresses in Seaton.

<h2>Penyrheol</h2>
</p><p>
<em>Caerphilly council, Gwent; caused by the resignation of Plaid Cymru councillor Lindsay Whittle.</em>
</p><p>
This is going to be one of those weeks where Andrew's Previews has a lot of repeats.  In fact, one of the nine wards up for election today six have been fully previewed in this column before, one has had a predecessor ward appear in this column, and two have been covered in Previews for by-elections to the House of Commons or Senedd Cymru.  Only one of today's wards - Belmont ward, in South Kesteven - is entirely new to your columnist.
</p><p>
Those who were paying attention will note that the numbers in the previous paragraph add up to ten rather than nine as claimed, and that's because Penyrheol ward in Caerphilly was counted twice.  Penyrheol previously featured in this column in August 2013 for readers with very long memories, while today's by-election is a direct consequence of Plaid Cymru's gain of the Senedd Cymru Caerphilly constituency in October.  Welsh local government law has rules against "double-hatting" which are designed to stop politicians holding more than one elective office at once, and this now applies to Lindsay Whittle as the newest member of the Welsh Parliament.  In accordance with the rules he has resigned his previous seat on Caerphilly council, where he was leader of the opposition Plaid Cymru group.
</p><p>
Whittle, who won the Caerphilly constituency in October at his fourteenth attempt, was a very long-standing Plaid Cymru councillor who had sat on Caerphilly council and the predecessor Rhymney Valley council continuously since 1976.  He had twice served as leader of Caerphilly council, and before the double-hatting rules came in he was a member of the old Welsh Assembly from 2011 to 2016, representing the South Wales East region.
</p><p>
The effect of this is that the voters of Penyrheol ward are being called to the polls for the second time in three months.  This is a large ward covering the western side of Caerphilly town around the Aber valley: Penyrheol itself and Energlyn lie to the north of the river, Trecenydd and Hendredenny to the south of it.  The Welsh words <em>pen yr heol</em> can be translated as "end of the road", but that description is a bit unfair on Penyrheol which is generally comfortable enough suburbia.  The eastern boundary of the ward is the Rhymney railway line, on which Energlyn and Churchill Park railway station opened in 2013 to link the area to Cardiff city centre; this line is currently being electrified as part of the Welsh Government's South Wales Metro project.
</p><p>
The presence and personal vote of Lindsay Whittle has kept Penyrheol in the Plaid Cymru column throughout this century, but Labour have often not been that far behind and they did win one of the four available seats in 2012.  However, in 2022 Plaid Cymru held all four seats in Penyrheol ward with a 54-32 lead over Labour.  The Plaid Cymru slate were in fact guaranteed two seats before a vote was cast, due to not enough opposition candidates standing.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2022/caerphilly22s.svgz" alt="Caerffili, 2022" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
This puts Penyrheol ward in the minority on Caerphilly council, which is Labour-controlled.  Labour also still hold the Caerphilly seat at Westminster, which has different boundaries to the Senedd seat: the 2024 boundary changes brought in not just new territory but also a new Labour MP, with Chris Evans transferring here after his previous Islwyn constituency was abolished.
</p><p>
Lindsay Whittle's Caerphilly Senedd constituency, which has different boundaries to the Westminster seat will disappear in five months' time when electoral reform comes to Cardiff Bay.  Whittle has been ranked at number 2 on the prospective Plaid Cymru list, behind the party's deputy leader Delyth Jewell, for the successor seat of Blaenau Gwent Caerffili Rhymni which will return six MSs at the next Welsh Parliament elections in May.  This seat has a notional result from the 2024 Westminster election of 45% and 3 seats for Labour, 18% and 1 seat for Plaid Cymru, 12% and 1 seat for the Conservatives, and 11% and 1 seat for Reform UK; but given his by-election performance Whittle will be confident of getting the extra Plaid Cymru votes he needs for re-election, while these figures are also skewed by the fact that last year Reform UK had no candidate in the Blaenau Gwent and Rhymney half of the electoral area.
</p><p>
May 2026 is still five months away, and before then Plaid have a by-election seat to hold in Penyrheol.  Their defending candidate here is Aneurin Minton who works as a tree surgeon: he is a member of Penyrheol, Trecenydd and Energlyn community council, which has the same boundaries as this ward.  Labour's Keiran Russell is described as a local business leader: he works for a firm which provides co-working space to local entrepreneurs, and he is also involved in the main Welsh esports organisation.  Also on the ballot are the Conservatives' Brandon Gorman who stood here in 2022, Reform UK's James Bevan who works in customer service, and the Lib Dems' Mary Lloyd.

<h2>Armitage and Handsacre</h2>
</p><p>
<em>Lichfield council, Staffordshire; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Nikki Hawkins.</em>
</p><p>
We return to England with the first of two Conservative defences taking place in the Midlands.  Armitage and Handsacre are two large villages located a few miles to the east of Rugeley, on the West Coast Main Line and the Trent and Mersey Canal.
</p><p>
The ward named after those villages extends east to take in the village of Kings Bromley, on the main road going north from Lichfield; and it also runs west to take in some new developments on the edge of Rugeley.  This includes part of the site of the former Rugeley B power station, which closed in 2016 and which is now being redeveloped.  For your columnist Rugeley's cooling towers - which were demolished in 2021 - were always a landmark on a train journey to London, signalling in my mind the transition point from North to South: the River Trent, which is the northern boundary of this ward and flows past the power station site, is sometimes cited as the dividing line between Northern England and Southern England.
</p><p>
With the power station gone, the main employer in this ward is now Armitage Shanks, the company which puts its signature on urinals and has made rather more money out of doing that than Marcel Duchamp ever did.  Armitage Shanks has been making bathroom fixtures and plumbing supplies in Armitage since 1817.  There is also some building going on at the southern end of the ward, where a new Handsacre Junction is under construction: in due course this will mark the northern end of High Speed 2, the point where high-speed trains will be dumped onto the already-overloaded West Coast Main Line.
</p><p>
The route of High Speed 2 has often been a reliable indicator of poor Conservative by-election performances in the past, but this trend was bucked in December 2021 when the Conservatives had little trouble in holding a previous Lichfield council by-election here.  The winning Conservative margin on that occasion was 60-40 in a straight fight with Labour.  Lichfield council was last up for election in 2023, when the Conservative slate defeated Labour in Armitage and Handsacre by the similar margin of 53-33.  This was in an election where the Conservatives lost control of Lichfield council, although they are still running the show as a minority.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2023/lichfield23s.svgz" alt="Lichfield, 2023" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
The Lichfield parliamentary seat was recreated in 1997 and voted Conservative on that occasion against the Labour landslide, but it fell to Labour in 2024.  Dave Robertson, who defeated the flamboyant Conservative MP Michael Fabricant by 810 votes, had previously worked as a physics and astronomy teacher before becoming an NASUWT union organiser.
</p><p>
Armitage and Handsacre probably still voted Conservative in 2024, but in May 2025 this corner of central England changed its allegiance.  This ward is part of the Lichfield Rural West division of Staffordshire county council, which was a narrow gain for Reform UK from the Conservatives this year.
</p><p>
So we have a rather difficult political context here now compared to the last Armitage and Handsacre by-election in December 2021.  This poll is to replace Conservative councillor Nikki Hawkins, who was first elected in 2023.  She has stood down from Lichfield council, and also as a JP, to care for a family member.
</p><p>
Defending this seat for the Conservatives is Martin Punyer, a local resident who has recently retired from a career in political consultancy: Punyer was a Conservative election agent for many years, and he was a regional director of the Vote Leave campaign in the 2016 referendum.  The Labour candidate James Blackman sits on the parish-level Lichfield city council and runs a firm providing software for the logistics industry.  Morag Maclean stands for the Lib Dems, Reform UK's Andrew Clissett is looking to double up at district and county level after being elected in May as the Staffordshire county councillor for Burntwood North, and the Green Party have selected David Cullen.

<h2>Aveland; and<br>
Belmont</h2>
</p><p>
<em>South Kesteven council, Lincolnshire; caused respectively by the resignations of Conservative councillor Richard Dixon-Warren and independent councillor Phil Gadd.</em>
</p><p>
We now travel east to cover two polls in southern Lincolnshire, including the week's only area which is completely new to this column.  This is the Belmont ward of South Kesteven, which covers the high ground immediately to the east of the town of Grantham.  Its eastern boundary is the High Dyke, which was once part of the Roman Ermine Street and is now a B-road running north from Colsterworth.
</p><p>
The name Belmont refers to a primary school in the ward which is its main polling station.  The ward boundaries are based on the parish of Londonthorpe and Harrowby Without, but don't let the order of this name fool you: Londonthorpe is a tiny hamlet.  The ward's electorate is instead dominated by the Harrowby Without section, which consists of housing development which is to all intents and purposes part of Grantham but which has spilled over the town boundary.
</p><p>
The northern end of Belmont ward takes in a large chunk of Belton Park, which is now in the hands of the National Trust.  This was the grounds of Belton House, a Carolean pile which has been claimed to be the inspiration for the icon used for stately homes on road signs.  The house itself lies outside the ward boundary.  The Lords Brownlow, who owned Belton House until 1984, gave over much of the park to defence purposes in the two world wars: in the First World War there was a training centre here for the Machine Gun Corps complete with its own railway link to the East Coast Main Line, while in 1942 RAF Belton Park was established as the depot of the RAF Regiment.  This depot closed in 1946 and its site is now covered by the Alma Park industrial estate.
</p><p>
RAF Belton Park was never an airfield, but the Air Force also had planes in this ward at RAF Spitalgate which was located next to the A52 road climbing east from Grantham town centre.  Spitalgate airfield was originally opened in 1915 by the Royal Flying Corps and was used for flying training during the First World War and in the interwar years; during the Cold War it became an officer cadet training unit and then served as the depot for the Women's Royal Air Force.  The RAF moved out of here in 1975 and the site then was taken over by the Army, who renamed it as Prince William of Gloucester Barracks after a grandson of George V who had been killed in a plane crash.  To the south of the barracks is a linear building site: a new southern bypass of Grantham is under construction, and most of its route will be located in Belmont ward.
</p><p>
The name of the High Dyke Roman road refers to its location on a ridge of high ground.  To the east of here the hills flatten out and the landscape changes to fenland.  Here we find the Aveland ward, which covers six parishes on the main road north of Bourne towards Sleaford.  None of these are called Aveland: the name refers to a former Wapentake of the Parts of Kesteven, which met at Aslackby within this ward.  The largest centre of population here is Rippingale, with 694 electors on the roll according to the notice of poll.
</p><p>
Both of these wards lie within the Grantham and Bourne parliamentary seat, which was contested for the first time in 2024.  It fairly easily re-elected Conservative MP Gareth Davies, who had represented the main predecessor seat of Grantham and Stamford since 2019.  Davies had been a Treasury minister going into the 2024 general election, and he continues to be part of the Conservatives' frontbench Treasury team.
</p><p>
South Kesteven council is a rather different matter.  The Conservatives lost control of this council in 2023 when they won 24 seats against 22 independents, 4 Greens, 4 Lib Dems and 2 Labour; a rainbow anti-Conservative coalition then took control which includes the two largest independent groups and has an independent leader.  In the last six months four Conservative councillors have defected to Reform UK, but one of them didn't last a month in their new party before subsequently walking out on them and going independent.
</p><p>
Belmont ward had been in the Conservative column until 2023, when its two seats were gained by an independent slate: vote shares on that occasion were 49% for independents, 32% for the Conservatives and 19% for Labour.  All 946 people who voted in that poll got it right, with not a single ballot paper being recorded as spoiled.  Top of the poll was Phil Gadd, who joined the Grantham Independents group on the council: this is one of the two independent groups within the ruling coalition.  Gadd submitted his resignation at the end of October. (Phil Gadd is not to be confused with Gary Glitter, who is Paul Gadd.)
</p><p>
The smaller (by headcount) Aveland ward was previously previewed in this column in March 2014 and February 2022.  The latter by-election was to replace Conservative councillor Peter Moseley, who had been returned unopposed in 2019 and had just won the 2021 Green Flag award for Councillor of the Year in honour of his contribution to South Kesteven's parks and green spaces.  Moseley's resignation followed a social media row over COVID restrictions and vaccine mandates: this might not have merited a by-election on its own, but comparing the then Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau to Hitler did cross a line for the Conservative group, which suspended Moseley before he quit the council.  The 2022 by-election easily returned the Conservatives' Richard Dixon-Warren, who I described then as an Army veteran of 40 years' service; Dixon-Warren was then re-elected in 2023 with a 59-27 lead over the Liberal Democrats.  His resignation statement indicated that he wanted to spend more time with his family and on his work with charities and local organisations.
</p><p>
Aveland ward is sufficiently true-blue that the Conservatives were able to hold Folkingham Rural, the local county council division, in the 2025 Lincolnshire county council elections.  Belmont ward forms half of the Grantham East county division, which was a Reform UK gain from the Conservatives in May.
</p><p>
The defending Conservative candidate for Aveland ward is Tony Vaughan, who previously appeared in this column when he lost a December 2022 by-election in Toller ward to the north.  Vaughan has since has a number of unsuccessful election campaigns, most recently in Deepings East at May's county elections.  Second here in 2023 were the Lib Dems, who haven't stood a candidate this time: instead Vaughan's opposition will come from Reform UK's Kyle Abel (who stood in Grantham West in May), Labour's David Burling and the Green Party's Brynley Heaven.
</p><p>
In Belmont ward one new independent candidate has come forward to replace Phil Gadd: Declan Gibbons is a Grantham town councillor who is nominated by the ward's remaining independent councillor Elvis Stooke.  Uh-huh.  Stooke is also part of the Grantham Independents group on the council, so we might expect Gibbons to join their ranks if he wins.  The Conservatives' Adam Stokes, who works as an accountant, is a former deputy leader of South Kesteven council who lost his seat to Labour in Grantham Springfield ward in 2023; Stokes then lost his Lincolnshire county council seat in Grantham South to Reform UK in May.  Labour have selected Susan Nash, who appears to be standing for election for the first time.  And two parties which didn't stand here in 2023 are having a go this time: Sean Hothersall is the Green Party candidate, and Richard Litchfield - the newly-elected county councillor for Grantham Barrowby division - is standing for Reform UK.

<h2>Eaglescliffe West</h2>
</p><p>
<em>Stockton-on-Tees council, County Durham; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Laura Tunney.</em>
</p><p>
We now come to two by-elections for wards located close to each other in the Tees Valley mayoral area, one on the western edge of the Teesside conurbation and the other on the eastern edge of Darlington.  The former of these wards is based on the parish of Egglescliffe, which lies on the Durham bank of the Tees opposite the town of Yarm on the Yorkshire bank.  The name Eaglescliffe, which originally referred to a railway junction at the eastern end of this ward, appears to have originated as a misspelling of Egglescliffe.
</p><p>
Eaglescliffe and Allens West railway stations serve this ward.  Both of these stations lie on the Stockton and Darlington railway, which opened for business in 1825 and was the first public railway to use steam locomotives.  In consequence of this, the railway industry has been celebrating 2025 as the 200th anniversary of the birth of the modern railway.
</p><p>
But the history of Allens West railway station shows that the railways have not historically been the major employer here.  This station has been in the public timetable since the 1970s, but it actually opened during the Second World War as an unadvertised halt, to serve a large Ministry of Defence base which evolved into a supply depot for the Royal Navy.  Eaglescliffe Depot closed in 1997; some of the old MoD base is now a nature reserve called the Admiralty Ecology Site, while the rest is being redeveloped.
</p><p>
Eaglescliffe West ward also takes in four other parishes to the west of Stockton, although the only other settlement here of any size is Long Newton on the main A66 road between Teesside and Darlington.  The ward also takes in the north-eastern end of the runway at Teesside Airport, which is mostly located within Darlington borough.  This airport was taken over by the Tees Valley combined authority in 2019, at which point its name was changed back from "Durham Tees Valley"; it handled around 228,000 passengers in 2023-24, with its busiest route being to Amsterdam.
</p><p>
Until 2023 the Long Newton area was part of the Western Parishes ward of Stockton-on-Tees, which saw a rather unusual by-election in May 2021.  The ward's Conservative councillor Andrew Stephenson, who had fallen off the council during the COVID pandemic under the six-month non-attendance rule, sought re-election in the resulting by-election as an independent candidate and polled poorly.  Stephenson then fought the new Eaglescliffe West ward in 2023 on the Reform UK ticket, and he finished in sixth and last place with 6%.
</p><p>
Eaglescliffe West is a safe Conservative ward like its predecessors, and the Tory lead here in 2023 was 57-29 over Labour.  The old Eaglescliffe ward had Liberal Democrat councillors up until 2015, but the local Lib Dem branch now appear to have given up here and they are not on the ballot paper for this by-election.  This is one key difference between the politics of Eaglescliffe and Nunthorpe ward in Middlesbrough, which we visited last week: Nunthorpe is demographically similar in nature as a middle-class ward, but it has a Lib Dem presence in its local politics which Eaglescliffe West now lacks.
</p><p>
Stockton-on-Tees was actually a bright spot for the Conservatives in the 2023 local elections, as the party gained seats overall to finish on 26 seats out of a possible 56 and become the largest party on the council.  But this wasn't enough for a majority, and Labour remain in minority control of the borough with the support of localist parties for Thornaby and Ingleby Barwick.
</p><p>
Boundary changes for the 2024 election placed Eaglescliffe West within the Stockton West parliamentary seat, which is the only remaining Conservative seat in the North East region.  The MP Matt Vickers benefited from very favourable boundary changes, and he would almost certainly have lost re-election if his old seat of Stockton South had still existed.  Vickers is now on the frontbench as a shadow Home Office minister.
</p><p>
Shortly after Vickers' re-election the Conservatives easily held a double by-election to Stockton council in Fairfield ward.  The party will now be looking to make it three defences out of three in this poll to replace Laura Tunney, who stood down in November after ten years in office.  Tunney was first elected for the former Eaglescliffe ward in 2015, gaining her seat from the Lib Dems.
</p><p>
Defending this seat for the Conservatives is Stephen Dodds, who is an architect.  Labour have clearly decided that they'd better call Saul, because their candidate is Frank Saul.  Also on the ballot are the Greens' Danny Reed and Reform UK's Rick Macdonald, who stood without success in an extraordinary election for all eleven seats on Yarm town council in August.

<h2>Red Hall and Lingfield</h2>
</p><p>
<em>Darlington council, County Durham; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Amanda Riley.</em>
</p><p>
Our other Tees Valley ward up for election today is only a few miles to the west of Eaglescliffe West, but it's a very different area.  Red Hall and Lingfield is a working-class ward on the eastern edge of the town of Darlington.  It is dominated in every sense by a large industrial estate, which currently includes the head office and main factory for Magnet Kitchens, the English office of the Student Loans Company and a large call centre for the mobile phone company EE among others.  And that's only counting what's within the ward boundary: just outside the line we find a Cummins engine factory and the now-defunct site once occupied by the engineering firm Cleveland Bridge.  The old Cleveland Bridge site has recently been taken over by a firm called Endolys, which has plans to build a plant there to recycle plastic film waste.  Housing here comes in the form of the deprived Red Hall estate located to the north of the factories, together with residential areas in Lingfield at the western end of the ward.
</p><p>
Red Hall and Lingfield ward regularly returns the Labour slate in ordinary Darlington council elections, but by-elections are another matter - and this ward seems to generate quite a lot of them.  Andrew's Previews last gave this ward the full treatment in November 2017, when the defending Labour candidate was a teenager with a Muslim name and the Tories put up a candidate who had been fined earlier in the year by Newton Aycliffe magistrates for being drunk and disorderly and obstructing a police officer.  In an impressive display of brass neck, that Conservative candidate tried to turn this conviction to his advantage by claiming, in the words of the <em>Mirror</em>, that 'the fracas meant he was a candidate who "represents reality" and has "life experience"'.  He lost by 19 votes.  The Tories made no mistake in a subsequent by-election in May 2021, winning easily on the undercard of Ben Houchen's first re-election as mayor of the Tees Valley.
</p><p>
Labour recovered their by-election loss in 2023, defeating the Conservative slate in Red Hall and Lingfield by 54-40.  Results elsewhere in the borough meant that Darlington council remained hung, with Labour winning 24 seats, the Conservatives 15 and the Green Party (7), the Lib Dems (3) and an independent holding the balance of power.  Labour formed a coalition with the Liberal Democrats to take control.
</p><p>
The most recent poll here was for the general election in July 2024.  The Darlington constituency is smaller and more Labour-inclined than the borough, and it has proven to be a Labour-inclined marginal over the years with often low swings.  In 2024 Darlington was a Labour gain for Lola McEvoy, who had been a GMB union organiser before her election.
</p><p>
Red Hall and Lingfield is now having its third by-election in eight years to replace Amanda Riley, who was first elected in 2023 and stood down in October on health grounds.  Defending this seat for Labour is local resident Jonnie Vasey, who is one of the many Darlington residents working on the EE campus; he was an unsuccessful candidate for other wards in the 2019 and 2023 Darlington elections.  The Conservative candidate is Kyle Bartch, who also gives an address in the ward: he previously stood here in 2019 and has since been successfully treated for a brain tumour.  Also on the ballot are the Greens' Louise Maddison, independent candidate Monty Brack who has previously sought election on the tickets of UKIP and the For Britain Movement and stood in last year's general election as an Independents for Direct Democracy candidate for Stockton West, the Lib Dems' Simon Thorley who was their candidate for Tees Valley mayor in 2024 and is apparently having a go at this seat based on opposition to the plastic film recycling plant proposal, and Reform UK's Michael Walker who works as a teacher and was their parliamentary candidate for Darlington last year.

<h2>Whitburn and Blackburn</h2>
</p><p>
<em>West Lothian council, Scotland; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor David Russell.</em>
</p><p>
Our remaining two by-elections this week are both in Scottish wards which this column visited last year, one in the Highlands and the other in the Lowlands.  We'll start with the Lowlands poll, which is in one of the more sparsely-populated areas of the Central Belt.
</p><p>
The towns of Whitburn and Blackburn both lie off the M8 motorway, between Edinburgh and Glasgow, and they both boomed in population during the 1960s as a result of Glasgow overspill.  They were both once coalmining centres, while Blackburn also had a British Leyland plant and the Levi's factory in Whitburn turned out up to four million pairs of jeans each year.  All of this has gone now, but some other industrial parks have sprung up next to the motorway and both towns are within commuting distance of both Edinburgh and Glasgow.  In music, Blackburn was the home town of Susan Boyle while the Whitburn Band is one of Scotland's premier brass bands, with 23 Scottish Championship wins under their belt to date.  And they can still have some fun, as this Laurel and Hardy-themed video shows.
</p><p>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjMWwYc9_As
</p><p>
The words "another fine mess" often come to mind in examining Whitburn and Blackburn ward's previous election results, which are usually close affairs.  In 2007 Labour won two seats here, and the SNP had enough votes to win the other two but ended up losing their second seat to "Action to Save St John's Hospital", a now-defunct group which won three seats on West Lothian council that year.  Here, the hospital campaigners benefited from the SNP failing to balance their candidates and from friendly transfers from the Conservatives in the last count to defeat the second SNP candidate by 116 votes.  St John's Hospital in Livingston was, and still is, the main general hospital for West Lothian.
</p><p>
Action to Save St John's Hospital lost all their seats in 2012, with the SNP making the gain here.  In 2017 the Conservatives polled enough votes to win a seat, and this should have come from Labour; but again the SNP screwed up by ambitiously going for three seats.  If the SNP had stood only two candidates then they would have won two seats; but when the third SNP candidate was eliminated enough votes leaked out of the SNP ticket to hand the final seat to Labour's Kirsteen Sullivan by 80 votes.
</p><p>
The 2022 result in Whitburn and Blackburn was even closer.  On first preferences the SNP polled 39%, Labour 37% and the Conservatives 18%.  The SNP's Jim Dickson and Labour's George Paul were both elected with over the required 20% on the first count, setting up a three-way race for the final two seats between the second SNP candidate Mary Dickson, the second Labour candidate Kirsteen Sullivan and the outgoing Conservative councillor Bruce Fairbairn.  At the penultimate stage Fairbairn was on 1,175 votes, Sullivan on 1,121 and Dickson on 1,095; but the final count saw the redistribution of 231 votes from the Scottish Green candidate, and once those votes were transferred the SNP's Mary Dickson won the third seat with 1,195 votes, Kirsteen Sullivan won the final seat with 1,189 votes and Bruce Fairbairn, despite starting with 92% of the required quota, finished on 1,187 votes and lost his seat.  If we rerun the 2022 count for a single seat, then the result would be more decisive - a 53-47 lead for Labour over the SNP.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2022/w-lothian22s.svgz" alt="W Lothian, 2022" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
This gain helped the Scottish National Party to consolidate their position as the largest party on West Lothian council, with the 2022 elections returning 15 SNP councillors, 12 Labour, 4 Conservatives, 1 independent and 1 Lib Dem.  The independent councillor died last year and Labour gained the resulting by-election in the neighbouring Armadale and Blackridge ward.
</p><p>
Overall there is a Unionist majority on the council, and Labour run a minority administration in which Kirsteen Sullivan was depute leader - until she was elected in July 2024 as the Labour MP for Bathgate and Linlithgow, the constituency which includes this ward.  Her majority on that occasion was rather more comfortable than the 2-vote lead she squeaked in by in 2022.
</p><p>
Sullivan had also contested the 2021 Holyrood election as the Labour candidate for Linlithgow, which covers most of this ward and has been represented since 2011 by the SNP's Fiona Hyslop.  A corner of Whitburn and Blackburn ward is included in the Almond Valley Scottish Parliament constituency, whose MSP Angela Constance is the Scottish cabinet secretary for justice and home affairs together with being chairman and business convenor of the Scottish National Party.
</p><p>
Kirsteen Sullivan resigned from West Lothian council following her election to Westminster, and her seat was held for Labour by David Russell at the resulting by-election last November.  First preference vote shares were 31% for Labour, 29% for the SNP, 16% for Reform UK and 12% for an independent candidate, with Labour prevailing after transfers by 53-47 over the SNP - exactly the same final margin as the notional result from 2022.
</p><p>
The voters of Whitburn and Blackburn are now being called out for the second by-election of this term because the first by-election winner David Russell tendered his resignation from West Lothian council in September, after ten months in office.  He has also reportedly quit the Labour Party.
</p><p>
This time the defending Labour candidate is Samuel McCulloch.  The Scottish National Party have selected Callum Cox, who is a high-energy physicist.  Several of the losing candidates from last year's by-election are having another go including Reform UK's David McLennan, who has contested three of the four previous West Lothian by-elections in this term and finished in third place in all three of them.  Also trying again is independent candidate Thomas Lynch, who is the chair of Whitburn community council and finished in a respectable fourth place last year.  The ballot paper is completed by Reece Sinnott for the Conservatives, Douglas Butler for the Lib Dems, Robbie Walker for the Greens and independent candidate Eddie Millar, who previously stood in Livingston South ward in 2022 and a 2021 by-election; Millar had originally been selected as the Conservative candidate for that by-election, but the party then dropped him for tasteless social media posts.

<h2>Fort William and Ardnamurchan</h2>
</p><p>
<em>Highland council, Scotland; caused by the resignation of Scottish National Party councillor Sarah Fanet.</em>
</p><p>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtbS_PdA198
</p><p>
Yet again, it's time for the voters of Corrour (if there are any people who live here year-round) to make a healthy, informed, democratic decision
 -- hopefully one not involving heroin.
Home to the UK's highest and possibly most remote mainline railway station,
Corrour is part of the Fort William and Ardnamurchan ward of Highland council which sprawls across a thousand square miles of the Scottish Highlands.  To put this into some sort of context, 1,000 square miles is almost exactly equal to one Luxembourg.  This large area is very sparsely populated, with 8,902 electors on the roll.
</p><p>
<img alt="Highland, Ft William/Ardnamurchan" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/highland-ft-william-ardnamurchan.webp">
</p><p>
Around a third of those people live in Fort William, at the head of Loch Linnhe.  Fort William is the major settlement in the western Highlands and, together with its suburbs of Caol and Corpach which are not part of this ward, it has a larger population than anywhere in the Highland council area except Inverness.  The town itself dates from the seventeenth century, having originally been a military fort built by Cromwell's army.  It has had a number of names over the years, with the current name commemorating the Butcher himself: Prince William, Duke of Cumberland.
</p><p>
Fort William's location at the foot of the UK's highest point, Ben Nevis, makes it a major tourist trap.  But it also has a lot of industry.  For example, the town is home to the UK's only remaining aluminium smelting plant.  Aluminium smelting involves a huge amount of electricity, which the Fort William plant derives sustainably from the Lochaber hydroelectric scheme.
</p><p>
To the south of Fort William lies Ballachulish, where an impressive bridge carries the main road to Glasgow over Loch Leven.  The south side of Loch Leven was once part of Argyll and is known for the valley of Glencoe, which has gone down in infamy as the site of a 1692 massacre of members of the Clan MacDonald by UK government forces.
</p><p>
There's no bridge over Loch Linnhe, so a rickety ferry crossing at Corran or a long detour out of the ward via Glenfinnan are the only way to Ardnamurchan.  Also once part of Argyll, the peninsula of Ardnamurchan leads to Corrachadh Mòr, which at <!--6\textdegree~13$'$--> 6 degrees 13 minutes West is the most westerly point of the British mainland.  Just to the north of Corrachadh Mòr is the lighthouse at Ardnamurchan Point, which gets a namecheck just before 1am every morning in the Shipping Forecast on Radio 4.
</p><p>
"Ardnamurchan" in this ward name refers to the pre-1975 Ardnamurchan district of Argyll, which covered not just the peninsula itself but the whole area south of Glenfinnan and Loch Shiel.  The main population centres here are Acharacle at the foot of Loch Shiel, and Strontian which is the location of the Ardnamurchan High School.  Before the high school was built in 2002, Ardnamurchan's secondary school students had to travel from here to Fort William, to Mallaig, or over the water to Tobermory on Mull.  Strontian was a lead-mining centre from the 18th century, and it has given its name to the chemical element of strontium: this is one of the alkaline earth metals, and it used to be in major demand for making cathode ray tubes for colour TVs.  Cathode ray tubes are out of fashion now, but strontium salts are also popular in the fireworks industry because they burn with a deep red colour.
</p><p>
That's the Fort William and Ardnamurchan ward, whose boundaries have been unchanged since PR came in for Scottish local elections in 2007.  The main benefit of PR in places like the Highlands was to ensure contested elections, and we certainly had that in 2007 when eleven candidates stood for the four seats in this ward.  The seats went to the Lib Dems, an independent (Donald Cameron), the SNP and Labour, with Labour having a 55-vote majority over independent Patricia Jordon in the final count.  Jordon had done well to get that far, having started in eighth place and overtaken two other independents and the Conservative candidate.
</p><p>
That Conservative candidate was Andrew Baxter, who subsequently stood in the 2012 election as an independent and topped the poll.  He repeated the trick again at the last Highland elections in May 2017, being elected on the first count with 37% of the first preferences.  The SNP polled 33% and won two seats, while the Conservatives' Ian Ramon polled 13% and won a seat here for the first time.  At the decisive count the second SNP candidate Niall McLean finished 120 votes ahead of Labour, with a Conservative surplus of 9 still to distribute.  Ian Ramon died in 2021, and the resulting first Fort William and Ardnamurchan by-election
<!--\footnote{\emph{Andrew's Previews 2021}, page 552.} -->
was gained from the Conservatives by French-born SNP candidate Sarah Fanet: on first preferences Fanet polled 40% to 21% for the Conservatives, 14% for the Greens and 10% for the Lib Dems, with Fanet going on to defeat the Conservatives by 63-37 in the final count.
</p><p>
Sarah Fanet was the only councillor to seek re-election here in 2022, and while it's understandable that the SNP didn't seek to hold their by-election gain it's slightly surprising that they only stood one candidate, putting two seats up for grabs.  The retirement of independent councillor Andrew Baxter also put a lot of votes up for grabs.  Just five candidates stood for the four available seats, with the Lib Dems' Angus Macdonald topping the poll on 37%, the SNP's Fanet also elected on the first count with 33%, and the Conservatives' Fiona Fawcett starting on 10% in third place.  On those vote shares the Lib Dems and SNP would both have won two seats if they had stood two candidates; instead, their surpluses gave the final two seats to the Greens' Kate Willis who started fourth on 10% and to independent Thomas Maclennan who started fifth with 9%.  Maclennan defeated Fawcett for the final seat by the wide margin of 724 votes to 570.  If we rerun the 2022 count for one seat, then the Lib Dems' Angus Macdonald would have beaten the SNP's Sarah Fanet by 56-44 after transfers.
</p><p>
In Holyrood elections this ward is part of the Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch constituency.  This has been represented since 2016 by the former SNP leadership contender Kate Forbes, who will retire at the next Scottish Parliament election in May.  Forbes currently serves in John Swinney's cabinet as Deputy First Minister, with the economy and Gaelic portfolio.
</p><p>
At Westminster this ward is split between two constituencies.  Ardnamurchan and the five polling districts on or around Loch Leven - Onich, Kinlochleven, Glencoe, Ballachulish and Duror - were transferred last year into the Argyll and Bute constituency, whose name was consequentially changed to Argyll, Bute and South Lochaber.  (As already stated, much of this transferred area was part of Argyll until 1975.)  This was one of the few Scottish seats to stay with the SNP in 2024, re-electing its MP Brendan O'Hara.
</p><p>
Fort William, on the other hand, ended up in the newly-drawn seat of Inverness, Skye and West Ross-shire.  This was the last constituency to declare its result in July 2024, not because the result was particularly close but due to a failure to reconcile the number of votes counted with the number of votes received: this took a full recount, on the Saturday after the election, to resolve.  Once the count was eventually settled the Liberal Democrats' Angus Macdonald, councillor for Fort William and Ardnamurchan, was declared the winner with a lead of 2,160 votes over the outgoing SNP MP for Inverness Drew Hendry.  The previous Lib Dem MP for Fort William had been the late former party leader Charles Kennedy; the Highland council have named their Fort William offices in his honour, and the Charles Kennedy Building is the largest of the sixteen polling stations for this by-election.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2022/highland22s.svgz" alt="Highland, 2022" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Angus Macdonald MP resigned his Highland council seat following his election to Westminster, setting up the second Fort William and Ardnamurchan by-election in November 2024.  For that poll the Liberal Democrats selected Andrew Baxter, who had become Macdonald's chief of staff and had previously represented the ward from 2012 to 2022 as an independent and then Conservative councillor.  Baxter held the 2024 by-election for the Lib Dems in a landslide result, winning on the first count with a 59-26 lead over the SNP.
</p><p>
That result might give the SNP some concern going into this third Fort William and Ardnamurchan by-election, because this time they are the defending party.  Sarah Fanet stood down from the council at the end of October because she is returning to her native France.  Fanet had served since winning the first by-election in December 2021, and she had made a bit of history on her first election as the Highlands' first transgender councillor.
</p><p>
We have a completely fresh ballot paper this time, with none of the losing candidates from the 2024 by-election trying again.  Defending for the SNP is Norrie Maclean, who has been heavily involved with community groups in Fort William for many years.  The Lib Dems' Matthew Prosser, who lives in Kinlochleven, stood as an independent candidate in a by-election for the neighbouring Caol and Mallaig ward in September and polled 1.3%; he will be hoping for better this time on his home turf and under his new colours.  Ollie Crookwood is the candidate of the Scottish Greens, Labour's Michael Perera is a frequent candidate in Highland council by-elections, the Conservatives are hopping that Julie Peill will appeal to the electorate, and after missing the 2024 by-election Reform UK have joined the fray this time with their candidate Allan Macdonald.
