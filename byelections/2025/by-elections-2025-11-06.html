Eight by-elections on 6th November 2025:

<h2>Buckhaven, Methil and Wemyss Villages</h2>

Fife council, Scotland; caused by the disqualification of Labour councillor David Graham.

[INCLUDE COMPOSITION]

We'll start this week north of the border, on the coastal strip between Kirkcaldy to the south and Leven to the north.  This coast is riddled with sea-caves, some of which contain carvings from the Pictish era: the Wemyss (pronounced Weems) villages in the south-west corner of the ward derive their name from the Gaelic word for "cave", <em>uamh</em>.

The main Wemyss villages are East Wemyss, West Wemyss and Coaltown of Wemyss, and the latter name gives us a clue that not all underground spaces in this ward are natural.  We are on the Fife coalfield here, and East Wemyss was a pit village back in the day.  Buckhaven was a thriving fishing village until the coal industry arrived, and in 1831 198 boats were operating out of here giving Buckhaven Scotland's second-largest fishing fleet; but the harbour here silted up in the 19th century and has now disappeared.

Buckhaven's twin town of Methil, meanwhile, was transformed by the coal industry from a small fishing port into an important harbour for the export of Fife coal.  Methil Docks are quieter now than in the interwar years when 3 million tons of coal per year passed through here, but they are still in operation for imports and exports of timber and wood chips.  Next to the docks, and sponsored by a timber firm, is the Bayview Stadium which has been home to East Fife football club since 1998.  In 2018 this was the location where Eric Morecambe's comedy football result East Fife 4 Forfar 5 finally happeed - albiet in a penalty shootout.

Bayview Stadium used to lie in the shadow of Methil power station, which generated electricity by burning coal slurry: the power station was mothballed in 2001 and demolished a decade later.  Methil power station had retained its own freight-only branch line until its closure, and this route has recently been upgraded and reopened to passenger trains as the Levenmouth rail link to serve Leven, Methil and Buckhaven.  Leven and Cameron Bridge railway stations, which opened to passengers in June 2024, are both just outside the boundary of this ward.

The current timetable gives the Levenmouth line two trains every hour to Edinburgh, one running via Kirkcaldy and the other via Glenrothes.  This split neatly reflects how this ward is represented in the two Parliaments, as Buckhaven, Methil and Wemyss Villages lie within the Kirkcaldy constituency at Holyrood and the Glenrothes and Mid Fife constituency at Westminster.  In 2021 the Kirkcaldy Scottish Parliament seat re-elected its SNP MSP David Torrance for a third term, while the seat's Labour candidate Claire Baker was elected to Holyrood as a regional MSP for Mid Scotland and Fife.  Claire's husband Richard Baker is now the Westminster MP for Glenrothes and Mid Fife, having gained that seat from the SNP last year.

The 2022 Fife council elections returned 34 Scottish National Party councillors, 20 Labour, 13 Lib Dems and 8 Conservatives; one councillor each from Labour and the Conservatives has since defected to Reform UK, while a further Conservative councillor is now sitting as an indepndent after joining the Faragists.  There is a Unionist majority on the council, and Labour run a minority administration.

Buckhaven, Methil and Wemyss Villages ward was created in 2007, and since 2017 its representation has been evenly split with two councillors each for the SNP and Labour.  The SNP led here 47-40 on first preferences in 2022; if we rerun the count for a single vacancy then the SNP's Ken Caldwell would have beaten Labour's David Graham by 53-47.

David Graham had represented this ward since 2012, and he topped the poll in that year and in 2017 with the most first preferences of any candidate.  However, his political career has ended in disgrace.  In July Graham was found guilty of sexual offences committed against a teenage girl, and in August he was sent to prison for 27 months and placed on the sex offenders' register for ten years.  Following Graham's sentencing, Fife council announced that he had been disqualified as a councillor.

Trying to pick up the pieces of this for Labour is Donna Donnelly, who is fighting her first election campaign: she is a Unite figure who lives in Methilhill and works at a supermarket in Leven.  Another first-timer is the SNP's Anne Marie Caldwell, who also lives in Methilhill and has a background in education.  Also on the ballot are Brian Mills for the Conservatives who was a very distant runner-up here in 2022, Jill Reilly for the Lib Dems, Christine Watson for Alba, Kieran Anderson for a pro-Scottish independence outfit called Sovereignty, and Mark Davies for Reform UK.

<h2>Balderton North and Coddington; and<br>
Castle</h2>

Newark and Sherwood council, Nottinghamshire; caused respectively by the resignatios of independent councillors Emma Oldham and Adrian Amer.

Four of today's eight local by-elections come in the East Midlands, with two falling in and around the town of Newark-on-Trent.  This was an important town located at the crossing point of the Fosse Way and the Great North Road, which crossed the River Trent here: the Trent has very few fixed bridges, but Newark has one of them.

Perhaps because of this, Newark saw major action in the English Civil War in which it was a Royalist stronghold: the town was besieged three times in the years 1644 to 1646, and only surrendered to the Roundheads when ordered to do so by Charles I.  Newark Castle, which occupies a strategic location next to the Trent Bridge and the Fosse Way, was slighted once the Civil War was over.

The modern Castle ward covers the town centre of Newark, together with a small area of housing along the Farndon Road to the south-west and the part of the old Newark borough which lies west of the Trent.  Here can be found Newark Castle railway station, on the line from Nottingham to Lincoln, and the large British Sugar factory next to the Great North Road which processes sugar beet.

The Great North Road passed through Balderton on its way into Newark town centre from the south, and Newark and Balderton have now merged into a single urban area.  The village of Coddington once lay on the main road east from Newark towards Sleaford, but it is now bypassed: it is cut off from Newark town by the A1 bypass, which opened in 1964 to take Great North Road traffic out of the town centre.

The boundaries of Balderton North and Coddington ward also take in the village of Barnby in the Willows and the Newark Air Museum, which is based at the former RAF Winthorpe airfield.  This opened in 1940 as a base for Polish squadrons serving in the Royal Air Force.  A number of other airfields in the area hosted Poles fighing in the Battle of Britain, and nearly 400 Polish airmen are buried in Newark Cemetery.  Until recently they were joined in eternal rest by three Polish presidents-in-exile and by Władysław Sikorski, who was buried here in 1943 after he was killed in a plane crash in Gibraltar.  Sikorski's remains were translated to Wawel Castle in Kraków in 1993, after the fall of Communism in Poland, and the three presidents were similarly repatriated in 2022.  Last month Newark town council donated Sikorski's gravestone to Poland, where it is now in the collection of the Polish History Museun in Warsaw.

The 1943 Gibraltar crash which killed Sikorski also claimed the lives of two Conservative MPs.  Newark was the last Parliamentary borough to be enfranchised before the Great Reform Act, returning its first MPs in 1673 in recognition of the town's Royalist sympathies during the Civil War, and it has had a long line of Conservative MPs including William Ewart Gladstone, who is now remembered aa a Liberal prime minister but started his career as a Conservative MP for Newark from 1832 to 1845.

Since the Third Redistribution of 1885 the Newark constituency has been a county division of Nottinghamshire, and its last three MPs have been somewhat controversial figures.  In the 1997 Labour landslide the seat fell to Labour candidate Fiona Jones, who lost her seat in the Commons in 1999 after being convicted of overspending on her election campaign but was then reinstated after that conviction was overturned.  Jones was defeated in 2001 by the Conservatives' Patrick Mercer, who resigned in 2014 after being suspended from the Commons in 2014 for breaches of paid advocacy rules.  The resulting by-election was won by Robert Jenrick, who served in the Johnson Cabinet as housing, communities and L******** U* secretary and is now the shadow justice secretary.  Jenrick was re-electd for his fifth term of office in 2024, making Newark one of the few seats which voted Labour in 1997 but not since.

Jenrick clearly has a fairly effective political machine going in his constituency, because Newark and Sherwood delivered one of the better Conservative results in the May 2025 local elections.  Although Reform UK narrowly polled the most votes across the Newark and Sherwood district, the Conservatives beat them in the seat count here by 6-4.  Included in the Conservative total are the Farndon and Trent county division which covers Castle ward, and three of the four county divisions which contain part of Balderton North and Coddington ward (the exception is Newark West, which covers a very small corner of that ward).

Mind, even the Jenrick machine couldn't stop the Tories losing control of Newark and Sherwood council in the 2023 elections, which returned 14 Conservative councillors, 11 for Labour, 11 independents and 3 Lib Dems.  One of the Labour councillors has since defected to the Greens, but they are still part of the minority Labour administration which is running the show.

The independent members of the council are concentrated in the wards covering Newark and Balderton.  Castle ward had a close three-way result in 2023, with independent Adrian Amer winning with 35% of the vote against 34% for Labour and 31% for the defending Conservatives; Amer's numerical margin of victory was eight votes, 261 to 253.  Amer wnt on to stand in the 2024 general election as the Independent Network candidate for Newark, finishing sixth out of nine candidates with 1.5% of the vote.  The larger Balderton North and Coddington ward had been in Conservative hands until 2023, when it split its two seats between re-elected Conservative councillor Johno Lee and independent candidate Emma Oldham, who defeated outgoing Conservative councillor Betty Brooks.  Topline vote shares were 35% each for the Conservative slate and Oldham, and 18% for Labour.  Adrian Amer and Emma Oldham both stepped down from Newark and Sherwood council in September, with Oldham citing a health condition for her resignation while Amer's departure is understood to be for personal reasons.

Which sets up two fascinating by-elections, one of which - in Balderton North and Coddington - has no defending independent candidate.  We have a free-for-all, I repeat we have a free-for-all!  The Conservatives will want back the seat they lost in 2023, and they have selected Janette Barlow: she is the newly-elected Nottinghamshire county councillor for Collingham division, which covers the Coddington half of this ward and which she gained from an independent candidate in May.  The Labour candidate Tracey Jevons-Hazzard is a retired nurse who is a town councillor in Southwell, and she stood there in May's county elections.  Also standing are the Green Party's Martin Lunn and Reform UK's Kay Smith, who is a former local government solicitor.

For some reason the Castle ward by-election has attracted more interest with seven candidates standing.  They include two new independent candidates: Jane Harrison is endorsed by the Independents for Newark and District, which is the largest of the council's three independent groups, while Glenis Rix is a Newark town councillor.  Another town councillor on the ballot is Labour's Lisa Geary who has stood on several previous occasions for the district and county council, including in a 2021 district council by-election in the neighbouring Bridge ward.  A third town councillor standing here is the Conservatives' Matthew Skinner, who previously represented Beacon ward on Newark and Sherwood council but lost that seat in 2023.  Also on the ballot are Reform UK's Michelle Home, the Liberal Democrats' Alla Musson and the Greens' Bee Newboult.

<h2>Seales</h2>

South Derbyshire council; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Gareth Jones.

The cliché is that the UK's elections are won and lost in middle England.  Well, you can't get much more middle England than the village of Coton in the Elms, which is recognised as the farthest point in the UK from the sea.  We are 70 miles away from the Wash, the Dee Estuary or the Severn Estuary.
</p><p>
Despite that, you can almost get to Coton in the Elms by boat.  The village is one of six rural parishes making up Seales ward, which lies to the south-west of Swadlincote and is the southernmost ward of Derbyshire.  The ward's western boundary is the River Trent, just beyond which (via the bridge at Walton on Trent) is the Derby-Birmingham railway line, the Roman Road of Ryknield Street (now the A38), the Trent and Mersey Canal and a marina at Barton-under-Needwood.  From here it is possible to float to the North Sea, via the Trent and Mersey Canal, the navigable River Trent and the Humber estuary.  Or, if you go the other way along the Trent and Mersey Canal, you can float to the Irish Sea, or to the Severn Estuary via the West Midlands' canal network.
</p><p>
Seales ward (perhaps not surprisingly, given its location) is part of a local government district called South Derbyshire.  The ward was created in 2003 with two councillors as a merger of three previous single-member wards (Netherseal, Overseal and Walton) which were undersized, and it survived a boundary review in 2011 unchanged.
</p><p>
In 2019 the Conservative slate of Amy Wheelton, a farmer from Walton-on-Trent, and Andrew Brady won Seales ward with an increased majority of 51-30 over Labour.  Both of them were new candidates.  May 2019 was the fourth election in a row that the Conservatives had won a majority on South Derbyshire, although they did lose two seats nett for a 22-14 lead.  This didn't last.

Over the period 2020-21, the ruling Conservative group in South Derbyshire spectacularly fell apart.  Going into the 2021 Derbyshire county council elections, there were four vacant seats on South Derbyshire council following the resignations of Conservative councillors, including Seales ward councillor Andrew Brady: the COVID-19 pandemic meant that no by-elections could be held to fill them before May 2021.  In the meantime the other Seales ward councillor Amy Wheelton had been suspended from the Conservative party, and a number of other Conservatives had walked off to form a splinter group.  They removed the Conservative leadership of the council and installed a Labour minority administration.

Seales ward saw two by-elections in 2021, the first in May to replace Brady: in a straight Tory-Labour fight, the Conservatives increased their majority to 67-33.  Wheelton then resigned from the council in June for reasone which were not disclosed at the time: it subsequently turned out that she was being treated for breast cancer and was to undergo a mastectomy.  This procedure turned out to be a complete success, and subsequent chemotherapy was not required.

Following this better-than-expected medical news, Wheelton sought re-election to South Derbyshire council in the September 2021 by-election caused by her own resignation.  And she narrowly made it back in, defeating the Conservative candidate (who was the local county councillor) by 399 votes to 390.  In percentage terms that was 40% for Wheelton, 39% for the Conservatives and 19% for Labour.

The Conservative vote in South Derbyshire then proceeded to fall apart.  In May 2023 Labour gained overall control of South Derbyshire council, winning 23 seats to 10 for the Conservatives, 2 Lib Dems and Wheelton, who was re-elected in Seales ward with a stoking 51% of the vote; Labour gained the ward's other seat from the Conservatives by a 26-22 margin, the first time Seales ward had returned a Labour councillor since 2011.  In 2024 the Tories lost the bellwether South Derbyshire parliamentary seat, which is now slightly smaller than the district, to Labour on a swing of 22%; the Labour Samantha Niblett came to the Commons from a previous career in IT.  Amy Wheelton was an independent candidate in that election, finishing sixth out of seven candidates with 2.6% of the vote.  In 2025 the Conservatives lost control of Derbyshire county council to Reform UK and they fell from first to fourth place in the Linton division which covers Seales ward: Amy Wheelton was elected as the independent county councillor for Linton, with Reform UK in second.

The voters of Seales ward are now being called out for their third by-election in just over four years.  This is to replace the ward's Labour councillor Gareth Jones, who had been chair of South Derbyshire council's planning committee when he submitted his resignation in September.

Defending this difficult seat for Labour is Marie Haywood, who stood here for the county council in May and finished in third place in Linton division.  Independent candidate Graham Wood, who lives within the ward in the village of Overseal and has a background in architecture and planning, is endorsed by Amy Wheelton who is acting as his election agent.  The Conservatives have nominated David Bell, who stood for the county council in May in Swadlincote West division.  Also standing are Reform UK's Ian Baker, who is a retired police officer and who finished second to Wheelton in May's county elections; and the Lib Dems' Benjamin Hayes.  A Green Party candidate was also intending to stand here but her nomination papers were ruled out of order, so we have a ballot paper of five.

<h2>Fleckney</h2>

Harborough council, Leicestershire; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Stephen Bilbie.

For our final East Midlands poll of the week we travel a little off the beaten track to the village of Fleckney.  Located about nine miles south of Leicester,  Fleckney lies on country lanes in between the main commuication links going south of the city: the Grand Union Canal and the A6 towards Market Harborough lie to the east, while the A5199 towards Northampton runs to the west of the village.  Fleckney itself is a rather large village with 4,210 electors on the roll, dwarfing the four other tiny parishes which are included in Fleckney ward; its traditional industries were brickworking and hosiery manufacture.  The modern village is large enough to have its own industrial estate.

This is Leicester commuter territory in traditional Tory countryside, and it has a Tory MP to match.  The 2024 Parliamentary boundary changes transferred Fleckney ward into the South Leicestershire constituency represented by Alberto Costa, who was re-elected comfortably enough last year for his fourth term of office.  Costa now holds the powerful Commons position of chair of the Standards committee.

Fleckney ward's electoral history shows quite a lot of shifting around between parties.  The outgoing councillor Stephen Bilbie, a former chair of Harborough council who resigned in September after moving away from the area, contested Fleckney ward in 2011 on the Liberal Democrat ticket before being elected in 2015 as a Conservative.  In 2015 and 2019 Bilibe was elected alongside long-serving Tory councillor Charmaine Wood, who sought re-election in 2023 as an independent candidate and was defeated.  She lost her seat to Alan Birch, who had stood here at every election from 2003 to 2019 as an independent candidate, being elected as such in 2011, but who won his seat in 2023 as a Liberal Democrat; Birch polled almost twice as many votes as his running-mate, which is a clear sign of a personal vote.  Topline shares of the vote here in 2023 were 33% for the Conservatives, 27% for the Lib Dems, 15% for Labour and 14% for Wood.  Overall Harborough council is hung: the Conservatives are the largst party, but a traffic-light coalition of Liberal Democrat, Labour and Green councillors is in control.

We saw nearly as fragmented a result here in the 2025 Leicestershire county council elections, in which Fleckney ward is part of the Bruntingthorpe division.  This seat was narrowly lost by the Conservatives to Reform UK, with vote shares of 34% for the Faragist candidate, 31% for the Conservatives and 21% for the Lib Dems.

Who would bet on further such fragmentation in this by-election?  Defending for the Conservatives is Peter Critchley, who lives in the small parish of Saddington within this ward: he is a long-serving NHS doctor who was elected to Harborough council in a May 2021 by-election for Market Harborough - Little Bowden ward but lost his seat there in 2023.  The Liberal Democrats' Stephen Walkley was their candidate here in May's county elections and has a string of previous failed campaigns in Harborough district under his belt, while for those with longer memories he was the Liberal Party candidate for Hackney South and Shoreditch at the last Greater London Council elections in 1981; Walkley's career in retail includes working as the central buyer of ladies' hosiery for John Lewis, serving for 16 years as marketing director of the UK's largest net curtain company, and - for those of a certain age - being the mastermind behind Allders Jingle Bears.  Labour have selected Helen Morrison, who previously stood here in 2019.  There is no independent candidate this time, so completing the ballot in Fleckney ward are Jessie Jenkins for the Green Party and Reform UK's Jonny Austin, who will be hoping for a better performance than his fourth-place finish in July at the last Harborough council by-election in Market Harborough - Logan ward.  Coincidentally, that ward will be the venue for the next Harborough council by-election as well, on a date yet to be announced.

<h2>Lingfield, Crowhurst and Tandridge; and<br>
Westway</h2>

Tandridge council, Surrey; caused respectively by the resignations of Lingfield and Crowhurst Residents councillor Julie Duggan and Conservative councillor Ankita Sharma.

It's now time to make a return visit to a Surrey district that appeared in this column two weeks ago, when by-elections to the county council and to Tandridge council were previewed.  Since then we have had an announcement from central government that Surrey's local government is to be reorganised, with the county council and eleven district councils swept away in favour of two unitary councils, called East Surrey and West Surrey.  The plan is that elections to the new councils are to be held in May 2026, using new boundaries which had originally been drawn up for the cancelled 2025 Surrey county council election but with two councillors per division; and the new councils will take over from the old in April 2027.  The delayed 2026 Surrey county council election and the scheduled 2026 Surrey district council elections will be cancelled, with councillors' terms extended (or in the case of the county council, further extended) to abolition.

This move is prompted by the severe financial difficulties currently being experienced by Woking and Spelthorne councils, and to a lesser extent Runnymede council, together with the county council.  It's a continuation of the current trend for local government to become ever less local and ever more remote, and it's a slap in the face for those Surrey councils, and their councillors and staff, which have kept a relatively clean financial position and now find themselves punished for the actions of others with the abolition of their jobs and positions.  And this reorganisation might not even achieve its goal of putting Surrey's local government on a stable financial footing: the debts accrued by Runnymede, Spelthorne and Woking councils mean that the new West Surrey district might well be bankrupt on day one.  Regrettably, I have no doubt that we will see more such municipal arsonism from the so-called Department of Local Government in future.

For now, we have by-elections to cover to Tandridge council, which covers the eastern end of the Surrey county council area.  The district name is a reference to an ancient Hundred of Surrey, but there is also a Tandridge village in the countryside to the west of Oxted.

New ward boundaries for the 2024 Tandridge election placed Tandridge parish into a ward called "Lingfield and Crowhurst", which was officially renamed to the present "Lingfield, Crowhurst and Tandridge" a few months later by special resolutoin of the council.  This ward is based on the large village of Lingfield some distance to the south, and has a long thin shape running from the M25 nearly as far as East Grinstead.  Lingfield grew rapidly in population after the opening of the railway line to East Grinstead in 1884, and it came to wider notice for horseracing enthusiasts when Lingfield Park racecourse opened in 1890.  This course operates all year round, with both flat and jump racing taking place; Lingfield Park is at its busiest in the winter months, with frequent flat meetings taking place on its dedicated all-weather course.

Rather different in character is Tandridge's Westway ward, which is an almost entirely built-up area covering the western end of the town of Caterham.  This ward was previously dominated by Caterham Barracks, which served as a depot for the Foot Guards regiments until its closure in 1995; the barracks site has now been redeveloped for housing.  The presence of the barracks brought the Troubles to Caterham in August 1975, when the IRA bombed the Caterhan Arms pub on the corner of Coulsdon Road and Westway: 33 people were injured, including ten off-duty Welsh Guards soldiers.  Despite all this redevelopment there appears to be nowhere here which is suitable to serve as a polling station: the single polling place for the Westway by-election is at Caterham Hill library, which is on the street called Westway but outside the boundary of Westway ward.

The Tandridge district has similar boundaries to the East Surrey parliamentary seat, which has only ever returned Conservative MPs since its recreation in 1918.  Its MP Claire Coutinho was in Cabinet going into the 2024 general election as energy security and net zero secretary: after being re-elected comfortably last year for her second term of office, she is now the shadow minister both for that portfolio and for equalities.  The Conservatives also dominated the areas up for election today at the last Surrey county council elections in 2021, easily holding the Lingfield county division and gaining Caterham Hill from the Liberal Democrats.

Tandridge council, on the other hand, has been a disaster area for the Conservatives over recent cycles as more and more of their councillors fall victim to the rise of independent and residents groups on the council.  The 2024 elections here returned (deep breath) 11 Liberal Democrat councillors, 8 members of the Oxted and Limpsfield Residents Group, 7 Conservatives, 5 independents, 3 seats for the Godstone Residents, 3 seats for the Burstow, Horne and Outwood Residents, 2 seats for the Lingfield and Crowhurst Residents, 2 seats for the Dormansland and Felbridge Residents, 1 seat for the Bletchingley and Nutfield Residents, and 1 seat for the Whyteleafe Residents Group.  Subsequent by-elections in Oxted South ward in May and in Whyteleafe ward two weeks ago show no sign of a Tory revivial, while last month one of the remaining Conservative councillors walked off to join Reform UK leaving the party with just five seats plus the vacancy in Westway ward.  The Residents councillors total 19 out of 43 plus the vscancy in Lingfield, Crowhurst and Tandridge ward, and they have banded together to form a minority administration.

Both of these wards split their three seats in 2024.  Lingfield and Crowhurst ward (as it was then) gave 35% of the vote and 2 seats to the Lingfield and Crowhurst Residents slate, 27% to outgoing independent councillor Liz Lockwood who was re-elected, 17% to Labour and 12% to the Conservatives.

The Residents are not a factor in Westway ward, which on previous boundaries had been closely fought between the Conservatives and Lib Dems and had normally had one councillor from each party.  The 2024 boundary changes increased the ward's representation to three seats, but unaccountably the Liberal Democrats only put up two candidates - a decision that looks even more bizarre in retrospect, as they easily carried the ward.  Vote shares were 43% for the Lib Dems whose two candidates were both elected, 29% for the Conservatives who won the other seat, and 28% for Labour who were capable of winning this ward at the height of Tony Blair's powers.

This gives the Cosnervatives a tricky by-election defence in Westway, after their councillor Ankita Sharma tendered her resignation.  The task of defending this seat falls to Ethna Webster, who previously stood here in 2018: she a governor of a Surrey special needs school and a trustee of a local charity that provides housing for older ladies.  The Lib Dems' Martin Redman, who stood in Bletchingley and Nutfield ward in 2024 and has previosly been a regular candidate for the party in Godstone ward, has in his career built and managed successful businesses in surveying, development consultancy, and housebuilding.  Labour have reselected Robin Clements who has been their regular candidate for Westway ward in recent years.  This time Westway's voters have a ballot paper of four, as Sarah Barwick joins the fray for Reform UK.

In Lingfield, Crowhurst and Tandridge ward the Residents' defence is led by Tandridge parish councillor Alan Schmidt, who was their losing candidate here last year.  One independent candidate is hoping to join Liz Lockwood on the ward's delegation: Judy Moore was previously an independent Tandridge councillor from a June 2021 by-election in Felbridge ward until she lost her seat in the redrawn Dormansland and Felbridge ward in May 2024.  Moore was an independent candidate for East Surrey in the 2024 genreal election, finishing sixth out of seven candidates with 2.3%; before her election to Tandridge council she had been a regular candidate for UKIP, including featuring on that party's South East list for the 2019 European Parliament elections.  Labour have reselected Freyja Chapman who was a losing candidate here in 2024; the Conservatives have done the same with their nomination of Paul Greenhalgh.  Also on the ballot are the Lib Dems' Dave Wilkes, who was yet another losing candidate here in 2024, and Reform UK's Julia Searle who has a number of previous runs for UKIP under her belt, including for Surrey police and crime commissioner in 2016 and for Lingfield in the 2021 county council eletcions.

<h2>Okehampton South</h2>

West Devon council; caused by the resignation of Green Party councillor Malcolm Calder.

For our final by-election of the week it's time to go high.  The boundaries of Okehampton South ward include the twin summits of High Willhays and Yes Tor at 621 and 619 metres above sea level respectively.  In old money that's 2,039 and 2,031 feet respectively, which makes High Willhays and Yes Tor not only the highest point of the Dartmoor National Park but also the only summits in England south of Kinder Scout above 2,000 feet in altitude.  It's not always safe for hikers to travel up here: the summits lie within with the Army's Okehampton firing range, and according to the MoD's schedule (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dartmoor-firing-programme">link</a>) the red flags are up today indicating that firing is in progress and members of the public should keep out.

Would-be hikers might instead expend their shoe leather today on the campaign trail, at the bottom of the slopes in the town of Okehampton.  This is an old West Country town on the river Okement, which gave its name to the settlement: Okehampton is a corruption of the original name, which might otherwise have developed into something like Okementon.  Until 1988 when a bypass was built, the main A30 road to Cornwall passed through Okehampton town centre which was a major traffic bottleneck.

Okehampton South ward covers the southern parts of the town of the Okehampton and the parish of Okehampton Hamlets, which entirely surrounds the town.  The ward boundaries take in the town's secondary school, Okehampton College, and the Museum of Dartmoor Life.  Also here is Okehampton railway station, which reopened to passenger traffic in 2022 and has hourly trains east to Exeter.  As with the Levenmouth line with which we started this piece, the railway line to Okehampton had survived in use thanks to freight traffic: it also serves Meldon Quarry, which is located within this ward and has been supplying track ballast for the railways for over 150 years.

Naturally enough there was a castle at Okehampton, although it was located some distance south-west of the modern town.  In the 11th century the Norman magnate Baldwin fitz Gilbert had put down a revolt against Norman rule in Devon, and he erected Okehampton Castle as a base to watch for any further flickering signs of rebellion.  Okehampton Castle ended up as the base of the Earls of Devon, but its lord Henry Courtenay was executed by Henry VIII in 1538 and after that the castle fell into the ruinous state it is in today.

Okehampton was one of the rotten boroughs abolished by the Great Reform Act in 1832.  The right of election here back in the day was in the freeholders and freemen of the borough, but in practice Okehampton's elections were controlled by patrons.  Until the 1750s these were the Duke of Bedford and the local magnate Thomas Pitt who controlled one seat each, but in 1754 Pitt ran out of money and he pawned his interest in the seat to the government for a while.  A series of by-elections followed in short order for the government's seat in Okehampton, the first of which in 1756 returned the Cabinet minister and future Prime Minister William Pitt the Elder (yes, he was from that family).  Pitt the Elder served until 1757, when he was elected for Bath.

By the 1780s Thomas Pitt's interest in Okehampton had been sold to Earl Spencer (via Lord Clive), but elections here were starting to get fiery thanks to a dispute between two branches of the Luxmoore family, who held significant property in the town and effectively acted as the agents for the patrons.  The 1784 general election intially returned "Esquire" John Luxmoore and his running-mate Thomas Wiggens after the mayor had sworn in 35 new freemen just before the election, but the losing candidates Viscount Malden and Humphrey Minchin had this result overturned after petitioning the House of Commons.  The Duke of Bedford and Earl Spencer then tried the same trick in 1790 for their candidates John St Leger and Robert Ladbroke by having 72 new freemen of Okehampton created; but on petition all of those votes were struck out and St Leger and Ladbroke were unseated.  After that, Bedford and Spencer sold their interests in Okehampton's elections.  In 1807 the patronage of both Okehampton's seats was bought by local country gentleman Albany Savile for £60,000 (in 1807 prices), which shows just how expensive elections could be in those days.

There was drama of a different sort here in the 2024 general election.  Since 2010 Okehampton has been part of the Central Devon parliamentary seat represented by the shadow chancellor Mel Stride.  He was re-elected in 2024 for his fifth term of office, but only by 61 votes ahead of Labour candidate Ollie Pearson in one of the closest results of that eletcion.

Quite where the Labour vote in this seat came from is a bit of a mystery, because Labour are very weak here in local government.  They haven't contested Okehampton South ward since 2015 and there is no Labour candidate in this by-election.  West Devon council as a whole has just one Labour councillor, who represents Bere Ferrers - which is not in the Central Devon constituency.  The council is hung, with the latest composition having 11 Conservatives, 10 independent councillors, 5 Lib Dems, 3 Greens, 1 Labour and this vacancy; an anti-Conservative rainbow coalition is in control under an independent council leader.

In West Devon council elections Okehampton South returned two Conservatives in 2015, but the Tories lost one of those seats in 2019 to independent candidate Paul Vachon and the other in 2023 to the Green Party's Malcolm Calder.  Topline vote shares here in 2023 were 36% for Vachon, 34% for the Greens and 30% for the Conservatives, whose outgoing councillor Julie Yelland polled nearly twice as many votes as her running-mate - a clear sign of a large personal vote.  The 2025 Devon county council result in Okehampton Rural didn't bear much resemblance to this, as that seat was a Reform UK gain from the Conservatives.

This by-election is to replace the Green Party's Malcolm Calder, who has stood down on health grounds.  This news may well have slipped under the radar a bit, because there is no defending Green Party candidate.  We have a free-for-all, I repeat we have a free-for-all!  Neither is there a Reform UK candidate, which breaks a streak going back some months where the Faragists have stood in every available by-election.

Instead we have an all-female ballot paper of three, but even this small number of candidates reveals a split on the Conservative side.  The Tories have selected Lois Samuel, who was the Devon county councillor for Okehampton Rural from 2021 until she stood down in May.  It would appear that this has not pleased Julie Yelland, the long-serving Conservative ward councillor who lost her seat in 2023; Yelland, who still sits on Okehampton town council and is a former mayor of the town, is standing as an independent candidate.  This might create an opening for retired teacher and Okehampton Hamlets parish councillor Jan Goffey, who has served twice as mayor of Okehampton and is a trustee of the Museum of Dartmoor Life: Goffey is standing for the Lib Dems, who are contesting this ward for the first time since the current boundaries were introduced in 2015.
