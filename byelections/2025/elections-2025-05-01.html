<!-- 1st May 2025 -->
Welcome to the annual Andrew's Previews megapreview, covering everything that goes on in the ordinary local elections in England on 1st May 2025.
</p><p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
</p><p>
I started last year's megapreview by noting that 2024 marked the 50th anniversary of England's present local government structure, which was (mostly) introduced on 1st April 1974 and has been tinkered with ever since.  "It remains to be seen whether the whole shebang can last another 50 years."
</p><p>
Since then we have had a change of government in Westminster, and the new Labour administration has immediately decided that local government reorganisation is the way to try and stop more and more of our councils going bsnkrupt.  The councils which tend to be in the most financial trouble are our county councils and county-sized unitary councils, so naturally the answer chosen is to load more services onto their council tax base by abolishing the tier underneath - the shire districts and boroughs.  Over the winter the relevant government department invited applications to postpone the scheduled 2025 county elections in counties with a more advanced plan for reorganisation, and some of those applications were granted.
</p><p>
Those postponements have left what was already going to be a quiet year in seat terms as the quietest set of local elections since 1975 (apart from 2020, which we do not talk about), and they are concentrated in the shire counties of England with very little going on in the big cities.  On the menu this year are elections to 24 councils covering around 1,600 seats, of which 14 are old-style councils, 8 are unitary councils descended from former county councils, 1 is a metropolitan borough (Doncaster) and the other is the Isles of Scilly, which is <em>sui generis</em>.  Also up for election are the borough mayors of Doncaster and North Tyneside, the existing combined authority mayors of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough, and the West of England, and two new combined authority mayors in Hull and East Yorkshire, and Greater Lincolnshire.  We also have 94 local by-elections to bring you, which will fill 96 casual vacancies (there are two by-elections for two seats) in other councils.  As is traditional, this piece will also include the annual <em>In memoriam</em> section where we pay tribute to councillors who have passed away over the last year.  Finally, the first Parliamentary Special of the new term in Runcorn and Helsby will be the subject of a separate post.
</p><p>
With the exception of the by-elections and the two new combined authority mayoral posts, all the seats up for election today were last contested in May 2021 when the political context was very different.  We were on our way out of the COVID-19 pandemic, and those local elections marked a very important return to normality as the vaccination programme continued its work.  This contributed to a very good performance for the ruling Conservative Party, which was partly ascribed to a "vaccine bounce" and which in many cases seemed to confirm the Brexit-related realignment of politics that had been seen in the December 2019 general election.  The BBC's projected national share of the vote in May 2021 gave 36% to the Conservatives, 29% to Labour and 17% to the Liberal Democrats.
</p><p>
Over the following three-and-a-bit years, the Conservative government proceeded to blow all of those advantages.  Their vote evaporated in the face of economic stagnation, high inflation, a series of personal scandals from the Prime Ministers downwards and a general impression of incompetence in government.  The equivalent projected national share in the May 2024 local elections - when all of England and Wales had something to vote for, thanks to the police and crime commissioners being up for re-election - gave 34% to Labour, 25% to the Conservatives, 17% to the Liberal Democrats and 12% to the Green Party.  The July 2024 general election, called shortly afterwards, had rather similar vote shares for the top two: 34% for Labour, 24% for the Conservatives, 14% to Reform UK who had fielded too few candidates to register a meaningful score in May, 12% to the Liberal Democrats and 6% to the Greens.  In most European countries political fragmentation like this would result in a Labour-led coalition government: instead England's first-the-past-post sytem gave a massive Parliamentary majority to the Labour party.
</p><p>
The Labour polling lead has since evaporated in its turn as a bunch of governmental neophytes try to grapple with pretty much the same economic and societal issues that the Conservatvies failed to handle.  However, the Conservatives have not recovered in the polls and they have indeed fallen further: instead, the beneficiary so far has been Reform UK with what appears at first sight to be a straight swing from Labour since July.  The Britain Elects poll tracker, as of 11th April, gives 25% to Reform UK, 24% to Labour, 22% to the Conservatives, 14% to the Liberal Democrats and 9% to the Green Party; compared with the May 2021 projected national share, Labour are down 5 points, the Conservatives are down 14 points and the Lib Dems are down three points.  No meaningful comparison is possible for Reform UK, which ran very few candidates in May 2021.  They have not made that mistake again: in fact, Reform UK are running the most candidates of any party in May 2025, which is an impressive organisational feat.  All this suggests we are on track for large Conservative seat losses, with any losses for Labour tempered by the fact that they aren't defending all that many seats anyway.
</p><p>
The national political scene affects the local one in the sense that a rising tide lifts all boats, but that doesn’t mean that the tide rises to the same level in all harbours. Local elections are local, and this column is here to describe the local scene. In the rest of this piece I’ll go through England in detail, painting a more local and more varied picture for you. Links given are to results from the Local Elections Archive Project; while the maps are from 2021 and as such might not reflect the lines on which the election will actually be drawn if there are new ward boundaries this year. Council compositions were correct when this piece was drafted over the Easter weekend. Without further ado, let’s get out into the country:
</p><p>
<h2>North East</h2>
</p><p>
The North East already has an entirely single-tier model of local government, after the shire districts in County Durham and Northumberland were abolished in 2009.  The former county councils there are both up for election today.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/northd21s.svgz" alt="Northumberland, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
<b>Northumberland</b> council has been under Conservative control since 2017, mostly as a minority.  The 2021 elections here did return a bare Conservative majority with 34 seats against 21 Labour, 7 independents, 3 Lib Dems and 2 Greens, but that disappeared a few months later when the Tories lost a by-election to the Lib Dems in Hexham East.  Labour carried the county in the 2024 Northumbria PCC elections with a 47-31 lead over the Conservatives (there was no Reform UK candidate), and Labour won all the constituencies covering Northumberland in July 2024 including impressive wins in the rural seats of Berwick/Morpeth and Hexham.  The Conservatives broke through in the Blyth Valley area in 2021 but fell to third place behind Reform UK in 2024 in the Cramlington and Killingworth constituency, and Reform might fancy those seats in particular.  Northumberland is one of the very few councils this year which will count overnight, although the sheer size of the county means that the final results are unlikely to be declared before dawn.
</p><p>
The Cramlington and Killingworth constituency straddles the boundary between Northumberland and the borough of <b><a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/ik3y">North Tyneside</a></b>, whose Labour elected mayor Dame Norma Redfearn is standing down after three terms of office.  None of her three wins went to transfers under the old supplementary vote system because Redfearn always polled over 50%: in 2021 her lead over the Conservatives was 53-31.  To succeed Redfearn Labour have selected Karen Clark, who is currently a councillor for Longbenton and Benton ward and is the council's cabinet member for public health and wellbeing: should she win the mayoralty, a by-election for her council seat would follow in short order.  The same would apply to the Conservative candidate Liam Bones, who represents Preston with Preston Grange ward on the council and is the leader of North Tyneside council's Conservative group.  Also standing are Chloe-Louise Reilly for the Greens, John Appleby for the Lib Dems, independent candidate Cath Davies (a former Labour councillor for Preston ward who is standing on a ticket of abolishing the mayoralty), John Falkenstein for Reform UK and independent candidate Martin Uren (standing on a "fresh start" platform).
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/durham21s.svgz" alt="Durham, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
South of the Tyne we have elections to <b>Durham</b> council where Labour lost control in 2021 after a century of power: they were still the largest party with 53 seats, but they were outvoted by 24 Conservatives, 22 independents, 17 Lib Dems, 5 Derwentside Independents, 4 councillors for the North East Party (who have a powerbase in Peterlee) and 1 Green.  A rainbow coalition is running the show under a Lib Dem leader.  There are new boundaries here with a big cut to the number of councillors.  In by-elections since 2021 Labour have gained three Durham council seats (in Ferryhill, West Auckland and Chester-le-Street East) and held three others (in Dawdon, Horden and Coxhoe).  Labour now have a full set of MPs for County Durham and they polled almost 60% here in the 2024 Durham PCC elections, but Reform UK came second across the county in July and they appear to be giving this one a go.  RUK even a high-profile candidate in the form of former GB News favourite Darren Grimes, who is standing for his native ward of Annfield Plain and Tanfield.  This could be one to watch.
</p><p>
We have one council by-election taking place in this region, in the <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/iwtv">Throston</a> ward of Hartlepool which this column visited in October 2022.  This poll is to replace the Labour winner of that by-election Cameron Sharp, a young man who works as a history teacher: he has put his career first by applying for and accepting a teaching job with the council, and as a result he has had to stand down as a councillor.  Labour had a big lead in this ward in 2024 when they gained a seat from a retiring independent councillor, and their candidate Lyndsey Allen - an NHS analytics consultant - will be seeking to hold the Throston Grange estate against competition from Veronica Nicholson for the Conservatives and Amanda Napper for Reform UK.

<h2>North West</h2>
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/lancashire21s.svgz" alt="Lancs, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
The only remaining county council in the North of England is <b>Lancashire</b>, which has had a Conservative majority since 2017.  The 2021 elections here returned 48 Conservatives, 32 Labour, 2 Lib Dems and 2 Greens; in September 2023 Labour gained a by-election from the Conservatives in Chorley Rural West.
</p><p>
In the 2024 PCC elections Labour had a 46-37 lead over the Conservatives across the Lancashire county council area, while two months later Labour won all of the county's parliamentary seats except for Fylde, which the Conservatives held, and Chorley which is the Speaker's seat.  The Tories remain in majority control of Fylde and Wyre councils and run Ribble Valley in coalition with independent councillors; Lancaster council has a Green-led coalition in place, Pendle and Burrnley have coalitions led by independent groups (in both cases the council leaders are ex-Labour councillors who quit the party over Gaza), while the remaining Lancashire districts (Rossendale, Hyndburn, Preston, South Ribble, Chorley and West Lancashire) have Labour majorities.  Lancashire will be a difficult council for the Conservatives to hold on current polling, but as can be seen there are a lot of subplots going on here and we will probably see different areas of the county swinging in different ways.
</p><p>
There are five council by-elections combined with the Lancashire county elections, including a return visit to <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i32v">Vivary Bridge</a> ward in northern Colne which had a by-election only two montha ago.  On that occasion the Tories lost a seat to the Lib Dems and actually finished third behind Reform UK; this time the Conservatives have another seat to defend following the resignation of Tom Ormerod, who was forced to resign in February after it was revaled that he was thousands of pounds in arrears with his council tax.  This time the Tory defence has fallen to Julie Green, while veteran local Lib Dem figure David Clegg and Reform UK's Marion Atkinson both look to have a decent chance of winning with Labour's Philip Heyworth and the Greens' Benjamin Harrop likely to be further back.
</p><p>
Colne is now in the same Parliamentary seat is Clitheroe on the far side of Pendle Hill, and we travel there for a by-election in <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/irku">St Mary's</a> ward which covers western Clitheroe.  This normally elected Lib Dem councillors but was gained in a by-election last July by Labour candidate Bill Holden, who beat the Conservatives by just 14 votes with the Lib Dems pushed into third.  Unfortunately Holden died in February while he was on holiday in Malta, so the voters are being called out for the second by-election of this term.  Lavour candidate Mike Willcox will defend this three-way marginal from the Conservatives' Kristian Torgersen, the Lib Dems' Stephen Sutcliffe, Reform UK's Warren Goldsworthy and the Greens' Grace McMeekin.
</p><p>
We have a further Labour defence on Chorley council, in the much safer ward of <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/iqvv">Chorley East</a> to replace resigning councillor Zara Khan.  Her mother Hasina Khan was re-elected as a Labour councillor for the same ward last year with a very large majority, and defending Labour candidate Ian Cardwell should be favoured against Sue Baines for the Conservatives, Aamir Khansaheb for the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition, Anne Calderbank for the Green Party, independent candidate Moira Crawford and Martin Topp of Reform UK.
</p><p>
The Green Party have a seat to defend on Lancaster council in <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i6jy">John O'Gaunt</a> ward, which is located in eastern Lancaster and includes the high ground of Williamson Park.  This ward, which is home to a large number of Lancaster University students, was quite closely fought between the Greens and Labour in 2023.  We may well see a similar battle between the Greens' Wilson Colley and Labour candidate Dave McGrath Wilkinson, with the Lib Dems' Ethan Weir-Preston and Reform UK's Martyn Sutton also in the mix.  Surprisingly the Conservatives have not found a candidate here.
</p><p>
In Fleetwood, the new Blackpool North and Fleetwood MP Lorraine Beavers has vacated her seats on both the county council and Wyre council.  Beavers' county council term only had a few weeks left to run and her successor will be elected today in the ordinary course of events; while her seat on Wyre council will be filled by a by-election in <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/is0r">Park</a> ward which lies in southern Fleetwood.  Anybody entering the town by road or by tram will pass through here.  This was safely Labour when Beavers was first elected in 2023, but in fact she gained her seat from a UKIP councillor who hadn't sought re-election; as such this could well end up as a close contest between defending Labour candidate Rachel Wilkinson and Reform UK's Alice Jones.  JJ Fitzgerald of the Conservatives might hope to sneak through the middle.
</p><p>
Our other two North West by-elections are both in historic Lancashire.  One of them is to replace another new MP, as Elsie Blundell of Heywood and Middleton North has vacated her Rochdale council seat.  This is in <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/idnx">Balderstone and Kirkholt</a> ward in the south of the town, which should be safe enough for defending Labour candidate Leanne Greenwood.  Second place here in 2024 went to William Howarth, who had been an independent candidate in the February 2024 Rochdale by-election on an anti-child sexual abuse ticket; after George Galloway won Howarth flocked to his banner, and in May 2024 Howarth finished as runner-up in Balderstone and Kirkholt ward on the ticket of the Workers Party of Britain.  George Galloway is no longer the MP here, and Billy Howarth is standing in this by-election as an independent candidate while the official Workers Party of Britain candidate is Laura Pugh; also on the ballot are Mudassar Razzaq for the Conservatives, Martyn Savin for the Greens, Chariss Peacock for the Lib Dems and Jordan Tarrant-Short for Reform UK.
</p><p>
Finally we come to <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i5us">Great Sankey North and Whittle Hall</a> ward, which covers New Town and later development on the edge of Warrington, plus some of the large warehouses which have sprung up on the old Burtonwood airfield site.  Charlotte Bond is looking to defend this seat for Labour following the resignation of Janet Henshaw.  This ward returned a full slate of Labour candidates in both 2021 and 2024, but last year the Labour slate were run close by independent candidate Nigel Catlow who is standing again; he is joined by the Conservatives' Chuck Eriobuna whose name contains all the vowels, the Lib Dems' Allan Bird and Reform UK's Carl Knapper.
</p><p>
There are no elections today in Cumbria, Merseyside, Blackpool, Blackburn with Darwen, or any Greater Manchester or Cheshire ward not covered above.  Except for those wards included in the Runcorn and Helsby constituency, whose Parliamentary Special will be the subject of a separate Preview.

</p><p>
There are no council by-elections today in Yorkshire, so residents of the White Rose county can concentrate on the two ordinary contests taking place today.  The mayor and council are both up for election together in <b>Doncaster</b>, the only metropolitan borough which polls this year.  We will get the mayoral result overnight, with the council following on Friday afternoon.
</p><p>
The 2021 Doncaster council election returned 40 Labour councillors against 11 Conservatives, 3 Mexborough localists and one Edlington and Warmsworth localist.  The mayor of Doncaster is also Labour: Ros Jones has served since 2013 when she defeated the English Democrats mayor Peter Davies, and in 2021 she won a third term of office by leading the Conservatives 44-29 on first preferences and 60-40 in the runoff.  The borough voted 51% Labour in the 2024 South Yorkshire PCC election, and Labour hold all of the parliamentary seats here.
</p><p>
Labour's Ros Jones is seeking a fourth term of office as Mayor of Doncaster.  The Conservative candidate is Nick Fletcher, who was the MP for Don Valley from 2019 to 2024 and lost re-election last year in Doncaster East and the Isle of Axholme despite favourable boundary changes.  Also standing on a long ballot are Frank Calladine, who was third here in 2021 as an independent candidate and is now standing for the far-right British Democratic Party; Andrew Walmsley for the Yorkshire Party; Julie Buckley for the Greens; Alexander Jones for Reform UK; David Bettney for the Social Democratic Party; Andy Hiles for the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition; Ahsan Jamil for the Workers Party of Britain; Mihai Melencuic for the Lib Dems; and independent candidates Richie Vallance and Doug Wright.  Intending Labour and Reform UK voters should check carefully which Jones they are voting for.
</p><p>
Over in the East Riding, meanwhile, we have the inaugural election for <b>Mayor of Hull and East Yorkshire</b> in what looks to be a fascinatingly unpredictable contest.  This area pairs off the city of Kingston upon Hull with the rural East Riding of Yorkshire, two areas of roughly equal headcount with very different voting patterns.  The East Riding has a full slate of three Conservative MPs, and its council is run by a minority Conservative administration: the 2023 elections here returned 29 Conservatives, 22 Lib Dems, 9 independents, 4 Labour and 3 councillors for the Yorkshire Party (in Bridlington South ward).  A by-election in South East Holderness ward in July last year, on the undercard of the general election, was won by Reform UK - RUK's first ever council by-election win.  (Their total of council by-election wins now is in the high teens.)  Hull has a full slate of three Labour MPs, but the city council has a Liberal Democrat majority and the Lib Dems actually managed to carry Hull in the 2024 Humberside PCC elections.  Across Hull and the East Riding, vote shares in that election were very close three ways: 35% for the Conservatives, 34% for Labour and 30% for the Lib Dems, with the Tories' weakness in the city and Labour's weakness in the East Riding more or less cancelling each other out.  The Lib Dems and Reform UK are clearly both hoping to come through the middle.
</p><p>
For this new position I will take the candidates in alphabetical order.  Top of the ballot paper is Reform UK's Luke Campbell, a former professional boxer who won a gold medal in the bantamweight category at the 2012 London Olympics and twice fought for world titles at lightweight (losing to Jorge Linares in 2017 and Vasiliy Lomachenko in 2019).  He was appointed MBE in 2013 for services to boxing.  The Yorkshire Party have selected Rowan Halstead, who was an unsuccessful candidate for Hull city council in May 2024 and for Hull North and Cottingham in July 2024.  The Conservatives' Anne Handley is the leader of East Riding council, where she represents Goole North ward.  The Green candidate Kerry Harrison, who works at a special needs school, was also an unsuccessful candidate for Hull North and Cottingham in last year's general election.  Labour's Margaret Pinder, who comes to politics from an international legal career, had a near-miss at getting into Parliament when she narrowly lost in Beverley and Holderness last year.  And at the bottom of the ballot paper is the Lib Dems' Michael Ross, who is the leader of Hull city council where he represents Beverley and Newland ward.
</p><p>
There are no local elections this year in West Yorkshire, North Yorkshire (apart from the inaugural elections to the parish-level Harrogate and Scarborough town councils), Barnsley, Rotherham or Sheffield.

<h2>East Midlands</h2>
</p><p>
We may have had slim pickings in the North this year, but things will now pick up as we head into the Midlands.  It's time to cross the Humber Bridge into our second new combined authority mayoral election, which covers "<b>Greater Lincolnshire</b>" - that is, the present Lincolnshire county council area plus the North Lincolnshire and North East Lincolnshire council areas, which were hived off into Humberside in the 1970s and are now coming back.
</p><p>
Following the 2024 general election this area has six Conservative MPs, three Labour and one Reform UK (Richard Tice in Boston and Skegness) with two constituencies straddling the boundary: Doncaster East and the Isle of Axholme (held by Labour) and Rutland and Stamford (held by the Conservatives).  If we add together the votes cast in May last year for Lincolnshire PCC with the votes cast south of the river for Humberside PCC, we get 40% for the Conservatives, 33% for Labour and 12% for the Lib Dems, with Labour carrying Lincoln and the Conservatives topping the poll in all other districts.  Reform UK were third in the Lincolnshire PCC election last year with 14%, but they didn't stand in Humberside.
</p><p>
Again, I'll take the candidates for this election in alphabetical order.  We met the Greens' Sally Horscroft very recently when she stood in the Park by-election for Lincoln city council last month (she finished fifth).  Reform UK have selected Dame Andrea Jenkyns, who was the Conservative MP for Morley and Outwood from 2015 to 2024 and lost re-election last year in the successor seat of Leeds South East and Morley.  Her nomination papers give an address in North Kesteven, but Jenkyns' Wikipedia article states she still lives in her former West Yorkshire constituency which has led to concerns being raised as to whether she is in fact eligible to stand in Greater Lincolnshire: if she wins, this might be one for the Election Court to sort out.  Jenkyns has previous form for falling foul of eligibility rules, as in 2009 she was elected as a Lincolnshire county councillor for Boston North West but then disqualified after it became clear she was working for a council-run body as a music tutor.  There are no such concerns over the Lincolnshire Independents' leader and candidate Marianne Overton's connection to the county: she is a long-standing Lincolnshire county councillor and North Kesteven district councillor who leads the independent group on the Local Government Association.  Overton was appointed MBE in 2014 for services to local government, and she has stood several times for Parliament in Sleaford and North Hykeham, saving her deposit in 2010, 2015 and the 2016 by-election.  Labour candidate Jason Stockwood will not be helped in this election by giving an address in Cheshire East on his nomination papers, but he qualifies through his work as joint majority shareholder and former chairman of Grimsby Town FC: this is his first election campaign.  The Conservative candidate Rob Waltham is the leader of North Lincolnshire council, on which he represents Brigg and Wolds ward: he also has an MBE for services to local government, which was awarded in 2017.  And at the wrong end of the ballot paper (as he must have ezpected, given his surname) is the Lib Dems' Trevor Young, who is the leader of West Lindsey council.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/lincs21s.svgz" alt="Lincs CC, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
This poll will be combined with elections to Lincolnshire county council, which had a large Conservative majority when it was last contested in 2021: 54 Conservatives against 5 independents, 4 Labour, 3 Lib Dems, 3 South Holland Independents and one Lincolnshire Independent (Overton).  Six by-elections here over the last four years have all been held by the defending party (four Conservatives, one South Holland Independent and one Labour).  The Conservatives have overall control of North Kesteven and South Holland councils and minority control of East Lindsey, but Boston council has an independent majority, South Kesteven is run by an independent-led coalition and West Lindsey council has Lib Dem minority control.  The PCC elections here in 2024 had 37% for the Conservatives, 30% for Labour and 14% for Reform UK, who will be looking for significant gains here - the 2013 Lincolnshire county council elections returned 16 UKIP councillors, so that's something to aim for.

The voters of <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i9tr">Trinity</a> ward in Boston will have to juggle three ballot papers, for the mayoralty, the county council and a by-election to the district council.  This ward covers the eastern part of Boston town centre together with housing along the Spilsby Road in the north-east of the town.  Like most wards in Boston, Trinity in 2023 returned the Boston Independent slate - although the second Boston Independent candidate Jyothi Arayambath, a locum NHS psychiatrist, won the ward's second and final seat by just one vote over Conservative candidate Yvonne Stevens, 381 to 380.Arayambath has now resigned her seat, and the Boston Indepndents' defending candidate is consultant paediatrician Shafqat Bashir.  The Conservatives have selected Katie Chalmers, who won a Boston council by-election in Skirbeck ward in May 2021, and also standing are Richard Thornalley for "Blue Revolution", Jonathan Noble for Reform UK and Jonathan Wolf for the Greens.

Moving west of the Trent we have a fascinating battle for control of <b>Nottinghamshire</b>  county council, which returned a Conservative majority in 2021: 37 seats against 15 Labour, 10 Ashfield Independents, 3 other independents and a single Lib Dem.  But the Tories are now down to just one MP (Robert Jenrick in Newark) and one district council (Rushcliffe) in the county.  Bassetlaw, Mansfield and Gedling councils have Labour majorities (with Mansfield also having a Labour mayor), Newark and Sherwood council has a Labour/Green coalition, Broxtowe council had a Labour majority until the Labour group split down the middle recently with the splinter group currently being in control, and Ashfield council is dominated by a man whose capacity to turn serious legal trouble into popular support is second only to Donald Trump: that's Jason Zadrozny, leader of the Ashfield Independents <s>cult</s> political party.  The Zadroznyite <s>Make Ashfield Great Again</s> Ashfield Independents dominate Ashfield council and the district's delegation to the county council, but Jay-Z has had less success at Parliamentary level: in 2024 the Ashfield constituency re-elected former Conservative MP Lee Anderson under his new Reform UK colours.
</p><p>
Nottinghamshire is full of marginal parliamentary seats: in 2019 the Conservatives swept all eight constituencies in the Nottinghamshire county council area, while in July 2024 Labour won everything except Ashfield and Newark.  In the May 2024 Nottinghamshire PCC election Labour carried every district in Nottinghamshire and had a 49-37 lead over the Conservatives in the county council area.  The simultaneous election for Mayor of the East Midlands, which had a wider choice of candidates, had 39% for Labour, 33% for the Conservatives (who did manage to carry Newark and Sherwood) and 9% for Reform UK across the same area; on that occasion the Conservative candidate was Ben Bradley, the leader of Nottinghamshire county council and (at the time) MP for Mansfield.  There are a lot of Conservative county council seats in Mansfield in particular which look rather vulnerable on current polling, and Bradley clearly has a fight on his hands to keep the council leadership.
</p><p>
There are three by-elections being combined with these polls, two of which are to replace Labour MPs who joined the Commons at the last election.  Michelle Welsh, the MP for Sherwood Forest, is standing down from the county council at this election and she has also vacated her Gedling council seat in <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/ikvr">Porchester</a> ward, which is part of the easterm Nottingham suburb of Carlton and very much part of Nottingham's urban sprawl but has never been annexed by the city.  Maybe the forthcoming local government reorganisation can sort this out?  Porchester is a safe Labour ward: defending candidate Pauline Allan takes on the Conservatives' Mark Dillon, the Greens' Richard Sutton, the Lib Dems' Robert Swift and Reform UK's John Semens, who has probably heard all the jokes that are coming into your head right now.
</p><p>
The new Labour MP for Rushcliffe and former Bassetlaw council leader James Naish has vacated his council seat at the other end of the county in <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/isch">Sturton</a> ward, which covers a very rural part of Bassetlaw district on the western side of the River Trent.  The ward includes the large power station complex at West Burton A, which was one of the UK's last coal-fired power stations until it was decommissioned in 2023, and the gas-fired West Burton B which is still in operation.  Naish's previous career in the energy sector meant he was well-placed to take the ward over in 2019 upon the retirement of a long-serving independent councillor, and in 2023 he was re-elected with 78% of the vote in a straight fight with the Conservatives.  There won't be a straight fight this time: Labour's Colette Roberts is opposed by James Purle for the Conservatives, Simon Russell of the Lib Dems and Matt Turner of Reform UK.
</p><p>
We also have a Bassetlaw council by-election in the neighbouring <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/ibch">Beckingham</a> ward, which faces Gainsborough on the far side of the Trent.  This follows the retirement of long-serving independent councillor Joan Sanger, who was first elected to Bassetlaw council in 1996 and had represented Beckingham ward continuously since 2012; she was appointed MBE in the 2018 New Year honours for services to the charity "and to the community in Beckingham, South Yorkshire".  Beckingham has always been part of Nottinghamshire: presumably the honours list compilers were confused by its Doncaster postcode.  Sanger has signed the nomination papers for new independent candidate Mark Watson, a hospital consultant who has previously represented the neighbouring Everton ward on Bassetlaw council (he narrowly lost his seat to the Conservatives in 2023).  Watson is up against the Conservatives' Tracey Taylor, the Lib Dems' Leon Duveen and Reform UK's Warren Limber.

</p><p>
Similar dynamics to Nottinghamshire are going in <b>Derbyshire</b>, which returned a large Conservative majority in 2021: 45 councillors against 14 Labour, 4 Lib Dems and 1 Green.  Labour have since gained two seats from the Conservatives in by-elections, in Long Eaton in October 2022 and Swadlincote South in August 2023.  The Conservative majority may be large, but the fact that it may not be deep is demonstrated by Labour sweeping all 11 Derbyshire constituencies in 2024: in 2019 Labour had only won Chesterfield and Derby South, with the Conservatives winning the other nine seats.
</p><p>
Those results in July were presaged by the May 2024 results for Derbyshire police and crime commissioner, in which the county council area voted 43% for Labour, 32% for the Conservatives and 15% for Reform UK; and in the East Midlands mayoral election, which turned in 38% for Labour, 29% for the Conservatives and 13% for the Greens (the Greens didn't stand for PCC).  In both of those contests the Conservatives only carried Derbyshire Dales district, and then only narrowly.  Every district within the county council area now has a Labour majority except for Derbyshire Dales, where the Lib Dems lead a traffic-light coalition.  Labour did so poorly here in 2021 that any gains from Reform UK would be likely to come disproportionately from the Conservatives.
</p><p>
As if to demonstrate this, five of the six Derbyshire district councils seats which Labour are defending in by-elections today are in Conservative-held conuty divisions.  The exception is <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/iupy">Brampton East and Boythorpe</a> ward in western Chesterfield, which split its two seats between Labour and the Lib Dems in 2023.  The Labour councillor Jonathan Davies has now vacated his seat after being elected last year as MP for Mid Derbyshire, setting up what promises to be a close contest between defending Labour candidate Pauline Twigg (a retired midwife who contested the other Brampton ward in 2023) and the Lib Dems' Keith Falconer (a former Chesterfield councillor whose wife Glenys is the other councillor for this ward).  Also on a long ballot paper are Katherine Noble for the Greens, David Jones for CANDI (the Chesterfield and North Derbyshire Independents), independent candidate Jane Hindle, Courtney James for Reform UK and Jacob Rodgers for the Conservatives.
</p><p>
Another new Labour MP who has left their former council seat behind is Amber Valley's Linsey Farnsworth, who was previously a councillor for the cumbersomely-named Amber Valley ward of <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/ir5x">Kilburn, Denby, Holbrook and Horsley</a> which covers several villages to the east of Belper.  This ward split its three seats in 2023 between Labour's Farnsworth and two Conservative councillors, so Labour's defending candidate John Cowings (a UNISON caseworker) has work to do to see off the Conservatives' Matt Murray (who was the runner-up in this ward two years ago).  Nicola Perry of the Greens, Sarah Gent of the Lib dems and independent Alex Stevenson (the outgoing Conservative county councillor for Greater Heanor division, which does not cover this ward) also stand.  Labour should be on safer ground in <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/iq5x">Ironville and Riddings</a> ward, located in the Erewash valley to the south of Alfreton, where Rebecca Grundy has stood down; here defending candidate James Whitmore takes on Sarah Tucker for the Conservatives, independent candidate Philip Rose who previously stood here in 2023 for Reform UK, Dave Hatchett for the Greens and Paul Slater of the Lib Dems.
</p><p>
Labour also have three seats to defend further down the Erewash valley in Erewash district, all in wards which look safe enough.  In <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/ifgs">Cotmanhay</a> ward (covering the north end of Ilkeston) new Labour candidate Paul Opiah (editor-in-chief of the Ilkeston Life community newspaper) takes on the Conservatives' Sue Beardsley, the Greens' Lauren McKie, Reform UK's Dan Price and the Lib Dems' Angela Togni.  <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/ilgs">Kirk Hallam and Stanton-by-Dale</a> ward (villages west and south of Ilkeston) is defended by Labour candidate Richard Pollard (an engineer at a family bakery in Derby) against the Conservatives' Andrew Price and the Greens' Deena Draycott.  And <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/irgs">Nottingham Road</a> ward (eastern Long Eaton) sees Labour's Denise Mellors (a former leader of Erewash council's Labour group) challenged by the Conservatives' Lorna Maginnis and the Greens' Mell Catori.  These seats were respectively vacated by Alex Breene, Emma Moore and Emma Plummer.

</p><p>
<b>Leicestershire</b> county council looks much safer for the Conservatives.  In 2021 the Tories won 42 seats here against 9 Lib Dems and just 4 Labour county councillors; in May 2024 the Lib Dems gained Burbage from the Conservatives in a by-election.  That was on the same day as the Leicestershire PCC election which was very close between the Conservatives and Labour; however, with Leicester taken out of the equation the Conservative lead becomes a much healthier 40-33, with the Lib Dems in third on 17%.  Labour carried only North West Leicestershire district.  The Conservatives still hold the majority of MPs within the Leicestershire county council area, with Labour holding the Loughborough and North West Leicestershire constituencies.  Of the district councils, the Lib Dems have majorities in Hinckley and Bosworth, and Oadby and Wigston, and they lead a traffic-light coalition in Harborough; the Conservatives have majority control of Blaby and lead a coalition in North West Leicestershire which includes Lib Dem and independent councillors; while Labour run Charnwood as a minority and lead Melton district in coalition with independent councillors.
</p><p>
Two district by-elections also take place in Leicestershire.  In December 2023 we were in Blaby's <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/imny">Glen Parva</a> ward, on the southern edge of Leicester's built-up area, following the resignation of Lib Dem councillor Geoff Welsh on health grounds.  His wife Bev Welsh has now also taken the opportunity to leave the stage to care for her husband, forcing another by-election in a safe Lib Dem ward.  This is defended for the party by Yashmeet Bhamra, who takes on the Conservatives' Shane Blackwell, Labour's Anna Parrish, the Greens' Eleanor Turner and Reform UK's John Bloxham.  In Melton district independent councillor Alan Hewson has resigned his seat in the very rural <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/iy7g">Croxton Kerrial</a> ward, which lies between Melton Mowbray and Grantham and includes the stately home of Belvoir Castle.  As in 2019 and 2023, this ward is a straight fight: NHS worker Max Clift has been nominated an an independent candidate, and she will take on the Conservatives' Elaine Holmes.
</p><p>

</p><p>
Northamptonshire was reorganised in 2020 into two new large councils, with four districts merging to create <b>North Northamptonshire</b>.  Despite the name, this covers the east of the county including Corby, Kettering and Wellingborough.  In 2021 the Conservatives won 60 seats here against 14 Labour, 3 Greens and one independent.  By-elections since then saw the Conservatives lose seats to the Lib Dems in Oundle in February 2022 and to Labour in Kettering's Northall ward in February 2023; the Lib Dem councillor subsequently resigned shortly before the end of his term and his seat has not been filled, while there is also an unfilled vacancy in Corby's Oakley ward after a Labour councillor was thrown off for non-attendance.  The Conservatives could be in for a rough ride here if the 2024 election results are replicated: in the May 2024 Northamptonshire PCC elections Labour were top with 42% against 37% for the Conservatives and 22% for the Lib Dems, while Labour now hold the three parliamentary seats based on this area (including Wellingborough, which was gained in a February 2024 by-election).
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/w-northants21s.svgz" alt="W Northants, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
The larger <b>West Northamptonshire</b> district looks like it could be a closer contest.  In 2021 this returned 66 Conservatives against 20 Labour councillors, 5 Lib Dems and 2 independents.  Again, Labour carried this district in the 2024 Northamptonshire PCC election although more narrowly than in North Northamptonshire: vote shares were 37% for Labour, 35% for the Conservatives and 28% for the Lib Dems.  The four parliamentary seats based on this area are evenly split between two Labour MPs for Northampton and two Conservative MPs for the rural area around it.  Those elections came shortly after the former Conservative council leader, Jonathan Nunn, was forced to resign the leadership over domestic abuse and assault allegations; ultimately no charges were brought, but Nunn was not readmitted to the Conservative whip and he is standing down at this election.
</p><p>
There are no elections this year in the cities of Derby, Leicester or Nottingham or in England's "smallest" "county", Rutland.

</p><p>
We enter the West Midlands by way of <b>Warwickshire</b> county council, which in 2021 elected 42 Conservative councillors against 6 Labour, 5 Lib Dems, 3 Greens and one councillor for the Whitnash Residents Association.  This looks like a large majority, but the 2024 PCC election here was a photofinish with the Conservatives holding on by just 261 votes across the county; shares of the vote were 39.4% for the Conservatives, 39.2% for Labour and 21% for the Lib Dems.  Labour now hold four of Warwickshire's six MPs, against one Conservative (in Kenilworth and Southam) and one Lib Dem (in Stratford-on-Avon).  And this reflects what's happening in the district councils, where Stratford-on-Avon has a Lib Dem majority and the rest are hung: Warwick is under Green Party leadership, Rugby has a minority Labour administration, a defection to the Conservatives has recently cost Labour their majority in Nuneaton and Bedworth, and the Conservatives run North Warwickshire as a minority with 17 seats out of 35.
</p><p>
Well, technically that's 17 seats out of 33 at the moment because two Labour seats are vacant; that has brought the Labour group down to 11, with 5 independent councillors holding the balance of power.  If the Conservatives can gain either of the two by-elections today that will give them an overall majority in North Warwickshire.
</p><p>
Both outgoing Labour councillors here have been elected to Parliament.  Rachel Taylor, who now represents the entire district as MP for North Warwickshire and Bedworth, has vacated her seat in <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i29f">Atherstone Central</a> ward: this looks safe Labour based on the 2023 result, but it was won by the Conservatives in a May 2021 by-election.  The defending Labour candidate Dawn Wilkinson, who is an Atherstone town councillor, takes on the Conservatives' Tony Clews, Reform UK's Steven Watson and the Greens' Joshua Wickham-Young.
</p><p>
Similar comments apply to <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i19f">Arley and Whitacre</a> ward, which covers a rural area west of Nuneaton and north of Coventry: it includes the site of Daw Mill Colliery, which was one of England's last deep coal mines when a fire forced its closure in 2013.  Despite this, Arley and Whitacre ward has trended to the left over the last decade: it returned a full slate of Conservative councillors in 2015, but Labour gained one seat in a September 2016 by-election, a second in 2019 and the last Conservative seat in 2023.  There is a clear personal vote here for the 2016 by-election winner Jodie Gosling, who has left the council after being elected last year as the Labour MP for Nuneaton.  Labour will be hoping that this can transfer to Elinor Parsons, who lectures in drama at De Montfort University; she contested the neighbouring Hartshill ward in 2023 and in a July 2022 by-election, on both occasions without success.  Parsons is up against Neil Pointon for the Conservatives, Peter Downes for the Heritage Party, Susan Guilmant for Reform UK and independent candidate Carolyn McKay, who is an Arley parish councillor.
</p><p>
Another new Warwickshire Labour MP is Rugby's John Slinger, who has left behind his previous Rugby council seat in <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i7nn">New Bilton</a> ward.  This is a working-class area to the west of Rugby town centre which tends to safely return the Labour candidate without fuss.  Angela Thompson defends this seat against competition from JP Downes for the Conservatives, Becca Stevenson for the Green Party, Rebecca Moran for the Lib Dems and Dan Glover for Reform UK.
</p><p>
Yet another new Warwickshire MP is the Lib Dems' Manuela Perteghella, who previously featured in this column in March 2020 when she won a by-election to Stratford-on-Avon council just before COVID lockdown hit.  Rather to the surprise of this column, it has to be said.  Perteghella was subsequently re-elected in 2023 with a large majority as the councillor for <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/ixey">Welford-on-Avon</a> ward, which covers a number of villages to the south-west of Stratford-upon-Avon, and in July 2024 she became the first Liberal Democrat MP for Stratford-on-Avon.  She has now resigned her council seat and she is hoping to pass that large majority on to new Lib Dem candidate Cliff Brown; although the Conservatives' Christian Reeve, Labour's John Hartigan, the Greens' Penny Stott and Reform UK's Neil Lawrence might have something to say about that.
</p><p>
Elswhere in Stratford-on-Avon district the Lib Dems may be given a tougher fight in <a href="andrewteale.me.uk/ixdy">Alcester West</a>, which covers the majority of the town of Alcester, following the resignation of Joseph Harmer.  This ward had significant votes for all three of the main Westminster parties in 2023, so defending Lib Dem candidate Tom Ballinger has some work to do.  Labour's runner-up from 2023 Andrew Foster is trying again, and also standing are Emma Daniell for the Conservatives, John Stott for the Green Party and Ashley Jones for Reform UK.  Hopefully the election material from the candidates will promise better times ahead, on the grounds that Alcester has suffered enough.

</p><p>
<b>Staffordshire</b> county council has been under Conservative control since 2009.  It is perfectly capable of giving lopsided results, as we can see from the 2021 election (57 Conservatives against 4 Labour councillors and one independent), but that doesn't mean Labour are entirely out of this (or Reform UK, if they can capitalise on their current support).  The 2021 Staffordshire PCC election ended in quite a close result, and even once Stoke-on-Trent is taken out of the equation the Conservative lead over Labour was only five points (47-42).  Then in July 2024 Labour went on to win a clear majority of Staffordshire's parliamentary seats: the Tories held only Staffordshire Moorlands; Stone, Great Wyrley and Penkridge; and Kingswinford and South Staffordshire which also includes wards from Dudley.  At district council level, Labour have overall control of Cannock Chase, East Staffordshire and Tamworth and run Staffordshire Moorlands as a minority; the Conservatives have majorities in Newcastle-under-Lyme and South Staffordshire and minority control of Lichfield; and Stafford is run by a Labour-led coalition.
</p><p>
Two new Labour MPs have resigned their previous district council seats.  Last year Dave Robertson became the Labour MP for Lichfield by unseating Michael Fabricant, who has had to resort to <em>Celebrity Big Brother</em> to make ends meet after losing his Parliamentary salary.  Robertson has vacated <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i2hs">Curborough</a> ward, which previously featured in this column in July 2018 and is the northern of the six wards covering Lichfield city; he was first elected in 2019, gaining his seat from the Conservatives, and the ward now looks safe for Labour based on the 2023 result.  The new Labour candidate is Liz Stamatelatos (now say that ten times fast) who takes on the Conservatives' Daniel Floyd who was runner-up here in 2019 and 2023 and new candidates Paul McDermott for the Lib Dems, David Melhuish for the Greens and Matthew Wallens for Reform UK.
</p><p>
Also making the step up from the town hall to the Commons is the new Cannock Chase MP Josh Newbury, whose departure from Cannock Chase council forces a by-election in <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/igjz">Norton Canes</a> ward.  This isn't just the motorway service area on the M6 Toll road, there is a village of that name as well.  Norton Canes ward normally votes Labour but is capable of returning Conservative councillors in a good year; 2024 (when the current ward boundaries were introduced) was not a good year, and the Labour slate was returned very comfortably.  This by-election to replace Newbury is a straight fight between the defending Labour candidate Timothy Frondigoun (a housing professional) and the Conservatives' Samantha Thompson (the outgoing county councillor for Cannock Villages division, which includes this ward).
</p><p>
</p><p>
In Newcastle-under-Lyme we have another trip to <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/irbu">Knutton</a> ward, a village north-west of Newcastle town centre which previously featured in this column in November 2021 and September 2023.  On the first occasion Andrew's Previews made a very rare explicit prediction that the Conservatives would overturn a 75-25 Labour majority; and Tory candidate Derrick Huckfield did, by eight votes in a straight fight.  Huckfield subsequently lost to Labour in the 2022 ordinary election and the 2023 by-election, and he is not trying again this time following the resignation of the 2023 by-election winner Robert Moss.  The Labour candidate Bailey Dickin, who graduated last year from Keele University with a degree in media and sociology, is on the staff of Newcastle-under-Lyme's Labour MP Adam Jogee; he's up against the Conservatives' Finn Swain and Reform UK's Lynn Dean.  Readers with long memories will recall that Newcastle-under-Lyme was one of the first areas to give serious scores to UKIP in local elections, and the aforementioned Derrick Huckfield won the Knutton area several times as a UKIP candidate at both district and county level.
</p><p>
The Newcastle-under-Lyme borough also includes a rural tail to the south-west, and it's here we find <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/isbu">Loggerheads</a> ward on the road towards Market Drayton; indeed, Market Drayton, despite lying over the county boundary in Shropshire, is probably the most convenient town for this ward.  Here we have a by-election to replace last year's mayor of Newcastle, Barry Panter, who died in February at the age of 75 as the result of a car crash.  Panter represented a safe Conservative ward which he should easily pass on to the defending candidate Andrew Turnock, a solicitor; Turnock is opposed only by Labour candidate Jeff Love, who gives an address over the border in Market Drayton.

Which brings us naturally to <b>Shropshire</b> council, which has been continuously Conservative-controlled since its conversion to a unitary council in 2009.  The 2021 elections here returned 43 Conservative councillors, 14 Lib Dems, 9 Labour, 4 Greens and 4 independents; since then the Conservatives have had to defend four seats in by-elections, including some normally very safe wards in the Bridgnorth area, and they lost them all.  None of the Lib Dem councillors were elected on that ticket for wards in the North Shropshire constituency, which was gained by the Liberal Democrats at a by-election in December 2021 and held with a massive majority in 2024; that general election also saw the Conservatives lose the Shrewsbury constituency to Labour.  The Conservatives did carry the Shropshire council area in the 2024 West Mercia PCC election, but with a very unimpressive vote share of 32% against 26% for Labour, 23% for the Lib Dems and 12% for the English Democrats.  No overall control could well be on the cards here.
</p><p>

</p><p>
The largest of the three counties which make up the West Mercia police area is <b>Worcestershire</b>, where there are no local by-elections to compete for attention with the county council contest.  This was a big Conservative win on 2021 with 45 seats against 4 Lib Dems, 3 Labour, 3 Greens and 2 independents; by-elections since then have seen a Labour gain from Conservative (Arrow Valley West, September 2022), a Green Party gain from the Lib Dems (Malvern Chase, May 2023) and a Green Party gain from the Conservatives (Warndon Parish, October 2023).  The Conservatives also have majorities in Wychavon and Wyre Forest and run Bromsgrove in coalition with independent councillors; on the opposition side, Redditch council has a Labour majority, Worcester is run by Labour as a minority while an independent-led coalition controls Malvern Hills council.
</p><p>
The Conservative held up better in Worcestershire than in some other areas in 2024.  Across the county, the 2024 West Mercia PCC votes were 36% for the Conservatives, 29% for Labour, 14% for the Lib Dems and 11% for the Greens.  Worcestershire's six parliamentary seats split four to the Conservatives and two (Redditch and Worcester) to Labour.  Redditch and Worcester do have a lot of Conservative seats between them - the Tories won all eight seats in Redditch in 2021 - but that wouldn't be enough to tip the council into No Overall Control.
</p><p>
One interesting subplot comes in the Conservative-held Bedwardine division in south-western Worcester, where two former Conservative MPs have been nominated - neither of them for the Conservative Party.  The outgoing Conservative county councillor Alan Amos, who was MP for Hexham from 1987 to 1992 and has had a long and winding political journey since then, is seeking re-election as a Reform UK candidate; while the Lib Dem candidate Stephen Dorrell was previously a Conservative MP in Leicestershire from 1979 to 2015 and served in Cabinet for the final three years of the Major government.  Also standing in Bedwardine are Chris Rimell for the Conservatives, Matt Lamb for Labour and Martin Jones for the Greens on an all-male ballot paper.
</p><p>
There are no local elections this year in the West Midlands metropolitan county, Herefordshire, Stoke-on-Trent, or Telford and Wrekin.

<h2>Wales</h2>
</p><p>
We can deal with Wales very quickly as only one by-election is taking place there today.  This is in the Bridgend council ward of <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/ik0w">Pyle, Kenfig Hill and Cefn Cribwr</a>, which lies to the west of Bridgend town north of the M4 motorway.  This ward is divided between the Bridgend constituency and a different constituency at both Westminster and Senedd level.  To be more specific, the Senedd lines place Pyle and Kenfig Hill within the Bridgend constiteuncy while Cefn Cribwr is included within Ogmore - but the Westminster lines place Cefn Cribwr within the Bridgend constituency while Pyle and Kenfig Hill are part of Aberafan Maesteg.  So we have a constituency boundary where both sides of the line are in Bridgend but for different purposes, which of course isn't confusing at all.  This will be only a temporary state of affairs, which the forthcoming Senedd electoral reform will sort out when it comes into force next year.
</p><p>
Anyway, Pyle, Kenfig Hill and Cefn Cribwr was a safe Labour ward when it was created in 2022, as were the two predecessor wards of Cefn Cribwr and Pyle.  Despite this there is a lot of interest in this vacancy following the resignation of Mike Kearn with six candidates standing.  The defending Labour candidate Gary Chappell is chairman of Pyle community council and works as a financial director.  He is up against independent candidate Rhys Watkins who was runner-up here in 2022 and previously stood in the old Pyle ward for Plaid Cymru; Byron Davies for the Conservatives; Owain Clatworthy for Reform UK; Debra Cooper for the Greens; and Andy Moss for Plaid Cymru.

</p><p>
We now come to a county where the only remaining Conservative leadership in local government is the county council.  And the Conservative majority on <b>Gloucestershire</b> county council is small: the 2021 elections returned 28 Conservative councillors against 16 Lib Dems, 5 Labour and 4 Greens.  Just two net losses and the Conservative majority is gone.  Of Gloucestershire's six district councils, Cheltenham and Cotswold have Liberal Democrat majorities; the Lib Dems run Gloucester as a minority and Tewkesbury at the head of a coalition; while both Stroud and the Forest of Dean have minority Green Party administrations.
</p><p>
There was no Green candidate in the 2024 Gloucestershire PCC election, which the Lib Dems came very close to winning: vote shares were 33% for the Conservatives, 32% for the Lib Dems (whose candidate Martin Surl had previously served as an independent PCC) and 24% for Labour.  Gloucestershire's parliamentary seats are now split three for Labour, two-and-a-half for the Lib Dems (the South Cotswolds seat straddles the boundary with Wiltshire), and just one (North Cotswolds) for the Conservatives.  All this would suggest that the Conservative administration in Gloucestershire is in quite a lot of trouble.
</p><p>
There are quite a lot of by-elections here.  We'll start with two in the Forest of Dean, one of which is to replace the seat's new Labour MP Matt Bishop.  He has vacated his council seat in the urban and compact <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/insu">Cinderford East</a> ward, right in the middle of the Forest.  There was a by-election here in May 2021 which Labour held, and this was a very safe Labour ward in 2023, but there has been a rather rapid turnover of councillors here in recent years.  Defending Labour candidate Emma Phillips is challenged by the Conservatives' Paemla Plummer, independent candidate Jeremy Charlton-Wright who finished in fourth place here in 2023, independent candidate Thom Forester who appears to want the Forest of Dean district to annex Ross-on-Wye from Herefordshire, and Stuart Graham for Reform UK.  Interestingly there is no candidate here from the Green Party, who run the district.
</p><p>
At the north end of the Forest we travel to <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/izsu">Newent and Taynton</a> ward, which featured in this column in June 2019 after the death of a Green Party candidate forced the 2019 local election in this ward to be postponed.  In 2023 Newent and Taynton returned an independent councillor and two Lib Dem councillors with a large majority over everyone else (including the third Lib Dem candidate, who was a long way behind his running-mates).  A recent defection means that the Lib Dems need to hold this by-election to retain group status on Forest of Dean council; their candidate Tony Clifford-Winters, who is a Newent town coucnillor, is challenged by the 2023 runner-up Jonathan Beeston for the Conservatives, Graham Mountcastle for Labour and Tim Rickard for the Green Party.
</p><p>
In Tewkesbury district the Liberal Democrats have a by-election to defend in <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/igpu">Innsworth</a> ward, which covers two parishes on the northern edge of Gloucester which are effectively part of the city but are divided from it by the ring road, plus the separate village of Twigworth to the north.  This was close between the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives in 2023, with the Lib Dem holding one seat and gaining the other from Cosnervative ward councillor Graham Bocking.  Unfortunately we have an entry here for the Councillors Behaving Badly file, because last month the outgoing Lib Dem councillor Paul Ockelton was sent to prison for 18 months and placed on the sex offenders' register for ten years for sexually assaulting a child.  A bizarre candidate list for this by-election sees both defeated Conservative candidates from 2023 stand again, but Rojina Pradhan Rai is now the defending Liberal Democrat candidate while former Conservative ward councillor Graham Bocking is standing this time for Reform UK.  This has left intending Conservative voters without a candidate of their own, as Labour's Veronica Davies and the Greens' Jonathan Bristow complete the ballot.
</p><p>
The Liberal Democrats should be on safer ground in <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i91y">Charlton Kings</a> ward at the south-eastern corner of Cheltenham, which is a local government district where they are dominant.  Hannah Healy will be seeking to defending this seat following the resignation of Andy Mutton; her challengers are Matt Babbage for the Conservatives, Karen Wilson for the Greens and Malcolm Bride for Labour.
</p><p>
In Cotswold district we come to <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i2qr">Tetbury with Upton</a> ward, which surrounds the town of Tetbury on three sides and includes King Charles' country estate at Highgrove.  (The Bristol <em>Evening Post</em> once covered the news of Charles and Camilla's engagement with the headline "Tetbury man to wed".)   Here we have to consider the bizarre local government career of Chris Twells, who was first elected in 2022 as a Liberal Democrat councillor for Ordsall ward in inner-city Salford.  In 2023 Twells then won a second seat by gaining the Tetbury with Upton ward in Cotswold district from the Conservatives.  You will note that this is quite a long way away from Salford, and the Lib Dems had a bit of a sense-of-humour failure over this double-hatting and suspended his party membership.  Twells relinquished his Salford council seat in 2024 and stood for Parliament shortly afterwards as the continuing Liberal Party candidate for South Cotswolds: he got nowhere.  He has now resigned his Cotswold council seat; as to what Twells is doing now ... well, we'll come to that later.  In the meantime Pauline Foster - who is described as a successful businesswoman - is seeking to hold the seat as a more conventional Lib Dem candidate against challenges from the Conservatives' Laura Hall-Wilson (a freelance consultant and small businesswoman), Michael Wagner of the Green Party, Josh Littler-Jennings for Labour and Elizabeth Nagle of Reform UK.
</p><p>
Eleshwere in Cotswold district, the Lib Dems should have an easier time in <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i6qr">Watermoor</a> ward in Cirencester, where Gary Selwyn is retiring after six years in office on the grounds that he's just got his pension.  This was a very safe Lib Dem ward in 2023, and town councillor Nick Bridges should have little trouble defending this seat for the Lib Dems against competition from the Conservatives' McKenzie Fuller, the Greens' Tony Cima, Labour's Andy Farmer and Reform UK's Lisa Marsden.
</p><p>
Our final Gloucestershire by-election comes in the centre of Stroud, where former Stroud Labour MP David Drew has resigned both his county and district council seats: it appears that the local Labour party had deselected him for this year's county elections and Drew fell out with the party over that.  He had gained his district council seat in <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/itgr">Stroud Central</a> ward from the Green Party in 2024, and rather narrowly so, so this could be a difficult defence for Labour's Shelley Rider who is a Nailsworth town councillor.  The Greens' Cate James-Hodges, who was runner-up here last time, is back for another go; while Hena Mannan-Rahman of the Conservaties, Lucian Aeris of UKIP, Philip Purves of the Lib Dems and Daryl Smith of Reform UK start from further back.
</p><p>
The main order of business in the South West region is the third <b>West of Englamd</b> mayoral election, which covers three boroughs in CUBA, the County which Used to Be Avon: the city of Bristol, Bath and North East Somerset, and South Gloucestershire.  In 2021 this was gained by Labour candidate Dan Norris, a former Labour MP for the now-abolished Wansdyke constituency: first-preference shares were 33% for Labour, 29% for the Conservatives, 22% for the Greens and 16% for the Lib Dems, with Norris going on to win the run-off against the Conservatives by 60-40.
</p><p>
The Conservatives are now completely shut out of power in this area.  Of the three local authorities, Bath and North East Somerset has a Liberal Democrat majority, South Gloucestershire has a Lib Dem and Labour coalition, and Bristol has a Green and Lib Dem coalition.  All the parliamentary seats for this area are held by Labour, the Liberal Democrats or (in the case of Bristol Central) the Green Party, and outgoing mayor Norris himself is now back in Parliament after defeating Sir Jacob Ress-Mogg to become MP for North East Somerset and Hanham.  The candidate list for this election had already confirmed that Norris was not seeking relection as West of England mayor when he was arrested last month on suspicion of very serious offences, and he lost the Labour whip as a result.
</p><p>
The West of England election looks very open thanks to the low share of the vote it was won on last time.  Defending the position for Labour is Helen Godwin, who is a former Bristol city councillor who represented Southmead ward from 2016 to 2021 and who served in the cabinet of Bristol's former elected mayor Marvin Rees.  The Conservative candidate Steve Smith was previously a Bristol city councillor from a 2018 by-election to 2024, representing Westbury-on-Trym and Henleaze ward, and he was lord mayor of Bristol in 2021-22.  Following a late withdrawal the Green candidate is Mary Page, who led the successful referendum campaign to scrap Bristol's elected mayor.  Standing for the Lib Dems is Oli Henman, a Bath and North East Somerset councillor.  We have a longer ballot paper than last time, with businessman Arron Banks standing for Reform UK and an independent candidacy from South Gloucestershire Labour councillor Ian Scott, who went for the Labour nomination and didn't get it.
</p><p>

</p><p>
Moving east we come to the unitary <b>Wiltshire</b> council, which has a large Conservative majority: the 2021 elections returned 61 Conservatives against 27 Lib Dems, 7 independents and 3 Labour councillors.  By-elections since then have seen the Liberal Democrats gain two seats from the Conservatives, in Salisbury and Calne.  The 2024 Wiltshire PCC elections had a fragmented result, with the Wiltshire council area giving 34% to the Conservatives, 27% to an independent candidates, 23% to the Liberal Democrats and 16% to Labour.  In the general election the Wiltshire council area's seats split three to the Conservatives and two-and-a-half to the Lib Dems.  The Liberal Democrats will certainly be looking for gains at this election.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/devon21s.svgz" alt="Devon CC, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Similar comments apply to <b>Devon</b> county council, where the 2021 result was 39 Conservative councillors against 9 Lib Dems, 7 Labour (all from Exeter), 3 independents and 2 Greens.  There have been no county council by-elections in this term, but a lot of water has flowed under the bridge nonetheless.  Of Devon's eight district councils, four now have Liberal Democrat majorities; Exeter has a Labour majority; Torridge is run by independent councillors; and East Devon and West Devon both have rainbow coalitions, under a Lib Dem and an independent leader respectively.
</p><p>
The Conservatives did do relatively well here in the 2024 Devon and Cornwall PCC election: vote shares across the Devon county council area were 43% for the Conservatives, 34% for Labour and 23% for the Liberal Democrats.  The Parliamentary and county council boundaries don't match up, but in the 2024 general election the seats predominantly within the Devon county council area split 4½ to the Lib Dems, 4 to the Conservatives and 1 (Exeter) to Labour.
</p><p>
Two of Devon's new Lib Dem MPs have now vacated their district council seats.  Ian Roome, now the MP for North Devon, has resigned his North Devon council seat in Barnstaple with Pilton ward which covers northern Barnstaple.  This is a safe Lib Dem ward and their wonderfully-named defending candidate Loki Dawson shouldn't have too much trouble fending off challenges from Howard Porter of the Green Party, Lisa Mackenzie of the Conservatives, Rhys Jones of Labour and David Jarvis of Reform UK.  Over in the more recent Lib Dem hotspot of Mid Devon, Rachel Gilmour has left Mid Devon council after being elected as MP for the cross-county Tiverton and Minehead seat; this forces a by-election in Clare and Shuttern, a rural ward to the north of Tiverton, where the Lib Dems' Martyn Stratton is favoured against the Conservatives' Toby Gray and Labour's Terry Edwards.
</p><p>
Labour have two city council seats to defend in Exeter.  Mincinglake and Whipton ward has been vacated by Naima Allcock, forcing a tricky by-election in a ward which is normally safe Labour but saw a strong independent challenge last year.  Labour's Paula Black, who works as a teacher, has work to do to fend off independent candidate Angela Martin, Ian Baldwin of the Conservatives, Martin Ayres of the Green Party, Paul Richards of the Liberal Democrats and Tony Payne of Reform UK.
</p><p>
Meanwhile Joshua Ellis-Jones has resigned his Exeter council seat in Topsham ward, which lies at the southern end of the city on the railway line towards Exmouth.  Here the challenge to Labour comes from the Conservatives, who regularly won this ward until 2022 and will want their seats back.  This is likely to be a telling contest between defending Labour candidate James Cookson (who is also standing in the county council election for the faraway division of Newton Abbot North) and the Conservatives' Keith Sparkes, with an all-male ballot paper completed by Greg Wotton for the Greens, Philip Thomas for the Lib Dems and Edward Hill for Reform UK.
</p><p>
In Teignbridge district the Liberal Democrats have to defend Teignmouth West ward, where a big lead in 2023 derives almost entirely from a large personal vote in favour of David Cox who had nearly twice as many votes as his running-mate Nina Jeffries.  Jeffires has resigned from the council, so the Lib Dems will have to do without that personal vote in defending this seat.  Their candidate is Penny Lloyd, a Teignmouth town councillor who is opposed by Joe Dagger for the Conservatives, Colin Baigent for Labour, Ollie Hind for the Greens, Steve Horner for Reform UK and Madeleine Hunt for the Heritage Party.
</p><p>
Finally in Devon it's time for yet another visit to the cursed Tavistock North ward which is having its seventh by-election of this century, and its fourth in as many years.  The 2023 ordinary elextion here returned independent Jeff Moody, Lib Dem Peter Squire and the Green Party's Terry Vincent, who resigned immediately as he had been no-fault evicted by his landlord and could not secure new accommodation in Tavistock.  The resulting by-election in June 2023 resulted in a tie between Lib Dem candidate Holly Greenbury-Pullen and independent candidate Ursula Mann, with Mann winning the drawing of lots and being elected on the returning officer's casting vote.  Squire resigned last year and Greenbury-Pullen held the resulting by-election in May 2024 for the Lib Dems.  We now have a third by-election of the term because Mann has stood down, and this time it is a free-for-all because there is no defending independent candidate.  Candidates here are Graham Reed for the Liberal Democrats, Judy Hughes for the Conservatives, Sara Wood for the Green Party, Uwem Udo for Labour and Brian Trew for Reform UK.  Hughes, Wood and Udo were all unsuccessful candidates in the 2024 by-election.

The Conservatives gained overall control of <b>Cornwall</b> council in 2021, and they have a rather small overall majority with 47 seats against 16 independent councillors, 13 Lib Dems, 5 Labour, 5 Mebyon Kernow and 1 Green.  They have since lost a by-election to the Lib Dems in Long Rock, Marazion and St Erth.  Subsequent elections in 2024 delivered rather contradictory results.  In the May 2024 Devon and Cornwall PCC election Cornwall gave 44% to the Conservatives, 35% to Labour and 21% to the Lib Dems, but two months later the Conservatives lost every seat they were defending here as Cornwall's six parliamentary seats split four to Labour and two to the Liberal Democrats.  Goodness knows what will happen here, although the number of independent candidates appears to be significantly down on recent years.

I promised you above more on the story of Chris Twells, ex-Lib Dem councillor for Salford and Cotswold at the same time.  Well, it would appear that this experience and the negative publicity it generated has not put him off.  Having resigned as Cotswold coucnil seat as noted earlier, Twells has now popped up in Cornwall with a new name of Chris Green, and he
