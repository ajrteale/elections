MAYOR OF HACKNEY, Hackney council; caused by the resignation of Labour mayor Jules Pipe who is joining Sadiq Khan's administration in City Hall as deputy mayor for planning, regeneration and skills.  He had served as mayor of Hackney since the post was established in October 2002, and before then as a Hackney councillor from 1996.

Welcome to inner London for what, in terms of electorate, is comfortably the biggest by-election of 2016.  We're in the London Borough of Hackney, one of the older administrative units in the UK (thanks to our obsession with local government reorganisation) dating from 1965 when the former Hackney, Shoreditch and Stoke Newington councils were merged.  

In Hackney's history Labour have usually been the largest party, and in the first borough elections in 1964 they won all 60 seats.  Unfortunately the next election was the notorious Wilson nadir of 1968, which saw the Tories win overall control of the council with a group of neophytes and paper candidates who then proceeded to do about as well as you'd expect from a group of neophytes and paper candidates.  Labour regained overall control in the 1971 election, but lost control in 1990 as the council entered a rather troubled period.  

Labour regained their majority in 1994, but the party had descended into infighting and the council's finances were in an even worse position, with Hackney having borrowed heavily in the 1960s and 1970s to build tower blocks which subsequently became uninhabitable or were demolished.  The Labour majority disappeared in 1996 with two by-election losses to the Lib Dems in Wick and Dalston wards; the Wick by-election winner was Neil Hughes, who now sits on Eden district council in Cumbria but is probably better known as one of the 7 Up children.  
The 1998 election returned hung council, and then Hackney's financial and political crisis came to a head.  By this time a breakaway Labour group had taken control, and the administration was in a mess: as well as the council's debts, a failed social security outsourcing contract had cost the council £36 million, and £100,000 was lost with the collapse of Railtrack in which the council had invested part of its pension fund.  A damning OFSTED report in 1999 led to central government investigating the council's finances and effectively taking control of its expenditure.  The political crisis eventually led to a coalition agreement between the moderate Labour group leader, Jules Pipe, and the Conservative group leader, Eric Ollerenshaw (who would later lead the Tory group on the London Assembly and serve one term as MP for Lancaster), in which Pipe and Ollerenshaw became joint leaders of the council.  By the 2002 elections they had managed to stabilise the borough's finances (at the cost of forcing worse pay and conditions on the council's staff which led to a small fortune being paid out in unfair dismissal claims).

Somehow from all this chaos normality returned to the borough very swiftly.  The 2002 elections returned a large, and this time unified, Labour majority which has not been seriously challenged since.  On the same day a referendum on the establishment of an elected mayor for the borough resulted in a 70% Yes vote, and in October 2002 Pipe rose from the council leadership to win the borough's inaugural Mayoral election.  He has held the post ever since, and has been appointed CBE for his political service.

As this is only the fourth by-election to a UK elected mayor post it's worth looking at the previous three to see if there are any straws in the wind:

(1) North Tyneside, June 2003: Tory mayor resigned after being arrested on suspicion of possessing indecent images of children (he was subsequently exonerated).  Tory hold with an increased majority.

(2) Bedford, October 2009: independent ("Better Bedford Party") mayor died.  Lib Dem gain.

(3) Tower Hamlets, June 2015: independent ("Tower Hamlets First") mayor was disqualified for electoral fraud.  Labour gain.

Although two of the three previous mayoral by-elections resulted in gains, and all three went to a run-off, neither of those events look likely to happen in a Hackney context.  Pipe was taken to a run-off in the 2002 and 2006 elections by the Tory candidate (Andrew Boff in both cases) but his majority in 2014 when he beat the Greens 60-18 in the first round suggests Labour should have little trouble holding this by-election.  In the simultaneous Hackney council election Labour outpolled the Greens 56-21 in terms of votes; a poor Green vote distribution means that the Greens' 21% of the vote turns into no seats at all on Hackney council, with Labour's 50 councillors opposed by four Conservatives (whose vote is concentrated in Stamford Hill were there is a large Jewish community) and three Lib Dems.  If anything, Labour did better in the London Assembly elections in May: Sadiq Khan beat Zac Goldsmith across the borough 67-12, and in the London Members ballot Labour beat the Greens 59-15 - unlike most of the GLA election results quoted by this column, these figures include postal votes (for which ward breakdowns are not available).  The following month Hackney voted 78% Remain in the EU referendum.

As the references to run-offs indicate, this by-election will be held using the Supplementary Vote system in which voters should give a first and second preference.  A win in the first round requires 50% of the first-preference votes; if this is not achieved the top two candidates will go forward to the run-off and the votes for the other three candidates will be transferred to their second-preference candidate.

It should be noted that Hackney has a history of cockups in administering its mayoral elections: in 2010 the electoral address for the Tory candidate (Andrew Boff, again) was held up so long by legal argument over whether it was admissible that it missed the print deadline for the official candidate statements' booklet; this time round a printing error (thought to be describing the Tory candidate as a "Conversative") has led to all the postal ballot papers for this election having to be reprinted and the postal votes consequently went out four days late.  Hopefully this will not have any significant effect on the election.

There are some famous names in the roll-call of previous Hackney by-election candidates: as well as Ollerenshaw and Hughes already mentioned we can add the former Home Secretary Charles Clarke (Chatham ward, October 1980) and Pipe himself (South Defoe ward, November 1996), while the campaigning journalist Paul Foot finished third in Hackney's first mayoral election as the Socialist Alliance candidate.  Hoping to follow in Pipe's footsteps is Labour candidate Philip Glanville, a Hackney councillor since 2006 (for Hoxton West ward since 2014 and Hoxton ward before then) who was Pipe's deputy mayor and so has already taken over the mayoral functions on an acting basis.  He is opposed by Green candidate Samir Jeraj, a journalist and officer for the Race Equality Foundation; Amy Gray for the Tories; Dave Raval for the Lib Dems; and Dawa Ma who is the other member of the One Love Party which finished last in May's London mayoral election, both in this borough and across London.

PUCKERIDGE, East Hertfordshire council; caused by the resignation of former Conservative councillor James Cartwright following a Twitter row in which he insulted three users who disagreed with him that prayers should be held before full council meetings; after being censured by the council and ordered to attend social media training, he left the Conservative party.  Cartwright had served since 2015.

From Hackney we travel north along what was once Ermine Street and is now the A10.  Puckeridge was established by the Romans as "Ad Fines" at the junction of Ermine Street with Stane Street.  The modern village's economy was once based on coaching - it was on the main route between London and Cambridge - but today it functions as a dormitory settlement for Hertford, the Lea Valley towns and London.

East Hertfordshire returned a full slate of Tory district councillors in 2015, and Puckeridge ward is not seriously challenged by other parties.  In the 2015 election Cartwright beat Labour 68-20.  The Tories are similarly safe in the local Hertfordshire county division (Braughing).

The Tories will be hoping to put behind them the row over prayers at council meetings which has now cost them two East Hertfordshire councillors - the motion's proposer resigned last year and the resulting by-election featured a spectacular cockup by the Tory agent which led to the Conservative candidate appearing on the ballot paper without a description.  She was nonetheless elected.  This time the Tories have correctly nominated Peter Boylan, a Braughing parish councillor and author.  Labour have reselected their regular candidate for the ward David Bell, who is campaigning for a bypass for Puckeridge.  Also on an unusually long ballot paper for the ward are Tabitha Evans for the Green Party, Sara Mihajlovic for the Lib Dems and Geoffrey Miles for UKIP.

TUPTON, North East Derbyshire council; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Wayne Lilleyman after an assault at Tupton Miners' Welfare in which he bit an 18-year-old man on the nose; he received a police caution.  He had served since 2011.

We move to another settlement on a Roman road, in this case Ryknield Street.  Tupton ward covers two villages (Old Tupton and New Tupton) off the A61 Chesterfield-Alfreton road together with a small part of Wingerworth to the north.  The village is probably best known for Tupton Hall school, which educated Dennis Skinner (at a time when it was a grammar school), and as the home of John Lowe, three-time darts world champion and the first player to shoot a televised nine-dart finish.

Tupton is part of the North East Derbyshire constituency, which now looks marginal at parliamentary level because of the Sheffield and Chesterfield suburbs contained within it, but is historically a Labour mining seat.  This is one of the Labour areas: Labour were unopposed here in the 2003 election but one of the Labour councillors was re-elected in 2007 as an independent, bringing a running-mate with him.  Labour got the seats back in 2011 and in the 2015 election beat the Conservatives 67-33 in a straight fight.  The local county division (Clay Cross North) is also safe for Labour.

Even in the dubious circumstances of this by-election Labour should have little trouble holding this seat.  Their candidate is Cathy Goodyer, chairman of Tupton parish council.  The Tories have reselected Andrew Lovell who was their lead candidate last year.  Also standing are Alan Garfitt for UKIP, David Hancock for the Lib Dems and Ben Marshall for the British People's Party - not the neo-Nazi party of that name (which dissolved in 2013) but a group of cranks which has taken the name over without considering the implications.

BISHOP'S CASTLE, Shropshire council; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Charlotte Barnes for personal and family reasons.  She had served since winning a by-election in September 2011.

Anybody who knows the Marches knows that it specialises in market towns which are beautiful, tiny and remote.  One of these is Bishop's Castle; generally pronounced by locals in a way that's difficult to reconcile with the English alphabet, "the Castle", despite its tiny population, was a full-blown borough before the 1974 local government reorganisation.  These days it anchors a ward including eleven other tiny parishes in the Onny and Kemp valleys, the largest of which is Lydbury North; within the boundary is part of that strange and beautiful upland plateau called the Long Mynd.

This combination of the bohemian Castle and remote agricultural villages is a classic area for old-school Liberalism (it borders Montgomeryshire which was a Liberal seat for many years until Lembit Öpik got his hands on it) and in 2009 narrowly returned old-school Liberal Peter Phillips who had represented the area for many years on the pre-reorganisation South Shropshire council.  Phillips resigned in 2011 and was replaced by Barnes who increased the Lib Dem majority; at the last poll here in 2013 the Lib Dems beat the Tories 62-31.

Defending for the Lib Dems is Jonny Keeley, a musician (with the local band Fight the Bear) and community campaigner who runs a website promoting local organisations.  The Tory candidate is Georgie Ellis, runner-up here in 2009, a former South Shropshire councillor for the area and Lydbury North parish councillor.  Also standing are Steve Hale for the Green Party and Judith Payne for Labour.  Some of the electors for this by-election will be thrilled to hear that their polling station is a pub - the Inn on the Green in Wentnor.

CASTLE, Carlisle council, Cumbria; caused by the death of Labour councillor Gerald Caig at the age of 64.  A GMB union official originally from Cleator Moor in west Cumbria, Caig was first elected to Carlisle council in 2014; he was the father of Tony Caig, former Carlisle United goalkeeper and now goalkeeping coach with Hartlepool United.

From Bishop's Castle we travel north to a historic castle.  Back in December 1745 Carlisle Castle was the scene of the last siege in England, in which the army of the Crown reduced the last garrison left in England by Bonnie Prince Charlie's forces as they retreated north.  The castle itself was built in the eleventh century by William II and rebuilt in stone by his successor Henry I to guard the border city of Carlisle; although England and Scotland are now at peace the Army are still here with the Duke of Lancaster's regiment being headquartered in the castle, and in 2009 your columnist was here under their auspices as part of the centenary celebrations for the Territorial Army (as it then was).

The ward named after Carlisle Castle falls into two separate parts.  To the west side of the castle and the River Caldew is the Willow Holme and Newtown areas around the Cumberland Infirmary.  To the east side of the castle is Carlisle's historic city centre, all of which is within this ward except for Citadel railway station.  The northern boundary of the ward is the River Eden and much of the north of the ward is flood plain.  The ward includes some Cumbria University buildings.  Until 2013 it had the same boundaries as the Castle division of Cumbria county council, and county results up to 2013 are included in the table below.

Located within this ward is the "Cursing Stone", placed in 2001 in a pedestrian subway near the Tullie House museum and inscribed with a 1,069-word curse placed on the border reivers in 1525 by Gavin Dunbar, archbishop of Glasgow.  Instead it appears to have cursed Carlisle itself: Cumberland's farms were devastated by the foot-and-mouth outbreak of 2001; the city was hit by devastating floods in 2005 and 2015, the most recent of which flooded the McVitie's factory and led to a national biscuit shortage; a series of crimes; hits to the local economy; even Carlisle United's relegation from the football league in 2004 were all blamed on the Cursing Stone.  In 2005 the ward's city and county councillor Jim Tootle proposed that the stone be removed or destroyed, but the city council voted to keep it.  Seven years later Tootle was dead at the age of 59, and two years after that the winner of the by-election to replace Tootle on Cumbria county council was dead at the age of 67.  In fact, this is Castle's eighth by-election (either at city or county level) in the fifteen years since the Cursing Stone was installed, a very high councillor attrition rate.  Coincidence?

Your columnist's other reader has been in touch pointing out that in recent weeks a preview along the lines of "this ward used to be Labour versus Lib Dem but now it's Labour versus somebody else" has often been followed by a spectacular Lib Dem gain.  At the risk of tempting fate, that's unlikely to happen here.  While the Lib Dems did win all but one of the elections in this ward from 1999 to 2010 (the exception being an April 2001 by-election), making this Carlisle's only reliable Lib Dem ward at the time, Labour's record from 2011 onwards is eight wins out of a possible eight and the Lib Dems are now in a poor fourth place.  In May Labour had 50% of the vote to 24% for the Conservatives and 14% for UKIP.  Although Labour did very badly in the last Carlisle by-election, held in Botcherby ward in January, that ward already had a successful independent slate competing with Labour and a large proportion of its electors had been flooded out only weeks before.

Defending for Labour is Anne Glendinning, a former city and county councillor for Botcherby ward who tried and failed to get her city council seat back there in May.  The Tory candidate is mother-of-four, health shop manager and WI member Melissa Andrews who in 2014 took part in a half-Ironman triathlon in California for a Channel 5 TV series - with her pink hair, piercings and tattoos, Andrews is probably not what you expected a Tory candidate to look like.  UKIP have reselected their candidate from May Robbie Reid-Sinclair, a founder of the Solway Aviation Museum who is active in the Carlisle branch of the British Legion.  Also standing are Alison Hobson for the Lib Dems (who gives an address in Brampton) and Deborah Brown for the Green Party.

BLAKELAW, Newcastle upon Tyne council, Tyne and Wear; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor David Stockdale, ostensibly due to work commitments although he was later investigated by the council and police over alleged financial irregularities; he has since been exonerated.  First elected in 2012 and re-elected for a second term only in May, he had served as the council's cabinet minister for culture and communities.

For our final preview of the week, and final resignation of the week under what might be called "a cloud", we're in the west end of Newcastle upon Tyne.  Blakelaw is a mostly post-war development located within the A1 Western Bypass; it's a council estate ward and suffers from all the usual problems of council estate wards.

Your columnist's other reader has been in touch pointing out that in recent weeks a preview along the lines of "this ward used to be Labour versus Lib Dem but now it's Labour versus somebody else" has often been followed by a Lib Dem gain.  At the risk of tempting fate, that's only slightly less unlikely to happen here than it is in Carlisle this week.  Blakelaw was one of the wards taken over in the Noughties by the Lib Dems during the time they controlled Newcastle council.  The Lib Dem share of the vote peaked at 52% in 2006, but the coalition took the floor out of their vote here: Labour gained all three seats in the period 2010-2012, and UKIP took over second place in 2015.  This is now a safe Labour ward with the party having a 63-16 lead over UKIP in May.

Defending for Labour is Nora Casey, who came to Newcastle from her native Ireland in 2014 and fought the marginal North Heaton ward in May; this should be a safer berth for her.  UKIP have reselected Ritchie Lane who fought the ward in May.  Also standing are recent University of York graduate Ciaran Morrissey for the Lib Dems, regular Tory candidate James Langley and regular Green candidate Brendan Derham.
