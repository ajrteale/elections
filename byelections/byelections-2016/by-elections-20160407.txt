Three by-elections on 7th April 2016:

POCKLINGTON PROVINCIAL, East Riding council; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Stephen Lane at the age of 67 - or 12, given that he was born on 29th February.  A farmer for more than 30 years, Lane had been an East Riding councillor since 2007, and had served as vice-chairman of the western area planning, and environment and regeneration scrutiny committees.

The East Riding has some peculiarly large wards for such a generally rural area, and some rather wonderfully-named wards of which Pocklington Provincial is perhaps the most baroque.  Pocklington is a market town off the main road from York to Hull, lying at the foot of the Yorkshire Wolds.  Its greatest prosperity came in the early Middle Ages; the Domesday survey found it was the largest settlement in Yorkshire after York, and the town thrived as a trading centre for wool.  The Industrial Revolution passed the town by and Pocklington's economy is now based on agriculture (notably of rapeseed and sugar beet) and commuting to the major Yorkshire cities.  The ward itself contains six other parishes to the west and north-west of the town along the east bank of the Derwent, running as far as Stamford Bridge, a village on the Derwent known for the September 1066 battle in which King Harald Hardrada of Norway was killed and the Viking Age in Britain came to a end.

Since 2003 this sprawling ward has traditionally been a fight between the Conservatives and an independent slate which won two of the ward's three seats in 2003.  The independents lost their seats to the Tories in 2007 and gave up in 2015, when the Tories had 44% to 20% for the Labour slate and 19% for a single UKIP candidate.

Defending for the Conservatives is Paul West, a Pocklington town councillor who was Mayor of Pocklington in 2014-15.  Labour have gone for youth in selecting A-level student Lucie Spadone who, unusually for an S, is top of the ballot paper.  The UKIP candidate is Neil Tate who gives an address thirty miles away in Bridlington, and self-employed painter and decorator Andy Strangeway completes the ballot paper as an independent.

YNYSDDU, Caerphilly county borough council; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Colin Durham, citing work commitments.  He had served on Caerphilly council since 2012.

For the last electoral test in Wales before the fifth Welsh Assembly elections in 2016, we are in the lower Sirhowy Valley between Blackwood and Risca.  Ynysddu itself is an early-nineteenth-century mining village typical of the Valleys, and probably best known as the home town of the singer Ricky Valance.  Also within the division are the villages of Cwmfelinfach, the site of Nine Mile Point colliery which saw South Wales' first sit-in industrial action; the twentieth-century village of Wyllie; and Wattsville which gave its name to a Manic Street Preachers song.  Overlooking the valley is the mountain of Mynyddislwyn which once gave its name to a parish covering the whole area as well as to one of the division's famous sons, the Welsh-language poet "Islwyn" (or William Thomas).

In more modern times Islwyn has given its name to a parliamentary constituency which sent Neil Kinnock to Parliament for many years.  Ynysddu's election results have been more mixed with its two Noughties elections being close fights between Labour and Plaid that saw the parties split the division's two seats.  Labour pulled away in the 2012 election to beat Plaid 61-33, both the outgoing councillors polling well ahead of their running-mates.

Defending for Labour is Wattsville resident Philippa Marsden, a member of the Unite national committee, vice-chair of the Islwyn branch of Labour and chair of Newport Harriers athletics club.  Marina Pritchard, the second Plaid candidate here in 2012, tries again.  Also standing are Matthew Kidner for the Lib Dems and Joe Smyth for UKIP.

ALMOND AND EARN, Perth and Kinross council; caused by the death of Independent councillor Alan Jack at the age of 76.  He had served on Perth and Kinross council since 1999, originally as a Conservative but his final re-election in 2012 was as an independent: that 2012 election was controversial as Jack's campaign went a long way over the election expenses limit, and he was fined £450.

For the last electoral test in Scotland before the fifth Scottish Parliament elections in 2016, we are in southern Perthshire in a large rural ward which sprawls immediately to the west and south of Perth.  This is a ward of no towns; the largest settlement is probably Bridge of Earn, a commuter village to the south of Perth, while the Almond part of the ward includes the village of Methven, an away win for the English in 1306 in the days when England and Scotland faced off on the battlefield rather than the rugby field.

Alan Jack's base was in Bridge of Earn which he had represented (as part of the former Earn ward) since 1999.  The present Almond and Earn ward was formed in 2007 and was based on the former Earn ward and Strathalmond ward (based on Methven and voting SNP in 2003) together with parts of the former wards of Abernethy and Glenfarg (C), Auchterarder Mid Earn (C), and Strathord and Logiealmond (LD).  In the 2007 election to the new ward, the first election held under PR, the Tories tried for two out of three seats and polled 46%, but that was short of two quotas and SNP surplus transfers gave the final seat to the Lib Dems' George Hayton, who had previously been councillor for Kinross Town before being displaced by PR.

In 2012 Alan Jack stood for re-election as an independent, the SNP tried for two seats and the Tories settled for one: the first preferences split 41% to the SNP, 30% for the Tories and just 12% for Jack, but Jack capitalised on some less-than-perfect balancing by the SNP to pick up transfers from everybody else and win the final seat by just 14 votes, defeating the outgoing SNP councillor who lost her seat to her running-mate.

There is no defending independent candidate in this by-election so Alan Jack's seat is up for grabs.  In pole position to pick it up, if the first preferences from 2012 are any guide, is the former SNP councillor Wilma Lumsden who lost her seat in 2012.  The Tory candidate is Kathleen Baird, who previously represented part of this ward as councillor for Abernethy and Glenfarg from 2003; in 2007 she transferred to Kinross-shire ward but lost her seat in 2012.  (The Lib Dem candidate whom Baird defeated in 2003 was Danus Skene, whom readers might recall as the losing SNP candidate in Orkney and Shetland last year, although that wasn't even the strangest aspect of his long electoral career.)  Also standing are Dave Mackenzie for Labour, former councillor George Hayton for the Lib Dems and Denise Baykal of UKIP.
