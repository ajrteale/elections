"All the right votes, but not necessarily in the right order"

There are ten by-elections on 16th November 2017 in England's towns and villages.  There is one Liberal Democrat defence, in Penrith; four Labour defences, two in the Tees Valley towns and two in Suffolk; and five Conservative defences, two in Lincolnshire and one each in Darlington, Lancashire and Buckinghamshire.  With eight of this week's by-elections being in safe wards we shouldn't expect much change, although two of those polls are in the marginal parliamentary seat of Darlington and should therefore be given some attention as to the swing.  We shall come later to the Lib Dem defence, which looks particularly unpredictable; but we start this week with what is clearly the marquee contest.  It's time to go to the far East...

<h2>Kirkley; and<br/>
St Margaret's</h2>

Waveney council, Suffolk; caused respectively by the resignations of husband and wife Stephen Logan and Louisa Harris-Logan, who were Labour councillors.  Both were first elected in 2015, and are resigning due to work commitments.

http://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/waveney-kirkley.png

For the first of our two towns this week with two by-elections we travel to the UK's easternmost town, Lowestoft.  Kirkley ward lies in southern Lowestoft, on the far side of the Bascule Bridge.  Developed in the Victorian era by the railway entrepreneur Sir Samuel Peto, Kirkley still retains many of its period houses, including the birthplace of Benjamin Britten on Kirkley Cliff Road.  (It's a B&B now, in case you fancy staying.)  That old housing stock and seaside location doesn't necessarily translate into a desirable place to live: Kirkley ward includes the most deprived census district in Suffolk and has the county's lowest life expectancy.

http://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/waveney-st-margarets.png

Not much further up the social scale is St Margaret's ward, which covers postwar housing in the north-east corner of the town and has seen some new development in recent years off the town's recently-completed bypass, Millennium Way.

The two wards may look similar from the census but have interestingly different political histories.  Kirkley was traditionally a Labour versus Lib Dem fight, the Liberal Democrats carrying the ward every year from 1999 to 2008, but this was one of the areas where Coalition led to the Lib Dem vote disappearing.  In 2015 Labour led here with 36%, to 21% for the Conservatives, 20% for UKIP and 15% for an independent candidate.

http://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2015/waveney15.png

By contrast, St Margaret's ward has never failed to return a Labour councillor in the 44-year history of Waveney council.  Despite that, for many years now it has been a very tight fight between Labour and the Conservatives: the closest the Tories got to gaining the ward was in 2006 when they were just eight votes behind Labour.  In 2015 Labour again led with 36%, to 30% for the Conservatives and 26% for UKIP.  Those looking for a Conservative gain to offset several Tory losses in recent week's by-elections may take further heart from the fact that Labour performed very badly in Lowestoft in May and June: both St Margaret's and Kirkley are in county divisions which the Conservatives gained in May, and the local parliamentary seat (Waveney) was the only seat which voted Leave in 2016 where the Labour vote fell in June's general election.

Both by-elections have attracted a full field of candidates from all five main parties.  Defending Kirkley for Labour is Peter Byatt, a retired teacher and Lowestoft town councillor; he was a Suffolk county councillor (for Pakefield division) until losing his seat to the Conservatives in May.  The Conservatives have selected Gilly Gunner.  The UKIP candidate is Phillip Trindall, who ran a carpentry and joinery business for over 35 years; he stood in the last Lowestoft by-election (in Oulton Broad ward in September) and did poorly.  Completing the ballot paper are Ben Quail for the Greens and Dominic Leslie for the Lib Dems.

In St Margaret's the defending Labour candidate is 27-year-old Nasima Begum, a Lowestoft town councillor who runs a Tandoori restaurant.  Returning from the 2015 election is the Conservatives' Linda Coulam, who runs a taxi firm with her husband.  UKIP have also reselected their 2015 candidate for the ward, Bernie Guymer.  Completing the ballot paper are Baz Bemment for the Green Party and Liberal Democrat Shaun Waters.

<h2>Penn and Coleshill</h2>

Chiltern council, Buckinghamshire; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Alan Hardie who had served since 2011.

http://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/chiltern-penn-coleshill.png

From one of the most deprived parts of Britain to one of the least.  Two weeks ago this column was in one of England's most expensive towns to buy property, Beaconsfield; this week we hop north over the town and district boundary to Penn and Coleshill ward.  Despite the ward name (which is taken from the two parishes it covers) the largest centre of population is Knotty Green which is essentially a northern extension of Beaconsfield.  Knotty Green claims England's oldest freehouse, the Royal Standard of England (first attested in 1213 when it was called The Ship).  The village of Penn itself lies on the eastern edge of High Wycombe, while Coleshill - once a detached part of Hertfordshire - lies halfway between Beaconsfield and Amersham.  This is a leafy part of the Chiltern Hills which is much in demand from TV and film companies due to its proximity to several major film studios.  The census stats show that Penn and Coleshill is clearly a commuter area: 55% of the workforce are in some form of management or professional occupation and half of the workforce hold degrees.

Penn and Coleshill is as true blue as you would expect from that introduction.  The 2003, 2007 and 2011 elections all saw the Conservatives poll over 70% of the vote in a straight fight with the Liberal Democrats.  The 2011 election here gave the Tories a 75-25 majority; in 2015 the Lib Dems gave up and the Conservative slate was elected without a contest.  The ward is split between two Buckinghamshire county divisions which are both safe Conservative.

Defending for the Conservatives, and in the unusual position for a W of top of the ballot paper, is Jonathan Waters who lives some distance away in a village near Chesham.  Ensuring a contested election this time is the Lib Dem candidate Richard Williams, an Amersham resident who fought the ward in 2003, 2007 and 2011.

<h2>Sudbrooke</h2>

West Lindsey council, Lincolnshire; caused by the resignation of Conserative councillor Stuart Curtis on health grounds.  He had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, and has since died at the age of 72.  Curtis lived all his life in the village of Sudbrooke, working for fifty years for a Lincoln firm of solicitors; he specialised in conveyancing, and had chaired the local branch of the Institute of Legal Executives.  Away from work he had been a qualified football referee, once taking charge of a Lincoln City testimonial match in front of over 5,000 spectators.  He had served on West Lindsey council since 1999.

http://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/w-lindsey-sudbrooke.png

From a safe Conservative ward in Buckinghamshire we move to two more safe Conservative wards in Lincolnshire.  The first of these is in Sudbrooke, a village about five miles north-east of Lincoln off the A158 Lincoln-Skegness road.  Sudbrooke's population grew strongly in the 1980s as a middle-class commuter village, dwarfing the older village of Scothern to the north; one legacy of that growth is that the ward makes the top 75 in England and Wales for owner-occupation (92% of households).

http://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2015/w-lindsey15.png

Sudbrooke ward was created in 1999 and has unchanged boundaries since then, having survived boundary reviews in 2007 and 2015.  It had also had unchanged representation, with Curtis having been the councillor since the ward's creation: he was originally an independent candidate and was returned unopposed in 2000, before gaining the Conservative nomination from 2004 onwards.  At Curtis' last re-election in 2015 his lead over the Labour candidate was 69-20.  The ward is within a safe Conservative Lincolnshire county division (Welton Rural) and a safe Conservative parliamentary seat (Gainsborough).

Defending for the Conservatives is Bob Waller - not the well-known psephologist but the vice-chairman of Sudbrooke parish council.  A former Army officer, Waller formerly ran an apprentice engineering training company and is also a former Teesside magistrate.  In a straight fight, he is opposed by Labour candidate and Sudbrooke resident Gareth Hart.

<h2>Whaplode and Holbeach St John's</h2>

South Holland council, Lincolnshire; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Mike Pullen at the age of 82.  Originally from London - his first job was as a rigger in the East End docks - Pullen had retired to Lincolnshire after jobs in brewing and insurance.  He had served on South Holland council since 2015.

http://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/s-holland-whaplode-holbeach-st-johns.png

For our second Lincolnshire by-election of the week we travel to the Fens, that agricultural landscape reclaimed from the North Sea which is every bit as flat and unremarkable as the map above might suggest.  Wards and parishes in this area tend to be long and thin, following the relatively high ground between the drainage ditches; this ward runs for 20 kilometres from the Cambridgeshire boundary to the intriguingly-named Saracen's Head on the A17 Sleaford-King's Lynn road.  Of the two villages in the title, Whaplode makes the unusual claim of having Lincolnshire's highest sculpture-to-population ratio, while Holbeach St Johns is a village slightly to the east on the line of the Greenwich Meridian.

Local politics in South Holland is, like the landscape, not the most exciting affair.  In the last two elections to Whaplode and Holbeach St John's ward the Conservatives have been guaranteed one of the two available seats due to insufficient opposition candidates.  Pullen was the opposition candidate in 2011 as an independent, losing an independent-held seat, before being elected in 2015 on the Tory slate.  That year the Conservatives had 57% to 43% for a single UKIP candidate.  The ward is split between three different Lincolnshire county divisions, all of which are safe Conservative.

Defending for the Conservatives is Janet Whitbourn, who lives in Spalding and was a presenter and manager on the local radio station Tulip Radio until its closure earlier this year; she now runs an events company.  In another straight fight Whitbourn is opposed by Jennie Thomas, an admin assistant and mother-of-four from Holbeach, who is the Labour candidate.

<h2>Staining and Weeton</h2>

Fylde council, Lancashire; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Albert Pounder due to ill-health.  He had served since 2003.

http://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/fylde-staining-weeton.png

After five by-elections in the east and the south of England it's time to move north.  Staining and Weeton ward covers a large area at the centre of the Fylde peninsula, immediately to the east of Blackpool.  Staining is the larger of the two villages covered by the ward, but Weeton is the more interesting one; defence is the main game in town here with a large barracks within the ward boundary, and Weeton hosts an annual reunion each June for the King's Own Royal Border Regiment.  In recent times the main controversy in the area has been fracking; Cuadrilla bored a test well in the ward in 2011 but had to stop operations after the drilling set off two minor earthquakes.

http://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2015/fylde15.png

Staining and Weeton ward was created in 2003 by merging two single-member wards: a decision which spelt the end of the political career of Labour's Alfred Goldberg who had represented Staining ward since 1991.  The ward is now safely Conservative and in 2015 the Tories led Labour here 65-35.  However, the Tories don't always get it all their own way in rural Fylde: the local county councillor is an independent.

Defending for the Conservatives is Jayne Nixon, an administration manager and Staining parish councillor.  The Labour candidate is Nick Ansell (from Blackpool), and completing the ballot paper is Beverley Harrison (from Lytham St Annes) of the Liberal Democrats.

<h2>Penrith North</h2>

Eden council, Cumbria; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Robin Howse, who is retiring on health and age grounds.  He had served since 2011.

http://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/eden-penrith-n.png

As Samuel Johnson once said, "the noblest prospect which a Scotchman ever sees, is the high road that leads him to England".  For many who journey between England and Scotland, whether in Johnson's day or in the modern day, their journey takes them through or past Penrith.  The Romans had a road which passed through Penrith on the way to Hadrian's Wall, and its modern successors (the A6 and M6), together with the West Coast main line, all pass through Penrith North ward.  As well as a rural hinterland, Penrith North is based on the northern part of the town: the Townhead district and the New Streets.  Fittingly some of the streets in the ward are named in honour of a pioneer of roads: John Loudon McAdam, who for a time lived in Penrith.

Penrith is the largest town in the Eden local government district, which despite its geographical size is the smallest local government district by population in north-west England; Penrith North is the district's largest ward but is still comfortably under 3,500 electors.  With small electorates like that the candidate starts to become more important than the party, and this is reflected in Penrith North's previous results where it's rare for any party to field a full slate.  Since 2011 the Liberal Democrats have held two seats in the ward to one for the Conservatives; shares of the vote in 2015 were 43% for the Lib Dems (two candidates), 32% for the Conservatives (full slate) and 25% for Labour (one candidate).  In May's county elections the Tories greatly increased their majority in the Penrith North county division, but that's much more rural in character than this ward.

Defending for the Liberal Democrats is local resident Mark Rudhall.  The Tory candidate is John Forrester, who runs a motorcycle training business and fought Penrith East in May's county elections.  The Labour candidate is Karen Lockney, a lecturer at the University of Cumbria.  Completing the ballot paper is Douglas Lawson of the Green Party.

<h2>Mowden; and<br/>
Red Hall and Lingfield</h2>

Darlington council, County Durham; caused respectively by the resignations of Conservative councillor Bill Stenson and Labour councillor Lynne Haszeldine.  One of the longest-serving councillors in the UK, Stenson is retiring after fifty-two years' service on Darlington council: he was first elected in 1965 for the Mowden ward of the former Darlington County Borough.  Haszeldine, who had served Lingfield ward and then Red Hall and Lingfield in tandem with her husband Ian since 2007, is suffering from poor health.

We finish the week with three contests in the Tees Valley mayoral area, two of which are in the town of Darlington.  Darlo has a reputation as a Quaker town, having been built through the efforts of many wealthy Quaker families, but is also known for the railways and heavy engineering: it was the terminus of the UK's first passenger railway, the Stockton and Darlington, became an important railway manufacturing centre, and for well over a century has been known for bridge-building.  The Cleveland Bridge company, which built such well-known bridges as the Tyne Bridge, the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Humber Bridge, is based in Darlington.  That economic prosperity helped make Darlington, until it became a unitary council in the 1990s, the largest town in County Durham.

http://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/darlington-mowden.png

In many towns and the cities in the UK the western end is a more desirable place to live than the eastern end, which typically suffers from pollution blown over from the rest of the town on the prevailing westerly wind.  Such is the case in Darlington and that's neatly illustrated by the two by-elections this week.  On the western edge of town is Mowden, the least-deprived ward in Darlington town; located south of Staindrop Road, the ward is centred on Bushel Hill Park.  Much of the ward was developed in the 1960s and 1970s, and judging from its age profile many of the original householders are still in situ: the ward is in the top 100 in England and Wales for retired population and owner-occupation is high.  Darlington's heavy engineering is illustrated by Mowden ward making the top 50 in England and Wales for apprenticeship qualifications and the top 25 for the census' "intermediate" occupational classification.  Mowden ward escaped a boundary review in 2015 unchanged.

http://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/darlington-red-hall-lingfield.png

That boundary review created Red Hall and Lingfield ward on the eastern edge of town, which took in the eastern areas of the former Lingfield and Haughton East wards.  If Mowden is where Darlington's well-off engineers live, this is where they work: Red Hall and Lingfield ward is dominated by Morton Park, a large industrial estate presently being redeveloped.  Companies based on Morton Park include the engine manufacturer Cummins and the English office of the beleaguered Student Loans Company.

http://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2015/darlington15.png

Darlington has a reputation as a Labour-inclined marginal area, but boundary effects mean that that doesn't always reflect the votes cast.  The parliamentary seat is drawn tightly around the town, whereas the district includes a few Tory-voting villages in its hinterland: that bolsters the Labour position at general election time (although Darlington did return the now ex-Defence Secretary Michael Fallon to Parliament during the Thatcher landslides).  Boundary effects are also at work at council level: the Conservatives polled the most votes across the district in both the 2007 and 2015 elections, but a poor vote distribution meant that Labour had a secure majority on the council both times.  Given the description above it shouldn't be surprising that Mowden is in the Conservative column with Red Hall and Lingfield in the Labour one: in 2015 Mowden had 46% for the Conservatives, 32% for Labour and 15% for UKIP, while Red Hall and Lingfield gave 47% to Labour, 29% to the Conservatives and 12% to the Green Party.  Interestingly the Conservatives performed very badly in a by-election in Mowden on Euro-election day in 2014, Labour cutting their majority to 33 votes; on the other hand the Tories can take heart from the fact that they carried Darlington in the Tees Valley mayoral election in May.

This column hasn't been able to find out much information about the Mowden candidates beyond their names.  Defending Mowden for the Conservatives is Alan Marshall.  The Labour candidate is Eddie Heslop.  UKIP are not contesting the seat this time, so the ballot paper is completed by Kathy Barley for the Green Party and Sarah Jordan for the Liberal Democrats.

By contrast the Red Hall and Lingfield by-election candidates are a well-attested and interesting bunch.  Labour have gone for youth in defending the seat: their candidate Sharifah Rahman isn't yet 20 but she's already the secretary of Darlington Young Labour.  The Conservatives' selection of Jonathan Dulston has hit the headlines for all the wrong reasons: a 28-year-old long-standing community volunteer and special constable, he was fined earlier this year by Newton Aycliffe magistrates for being drunk and disorderly and obstructing a police officer.  According to a report in the <em>Mirror</em>, Dulston claimed that "the fracas meant he was a candidate who 'represents reality' and has 'life experience'", which if true is the most impressive display of brass neck this column has seen for some time.  The Green candidate is Mike McTimoney, a lecturer who in 2009 was appointed as Darlington's official Tweeter-in-residence, whatever that is.  Also standing are Harry Longmoor for the Liberal Democrats and independent candidate Kevin Brack, who was the UKIP candidate for Darlington in June's general election.

<h2>Victoria</h2>

Hartlepool council, County Durham; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Trisha Lawton for family reasons.  She was first elected in 2010 for Rossmere ward, lost her seat in 2012, and returned to the council in 2015 for this ward.

http://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/hartlepool-victoria.png

We finish for the week in that most interesting of towns, Hartlepool.  Or, more accurately, two towns: Victoria ward covers the town centre of what was West Hartlepool, a nineteenth-century town built to serve docks on what was previously sand-dunes.  Here can be found the main shopping centre, Middleton Grange; and Hartlepool United's ground at Victoria Park, where the former mayor Stuart Drummond used to parade in his monkey suit.  Thanks to its proximity to the North Sea, Victoria Park had a reputation as the coldest ground in the Football League until the Pools got relegated last summer.  Also in the ward is some housing to the west of the town centre along Hart Lane.  At the time of the 2011 census most of the present ward was in Grange ward or Stranton ward, which were both notable for extremely high unemployment (nearly 13% in Stranton, over 10% in Grange).

Grange and Stranton wards had had full slates of Labour councillors since 2010, and that has carried forward to the current Victoria ward.  UKIP took over second place here in 2015 from the localist party Putting Hartlepool First: in 2016 Labour's lead over UKIP was 51-30.

Defending for Labour is Katie Trueman, who gives an address in Old Hartlepool on the headland.  The UKIP candidate is Jacqui Cummings, a carer.  Completing the ballot paper is Conservative candidate Andrew Martin-Wells.
