By-elections on 9th November 2017:

LIMESTONE PEAK

High Peak council, Derbyshire; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Daren Robins.  He had served since 2015.

Welcome to the Peak District.  We're just north of Buxton here in the village of Dove Holes, one of the highest villages in England at an altitude of over 1100 feet and, if you believe a 2001 poll for Radio 5 Live, one of the ugliest villages in England.  That's not an assessment your columnist agrees with - there are far worse places out there - but Dove Holes' setting on the busy A6 Buxton-Manchester road and the fact that the local industry is, as the ward name suggests, limestone quarrying doesn't help in the beauty stakes.  Rather more beautiful is the Derbyshire Wye Valley, a dramatic gorge between Buxton and Millers Dale, while in between lie the quarrying village of Peak Dale, the older village of Wormhill and hamlet of Tunstead which was the birthplace of the canal pioneer James Brindley.  The limestone quarrying has left its mark on the local workforce: Limestone Peak is in the top 40 wards in England and Wales for the ONS "lower supervisory, technical" occupational group.

Up here on the limestone plateau we really are in the debateable lands: where does the North end and the Midlands begin?  The official regional boundaries suggest that the East Midlands begins at the Cheshire-Derbyshire boundary, but the High Peak borough of Derbyshire is dominated by small towns like Glossop and New Mills that look towards Manchester rather than Derby as the nearest big city.  Those towns and Buxton are politically counterbalanced by some lovely but rather sparsely-populated countryside which has seen some interesting political fights over the last two years, often swinging in different directions at the same time.  In 2015 the Conservatives gained overall control of High Peak council with a majority of three at the same time as their MP Andrew Bingham was re-elected for a second term as MP for the High Peak constituency (which has the same boundaries), and held the Limestone Peak ward with 50% of the vote (to 27% for Labour and 23% for UKIP).

The Tories had an eye-catching performance across High Peak in May's county elections, gaining three seats from Labour and one from the Lib Dems to finish with six of the borough's eight county councillors to one each for Labour and the Lib Dems.  But this was an occasion where large seat changes are deceptive: all four of those gains were by majorities of fewer than 100 votes, with the Conservative majority in Buxton North and East (part of which is covered by this ward) being just 27 votes, and in vote terms Labour were only four percentage points behind the Conservatives across the borough with a large Lib Dem vote to squeeze.  Once you take that into account, together with the fact that High Peak is culturally a Granadaland seat rather than a Midlands one, the Labour gain of High Peak in June's general election starts to make a bit more sense.

No doubt Limestone Peak ward will now start swinging in a new direction just to confound us all further.  Defending for the Conservatives is Peter Roberts, a local resident from Peak Dale.  Labour have reselected their 2015 candidate Jim Lambert.  UKIP have not returned to the fray, so completeng the ballot paper are Peter Crook for the Green Party and Alistair Forbes for the Liberal Democrats.
