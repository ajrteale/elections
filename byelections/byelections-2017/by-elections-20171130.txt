The Met Office might recognise St Andrew's Day as the last day of autumn, but a quick look out of your columnist's window to the brooding, whitened mass of Winter Hill will serve to tell that winter has arrived.  Winter is a slow time for local by-elections, partly due to the prevailing weather and partly due to the fact that we are now on the countdown to the May 2018 local elections.  That gives by-election watchers the chance to pause for breath as we have just four polls this week, the fewest since the middle of September.  All of these are south of the M4 corridor, but that doesn't mean a lack of political diversity with all three major parties having one defence each.  Read on...

<h2>North</h2>

Maidstone council, Kent; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Michael Hemsley who had served since 2015.

http://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/maidstone-north.png

Last week we finished on the edge of Kent as the Conservatives held a ward based around the White Cliffs of Dover; this week we move inland to Kent's county town.  North ward saw an important development in English history in 1076 with the Trial of Penenden Heath.  This trial resolved a dispute between Odo, bishop of Bayeux and earl of Kent, and Lanfranc, archbishop of Canterbury, in Lanfranc's favour.  The subsequent Domesday Book records <em>Pinnedenna</em> as the place for Kent's landowners to report to the Shire Court.

Penenden Heath crops up many times later in history: it was a meeting-place in the Peasants' Revolt of 1381, in Wyatt's Rebellion of 1554 and during the Civil War, when the Royalist army assembled here in advance of their loss in the 1648 Battle of Maidstone.  Early cricket matches were played on the heath: in August and September 1795 Kent lost to England here by five wickets, proving that the England cricket team can win a match on occasion.  In later times Penenden Heath became a place of execution, then a recreation ground, before being built on in the 1960s.

The Heath forms about half of the present North ward, which runs north from Maidstone East railway station along the A229 road (towards Rochester) and the east bank of the Medway.  Much of the ward's acreage is taken up by the barracks of Invicta Park, home to 36 Engineer Regiment.  This regiment includes two squadrons of Gurkhas, whose presence puts North ward in the top 50 wards in England and Wales for Buddhism.  Also within the ward boundaries are Maidstone Prison (as seen in the title sequence of <em>Porridge</em>), and the Gallagher Stadium, home to the non-league football team Maidstone United and the first English football stadium built with 3G artificial turf.  The census picked up a significant Polish population at the southern end of the ward, but this may be an effect of the prison which holds a large number of foreign nationals within the UK's penal systems.

Now, in this by-election the stakes are high.  North ward is normally a safe Liberal Democrat area, although the Conservatives came close in 2011 and UKIP were not far off winning a seat in 2014.  Since the current ward boundaries were introduced in 1979 the Conservatives have won only four seats here: two in that initial 1979 election, one in 1992 and Michael Hemsley's seat in 2015 which came with a majority of just 25 votes over the Lib Dems.  Local elections since 2015 do not give much cause for optimism that the Conservatives can hold this one: in the 2016 election the Liberal Democrats won here with 43%, to 24% for the Conservatives and 17% for UKIP; and the Lib Dem had a similar lead in May's Kent county elections in the local Maidstone North East division.  To add to that, this by-election will determine who is the largest party on the hung Maidstone council: going into this poll the Lib Dems (who run the council as a minority administration) and Conservatives were tied on 22 seats each, with four independents, four Kippers and two Labour councillors holding the balance of power.

Defending for the Conservatives is Cheryl Taylor-Maggio, chairman of Langley parish council (located a few miles south-east of Maidstone); she fought the county seat here in May.  Hoping to return to the borough council is Liberal Democrat candidate Rob Field, who was councillor for Park Wood ward from a November 2006 by-election until standing down in 2012; he works in the health sector.  UKIP have not returned to the fray, so the ballot paper is completed by Labour's Maureen Cleator who fought this ward in 2016, and the Greens' Derek Eagle who has stood here on several previous occasions.

<h2>Westway</h2>

Tandridge council, Surrey; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Caroline Warner who had served since 2016.  She is moving away from the area.

http://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/tandridge-westway.png

We move west along the North Downs and inside the M25 motorway, although just outside the Greater London boundary, to the town of Caterham.  Administratively Caterham is not one town, but two: Westway lies within the western half, known as Caterham on the Hill for obvious reasons.  We retain a link with the Army: much of Westway ward was formerly occupied by Caterham Barracks, which closed in the 1990s with the site having been redeveloped for housing in the 1990s and 2000s.

http://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2016/tandridge16.png

Westway is the most deprived of the five wards covering Caterham on the Hill and Caterham Valley, and despite high employment levels has relatively large amounts of social housing.  This enabled the ward to vote Labour at the height of Tony Blair's powers, and as recently as 2002 Labour polled 36% of the vote here.  The Lib Dems got ahead of Labour in the 2004 election, and then the Labour vote collapsed in their favour to create a Lib Dem/Tory marginal.  Since 2008 the ward's two seats have been split between the Conservatives and Lib Dems; the Liberal Democrats held their seat last year on a rather low share of the vote, 36% to 29% for the Conservatives and 19% for UKIP.  In May's Surrey county elections the local Caterham Hill division produced a photo-finish, the Liberal Democrats holding their seat by just 12 votes.

Defending for the Liberal Democrats is Helen Rujbally, a local resident who works supporting people with learnings disabilities: she was a victim of flash-flooding in 2016.  Alex Standen is standing for the Conservatives; he was a UKIP candidate in the 2016 local elections.  The official UKIP candidate is Helena Windsor, a former Surrey county councillor (Godstone, 2013-17).  Completing the ballot paper is Labour candidate Lucy McNally.

<h2>Bridgemary North</h2>

Gosport council, Hampshire; caused by the death of Labour councillor Jill Wright at the age of 69.  The Mayoress of Gosport in 2001-02, Wright was first elected to Gosport council in 1997 for Rowner ward, transferring to Bridgemary South ward in 2002.  She lost her seat in 2008 but returned to the council in 2012 for Bridgemary North ward.  Away from the council, Wright worked for 26 years as practice manager at the Bridgemary medical centre.

http://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/gosport-bridgemary-n.png

We travel south-west from Caterham to the Solent conurbation.  This is a badly-planned area of large towns and associated housing estates, with Bridgemary being one of the largest estates.  Almost entirely developed since the Second World War, this is the northern end of the town of Gosport hard up against the border with Fareham.  Gosport is of course a naval town, and within the boundaries of Bridgemary North ward is Fleetlands Heliport, opened during the war as a naval air yard and now used as a maintenance base for both military and civil helicopters.  Also within the ward is the misleadingly-named Fareham Business Park, home to the book printers Ashford Colour Press and the pharmaceutical testing company Wickham Laboratories.  So, despite the ward's low qualification levels (it is just outside the top 100 in the UK for those with between 1 and 5 GCSE passes or equivalent) there are plenty of jobs here.

http://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2016/gosport16.png

The ward was created in 2002 as part of a major reorganisation of Gosport's wards, in which the town became one of the handful of English districts to introduce the system of election by halves.  Bridgemary North's working-class economic profile normally creates a safe Labour ward, although the Conservatives did win here in 2008 with a majority of just 50 votes.  Jill Wright recovered that loss for Labour in 2012 to rejoin on the council her husband Dennis, who is the ward's other councillor.  In 2016 Jill was re-elected for the last time, beating the Conservatives 72-28 in a straight fight.  However, Labour did very badly here in May's county elections, losing their seat in the Bridgemary division and actually falling to third place behind the Tories and Lib Dems.

Defending for Labour is local resident James Fox, who is retired after a career spent working for local firms and the MoD.  The Conservative candidate Richard Dickson is hoping to make a quick return to the council after losing his seat in Christchurch ward in 2016; he had represented that ward since 2004 and was Mayor of Gosport in 2012-13.  Completing the ballot paper is Stephen Hammond, who has been tempted by his second-place performance in May's county elections to become the ward's first Liberal Democrat candidate.

<h2>Torrington</h2>

Torridge council, Devon; caused by the resignation of councillor Roger Darch, who had been elected for the UK Independence Party but was sitting as an independent.

http://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/torridge-torrington.ong

For our final poll of the week we enter the West Country.  Readers of Henry Williamson's <em>Tarka the Otter</em> will have an image in their mind's eye of the Torridge valley, of which Great Torrington is the major settlement.  Williamson's work has brought some tourists to the town, which still retains a large number of independent shops because it's too small and remote to interest the national chains.  However, the largest employer in the town is glass-making: Dartington Crystal runs the UK's last remaining crystal factory here.

http://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2015/torridge15.png

This market town may be tiny, but in 1958 Torrington gave its name to a parliamentary seat which was gained by the Liberal Party in a famous by-election.  More recent results in the town have been fragmented: this is the sort of area where a local independent can build up a high profile, and long-serving independent councillor Margaret Brown has developed a clear personal vote to do just that.  In the 2007 election her ward colleagues were a Conservative and a Liberal Democrat; the Lib Dem councillor resigned in 2013 as he was moving to Norfolk, and the party did not defend the resulting by-election which was won by the Green Party's Cathrine Simmons.  Brown and Simmons were re-elected in first and second place in 2015, with the Conservatives losing their seat to UKIP's Roger Darch; shares of the vote were 28% for Brown, 26% for the Greens, 24% for UKIP and 22% for the Conservatives.  The Tories had a big lead in the local county seat (Torrington Rural) in May, with UKIP's Darch falling to fourth place.  On a more sour note, a by-election in August to Great Torrington town council - which has the same boundaries as this ward - created controversy after the (unsuccessful) Liberal Democrat candidate reportedly sent an explicit picture of himself dressed as a mouse to the (unsuccessful) Labour candidate.

Hopefully this by-election will be more decorous, although anyone without local knowledge would be hard-pressed to pick a winner.  Defending for UKIP is John Pitts, secretary of Great Torrington bowls club and Darch's running-mate here in 2015.  Standing as an independent candidate is Di Davey, who has recently succeeded Darch as Deputy Mayor of Great Torrington.  The Green Party have selected Sue Clarke, who is a teacher.  Returning from the 2015 election is the Conservatives' Harold Martin, who is seeking to return to Torridge council; he represented Two Rivers ward from 2011 to 2015 when he unsuccessfully sought election here.  Completing the ballot paper is Liberal Democrat candidate Cheryl Cottle-Hunkin, a teacher and sheep farmer.
