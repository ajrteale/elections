The Met Office might recognise St Andrew's Day as the last day of autumn, but a quick look out of your columnist's window to the brooding, whitened mass of Winter Hill will serve to tell that winter has arrived.  Winter is a slow time for local by-elections, partly due to the prevailing weather and partly due to the fact that we are now on the countdown to the May 2018 local elections.  That gives by-election watchers the chance to pause for breath as we have just four polls this week, the fewest since the middle of September.  All of these are south of the M4 corridor, but that doesn't mean a lack of political diversity with all three major parties having one defence each.  Read on...



North

Maidstone council, Kent; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Michael Hemsley who had served since 2015.

Last week we finished on the edge of Kent as the Conservatives held a ward based aroud the White Cliffs of Dover; this week we move inland to Kent's county town.  North ward saw an important development in English history in 1076 with the Trial of Penenden Heath.  This trial resolved a dispute between Odo, bishop of Bayeux and earl of Kent, and Lanfranc, archbishop of Canterbury, in Lanfranc's favour.  The subsequent Domesday Book records <em>Pinnedenna</em> as the place for Kent's landowners to report to the Shire Court.

Penenden Heath crops up many times later in history: it was a meeting-place in the Peasants' Revolt of 1381, in Wyatt's Rebellion of 1554 and during the Civil War, when the Royalist army assembled here in advance of their loss in the 1648 Battle of Maidstone.  Early cricket matches were played on the heath: in August and September 1795 Kent lost to England here by five wickets, proving that the England cricket team can win a match on occasion.  In later times Penenden Heath became a place of execution, then a recreation ground, before being built on in the 1960s.

The Heath forms about half of the present North ward, which runs north from Maidstone East railway station along the A229 road (towards Rochester) and the east bank of the Medway.  Much of the ward's acreage is taken up by the barracks of Invicta Park, home to 36 Engineer Regiment.  This regiment includes two squadrons of Gurkhas, whose presence puts North ward in the top 50 in England and Wales for Buddhism.  Also within the ward boundaries are Maidstone Prison (as seen in the title sequence of <em>Porridge</em>), and the Gallagher Stadium, home to the non-league football team Maidstone United and the first English football stadium built with 3G artificial turf.  The census picked up a significant Polish population at the southern end of the ward, but this may be an effect of the prison which holds a large number of foreign nationals within the UK's penal systems.

Now, in this by-election the stakes are high.  North ward is normally a safe Liberal Democrat area, although the Conservatives came close in 2011 and UKIP were not far off winning a seat in 2014.  Since the current ward boundaries were introduced in 1979 the Conservatives have won only four seats here: two in that initial 1979 election, one in 1992 and Michael Hemsley's seat in 2015 which came with a majority of just 25 votes over the Lib Dems.  Local elections since 2015 do not give much cause for optimism that the Conservatives can hold this one: in the 2016 election the Liberal Democrats won here with 43%, to 24% for the Conservatives and 17% for UKIP; and the Liberal Democrats had a similar lead in May's Kent county elections in the local Maidstone North East division.  To add to that, this by-election will determine who is the largest party on the hung Maidstone council; going into this poll the Lib Dems (who run the council as a minority administration) and Conservatives were tied on 22 seats each, with four independents, four Kippers and two Labour councillors holding the balance of power.

Defending for the Conservatives is Cheryl Taylor-Maggio, chairman of Langley parish council (located a few miles south-east of Maidstone); she fought the county seat here in May.  Hoping to return to the borough council is Liberal Democrat candidate Rob Field, who was councillor for Park Wood ward from a November 2006 by-election until standing down in 2012; he works in the health sector.  UKIP have not returned to the fray, so the ballot paper is completed by Labour's Maureen Cleator who fought this ward in 2016, and the Greens' Derek Eagle who has stood here on several previous occasions.
