Rossall

Wyre council, Lancashire; caused by the death of Labour councillor Edwin "Ted" Taylor, who had served since 2003 and was Deputy Mayor of Wyre in 2007-08.

For our first English by-election of the week we are on the western Fylde coast, which may be marked by sandy beaches but here is rather more desolate than even Blackpool on a bad day.  We're in the town of Fleetwood, a Victorian town dating from the 1830s when it was extensively redeveloped by Peter Hesketh-Fleetwood, the local landowner, MP and High Sheriff of Lancaster.  Hesketh-Fleetwood had his house at Rossall Hall, a now-demolished residence in what is now the south-western corner of the town.

The main feature of the ward is Rossall School, a fee-paying school next to the tram line to Blackpool which dates from Fleetwood's expansion: Rossall School was founded in 1844 as a sister to Marlborough College, and has an impressive list of former pupils.  Old Rossallians include musicians as diverse as Thomas Beecham and Little Boots, authors from Leslie Charteris to J G Ballard, a number of former MPs (although none currently serving) and a Head of State: Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, the President of Peru, was a pupil at Rossall School in the 1950s, when he was a contemporary of Dan Dare.  The presence of Rossall School rather skews the ward's census statistics - the census district covering the school had 17% of its population born in China and 11% in Germany, and the school puts the ward named after it into the top 50 wards in England and Wales for 16- and 17-year-olds, and the ward is also in the top 100 for those who did not answer the census' religion question.

Fleetwood is not the most prosperous of towns - its fishing fleet, the town's traditional economic mainstay, was destroyed by the Cod Wars with Iceland, several attempts to establish a ferry link to the Isle of Man or Ireland have foundered, and the main remaining industries are fish processing and Lofthouse's Fisherman's Friends.  Rossall ward includes a very deprived census district, and this creates a Labour-voting political profile for the ward, although Rossall is not safe: the Tories came within seven points of Labour in 2011 and in the 2015 - when the ward survived a boundary review unchanged - the Labour share fell further although their lead increased slightly.  Shares of the vote in that 2015 election were 39% for Labour, 30% for the Conservatives and 24% for UKIP.

An interesting boundary change for this year's county elections transferred Rossall into a new division based on Tory-voting Cleveleys; the resulting "Fleetwood West and Cleveleys West" was in the Conservative column in May's county elections and formed part of the Tory group of 46 councillors which took over County Hall with an overall majority of eight.  Less than five months later, an amazing series of misfortunes and self-inflicted wounds has seen that majority all but wiped out.  Two Tory councillors have left the group after falling out with the council leader, a third has been thrown out of the party for overclaiming thousands of pounds in council tax benefit, and a fourth has recently died, cutting the Tory majority to one.  And there may be more to come: a fifth Tory county councillor has been suspended for alleged anti-Islamic comments on social media, and the Leader of the Council, no less, is being investigated by police on suspicion of perverting the course of justice and intimidating witnesses.  This is the sort of stuff local government watchers expect to see from UKIP, not from a serious political party.

The bizarreness doesn't end at County Hall either.  This by-election has taken an unusually long time to come to fruition, given that Ted Taylor died in March.  Now by-elections in England and Wales don't just happen automatically: they have to be called, and this is done by two electors from the ward writing to the returning officer asking for a by-election to be held to fill a vacancy.  (This is normally orchestrated by the political parties and tends to be a prompt process: on the other hand, the Council of the Isles of Scilly had a vacancy for its entire 2013-17 term due to insufficient candidates from the island of Bryher.)  Once the returning officer gets the call, he is bound by law to hold a poll within 35 working days.  In the case of Rossall, that didn't happen: the request for an election was duly made in early August, but the returning officer has refused to hold a poll until now, 52 working days later, citing staff shortages.

We wait to see whether this by-election will contribute to the most bizarre crisis on the Fylde since a dead pheasant got into the water supply a couple of years ago.  Defending for Labour is Cheryl Raynor, a Fleetwood town councillor.  The Conservatives have selected Maggie Pattinson, who gives an address some distance away in the village of Pilling.  With UKIP withdrawing from the fray, the ballot paper is completed by local resident Brian Crawford, a former Cumbria county councillor (representing Millom as a Conservative from 2013 until May this year) standing as an independent.

Chapelford and Old Hall

Warrington council, Cheshire; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Faisal Rashid, who is now MP for Warrington South.  He had served since 2011, originally being elected for Whittle Hall ward and transferring to this ward in 2016.

For the North West's other by-election we are in the new town of Warrington, and one of the more recently developed parts of it.  Chapelford is a fast-growing urban area in the north-west of Warrington, located between Whittle Avenue and Cromwell Avenue; the area was once close to the US Air Force base at Burtonwood, and many of its street names (Boston Boulevard being the most prominent) are on an American theme.  Most of the ward's housing has gone up since 2000 or even in this decade, and because of that the 2011 census might no longer be all that reliable here; for what it's worth, Whittle Hall ward (which covered most of this area in 2011) had a demographic of young families then with relatively high education levels and very high full-time employment.  It's not surprising that Chapelford has an attracted an urban professional demographic given the proximity of the area to the motorway network: M62 junction 8 is a short distance away.  That's despite the prescence in the ward of Old Hall, an older New Town area which scores rather poorly on the deprivation indices.

The Whittle Hall ward which covered this area until 2016 tended to be a Labour versus Lib Dem marginal: Faisal Rashid gained his seat in 2011 from the Lib Dems, and at the time of the ward's abolition Labour held two seats to the Lib Dems' one.  The cut-down Chapelford and Old Hall turned in a good Labour performance at the only previous election on these boundaries, in 2016: that year Labour had 45% - clearly boosted by a personal vote for Rashid - to 21% for the Lib Dems and 18% for the Conservatives.  (On a personal note, the Lib Dem slate that year included David Knapp, an engineer whom your columnist has got to know from the quiz circuit.)

Defending for Labour is Paul Warburton, a personal trainer who represents most of the ward on Great Sankey parish council.  The Lib Dems have reselected maths teacher Allan Bird, who fought the ward in 2015 and was top of their slate here last year.  Hoping to get back on Warrington council is Conservative candidate Phil Hayward, a former borough councillor (for the wonderfully-named Locking Stumps, Gorse Covert and Risley ward, 1991-97) and more recently mayor of Didcot in Oxfordshire in 2011-12.  Completing the ballot paper are Ian Wilson for UKIP and Stephanie Davies for the Green Party.
