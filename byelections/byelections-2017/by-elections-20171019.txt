"All the right votes, but not necessarily in the right order"

Like the first two Thursdays of the month, 19th October 2017 sees eight by-elections, but it could have been more.  There was a ninth by-election scheduled for today in the Haseley Brook ward of South Oxfordshire district, but when nominations closed the Conservatives' Caroline Newton was the only candidate and she has therefore been elected unopposed.  This column sends its congratulations to Councillor Newton.  Of the eight remaining seats up for election this week, there are five Labour defences (three of which are in the city of Nottingham), two Conservative defences and an independent seat up for election.  Three of the Labour vacancies arise from newly-elected MPs leaving their council seats behind to concentrate on Westminster; as they join the ranks of the Commons we start this week by paying tribute to one former MP who has recently left us.

<h2>Lower Sheering</h2>

Epping Forest council, Essex; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Gary Waller at the age of 72.

One of the few councillors notable enough to merit his own Wikipedia page, Waller was a Conservative MP throughout the Thatcher and Major administrations.  He gained the marginal seat of Brighouse and Spenborough from Labour in 1979, and when that seat was abolished in the 1983 boundary changes gained the Keighley seat from Labour, holding it until 1997.  Waller never got off the backbenches, but during the 1992 Parliament was chairman of the House of Commons Information Committee, which oversaw Parliamentary IT and the House of Commons Library.  The Major administration was never short of scandal, and Waller's contribution to that was to have an affair - resulting in a son - with Sir Marcus Fox' secretary.  Waller moved from Yorkshire to Essex after his parliamentary career ended, being elected to Epping Forest council in 2011 and serving as chairman of the Harlow branch of the Conservative party.  Away from politics his interests included history and his collection of Jaguar cars.

Waller ended his days as a councillor in the Lea Valley.  Despite its presence in the Harlow parliamentary seat, Lower Sheering doesn't really have all that much to with Essex: the village of Lower Sheering itself is essentially an extension of the Hertfordshire town of Sawbridgeworth, most of the ward has a Sawbridgeworth postcode (CM21) and the ONS classifies it as within the Cambridge travel to work area.  Sawbridgeworth station, on the West Anglia main line, lies just outside the ward boundary.  Lower Sheering saw strong population growth in the 1980s and 1990s and has a blue-collar commuter demographic, with high employment levels.

This adds up to a Conservative ward has you might expect.  At the most recent poll in 2015 Waller defeated Labour 70-30 in a straight fight, and in May the Tories polled over 78% in the local county division (North Weald and Nazeing).

Defending for the Tories is Paul Stalker, a Sheering parish councillor (although for Sheering Village parish ward, which is not part of this ward).  Labour have withdrawn from the fray, but the Liberal Democrats have ensured a contested election by selecting Epping resident Ingrid Black.

<h2>Basford;
Bestwood; and
Bulwell Forest</h2>

Nottingham council; caused respectively by the resignation of Alex Norris who is now MP for Nottingham North, the resignation of Mick Wildgust and the death of Alan Clark at the age of 66.  All three were Labour councillors; Norris had served since 2011, Wildgust since 2007.

Having got the southern starters out of the way, the main course this week is three by-elections for adjoining wards in northern Nottingham.  We'll start alphabetically with the ward closest to the centre: Basford, which was incorporated into Nottingham in 1877 and still retains much of its original Victorian housing in the Old Basford area.  Basford once had three railway stations serving it; it now has none but is served by five stations on Nottingham's tram system, Wilkinson Street, Basford, David Lane and Highbury Vale on the main route together with Cinderhill on the Phoenix Park branch.  The ward's main traditional industries were soap and brewing, with the Shipstones brewery closing in 1991 and Cussons making Imperial Leather in Basford until 2005  This is a highly multi-ethnic area: Basford ward makes the top 15 wards in England and Wales for mixed-race population (8.5%).

Further out along the tram line is Bulwell Forest ward (served by Bulwell and Bulwell Forest tram stops), a more traditional working-class area although still with a relatively high Black and Asian population.  Bestwood ward lies to the north-east, between Arnold Road and Queens Boulevard: based on the notorious 1930s Bestwood Estate and the rather more conventional 1950s-60s Bestwood Park Estate, Bestwood ward still has very high levels of unemployment and social housing and makes the top 80 wards in England and Wales for mixed-race population.  Just outside the Bestwood ward boundary, and providing a large number of jobs in the area, is the Nottingham City Hospital which provides cancer care services for the region and has a national reputation for shoulder surgery.

All three of these wards are safe Labour under current political conditions.  Bulwell Forest possibly has the most interesting history: in 2003 Labour won all three seats with independent candidate Karen Kemp and the Conservatives close behnd, and in the 2007 election the Conservatives gained one of the Labour seats.  Basford ward voted Lib Dem in 2003 but then the Lib Dem vote fell apart and the ward was an easy Labour gain in 2007.  One of the Labour councillors stood for re-election as an independent in 2011 and got nowhere, his seat being easily held for Labour by Alex Norris whose political career started there.  At the most recent city election in 2015 shares of the vote in Basford ward were 48% for Labour, 20% for the Conservatives and 16% for UKIP.  Labour beat UKIP 56-22 in Bestwood ward, while Bulwell Forest ward had the lowest Labour share in this group: 46%, to 20% each for UKIP and the Conservatives.

Defending Alex Norris MP's seat for Labour in Basford ward is Nick Raine, a Unite officer representing teachers in the East Midlands and Yorkshire.  The Conservatives have selected Bradley Wing, an entrepreneur in his early 20s.  UKIP have secured something of a coup by selecting Bill Ottewell, a Labour councillor for this ward from 2011 to 2015; in 2015 he sought election in Clifton North ward and was defeated.  Completing the Basford ballot paper are Zeb Brigham for the Green Party and Rebecca Proctor for the Liberal Democrats.  Some of Basford's voters may be pleased to note that their polling station is a pub: the Mill and the Headstocks, both on Bagnall Road, have been pressed into the service of democracy.

In Bestwood ward the councillor being replaced is Mick Wildgust, Lord Mayor of Nottingham in 2011-12, who is standing down on health grounds after being first elected in 2007.  Labour are hoping his replacement will be Georgia Power, a recent Nottingham University graduate and women's officer for Labour's Nottingham South branch.  UKIP have reselected Francesco Lari who fought the ward in 2015, and the ballot paper is completed by the Conservatives' William Scott, the Greens' Liam McClelland, David Bishop of his Bus-Pass Elvis Party - Bishop may have hung up his blue suede shoes as far as parliamentary by-elections are concerned, but will still turn out for a local by-election in his native Nottingham - and the Lib Dems' Christina Morgan-Danvers.  Voters in polling district BESE are asked to note that their usual polling place at the Robin Hood Primary School is not available and they will vote instead at the Bestwood Park Community Centre.

Finally we come to Bulwell Forest ward where the late councillor, Open University lecturer Alan Clark, had had 29 years' service on Nottingham city council, first being elected for the predecessor Byron ward in 1988.  His council career focused on energy and environmental issues, and he was responsible for setting up the UK's first council-owned energy company, the not-for-profit Robin Hood Energy.  Clark's wife Eunice Campbell, another councillor for the ward, survives him.  

Defending Bulwell Forest for Labour is Cheryl Barnard, who runs a property leasing company.  UKIP have reselected Tony Blay who fought the ward in 2015.  The Tory candidate is Karen Kemp, who was runner-up in this ward in the 2003 election as an independent.  Completing the Bulwell Forest ballot paper are Andrew Jones of the Green Party and Callum Southern of the Liberal Democrats.
