"All the right votes, but not necessarily in the right order"

Like the first two Thursdays of the month, 19th October 2017 sees eight by-elections, but it could have been more.  There was a ninth by-election scheduled for today in the Haseley Brook ward of South Oxfordshire district, but when nominations closed the Conservatives' Caroline Newton was the only candidate and she has therefore been elected unopposed.  This column sends its congratulations to Councillor Newton.  Of the eight remaining seats up for election this week, there are five Labour defences (three of which are in the city of Nottingham), two Conservative defences and Britain Elects' favourite type of by-election, a free-for-all to replace an independent councillor in that most interesting of towns, Hartlepool.  Three of the Labour vacancies arise from newly-elected MPs leaving their council seats behind to concentrate on their new careers in Westminster; as they join the ranks of the Commons we start this week by paying tribute to one former MP who has recently left us.

<h2>Lower Sheering</h2>

Epping Forest council, Essex; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Gary Waller at the age of 72.

One of the few councillors notable enough to merit his own Wikipedia page, Waller was a Conservative MP throughout the Thatcher and Major administrations.  He gained the marginal seat of Brighouse and Spenborough from Labour in 1979, and when that seat was abolished in the 1983 boundary changes gained the Keighley seat from Labour, holding it until 1997.  Waller never got off the backbenches, but during the 1992 Parliament was chairman of the House of Commons Information Committee, which oversaw Parliamentary IT and the House of Commons Library.  The Major administration was never short of scandal, and Waller's contribution to that was to have an affair - resulting in a son - with Sir Marcus Fox' secretary.  Waller moved from Yorkshire to Essex after his parliamentary career ended, being elected to Epping Forest council in 2011 and serving as chairman of the Harlow branch of the Conservative party.  Away from politics his interests included history and his collection of Jaguar cars.

Gary Waller ended his days as a councillor in the Lea Valley.  Despite its presence in the Harlow parliamentary seat, Lower Sheering doesn't really have all that much to with Essex: the village of Lower Sheering itself is essentially an extension of the Hertfordshire town of Sawbridgeworth, most of the ward has a Sawbridgeworth postcode (CM21) and the ONS classifies it as within the Cambridge travel to work area.  Sawbridgeworth station, on the West Anglia main line, lies just outside the ward boundary.  Lower Sheering saw strong population growth in the 1980s and 1990s and has a blue-collar commuter demographic, with high employment levels.

http://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2015/epping-forest15.png

This adds up to a Conservative ward as you might expect.  Waller was first elected here in 2011, defeating former councillor Charlotte Edwards who had won a by-election in November 2009 but sought re-election as an independent.  At the most recent election to this ward in 2015 Waller defeated Labour 70-30 in a straight fight, and in May the Tories polled over 78% in the local county division (North Weald and Nazeing).

Defending for the Tories is Paul Stalker, a Sheering parish councillor (although for Sheering Village parish ward, which is not part of this ward).  Labour have withdrawn from the fray, but the Liberal Democrats have ensured a contested election by selecting Epping resident Ingrid Black who stood here at the 2009 by-election.

<h2>Meopham North</h2>

Gravesham council, Kent; caused by the death of Conservative councillor John Cubitt who had served since winning a by-election in October 2011.

http://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/gravesham-meopham-n.png

For our by-election south of the Thames this week we stay in commuter territory.  Meopham (pronounced MEPP-ham) is a village in the Kentish North Downs five miles south of Gravesend, on the Chatham Main Line to Victoria; this makes it a well-off area popular with London commuters, and the ward is part of the London Travel to Work Area.  The village is rather strung out from north to south, and as the name suggests this ward is the northern half of Meopham parish and includes the whole of the village with the associated settlements of Meopham Green and Meopham Station.

http://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2015/gravesham15.png

Meopham North is the first of two wards this week to have previously appeared in Andrew's Previews, and has a very high councillor attrition rate: this is the fourth by-election here since the last boundary change in 2003, and that's without counting the 2007 ordinary election which was postponed to June following the death of a candidate.  The October 2011 by-election here was the subject of an opinion poll - believed to be the first ever opinion poll for a UK local by-election - conducted by Survation for ITV Meridian with a sample size of 300.  Headline figures were C 52% UKIP 26% Lab 20% LD 2%; the figures for third and fourth proved to be off with the Lib Dems eventually finishing third, but the poll did correctly indicate that UKIP would come a strong second.  UKIP were still second at the 2015 ordinary election, in which the Conservative slate beat them 57-22.  The Tories did even better in May's county elections in the local division (Gravesham Rural).

Defending for the Conservatives is Gary Harding, who hasn't let his deafness put him off trying for a political career: he was the UKIP candidate for Lewisham West and Penge in the 2015 general election, and in May's county elections was on the Conservative slate in the Labour division of Northfleet and Gravesend West.  This should be a safer berth.  The official UKIP candidate is Tina Brooker, a legal secretary and pro-streetlight campaigner who is from Gravesend; she fought the Gravesend East county division in a by-election last year and in May's ordinary election.  Also standing are regular Labour candidate Doug Christie and the Lib Dems' John Death.

<h2>Basford;
Bestwood; and
Bulwell Forest</h2>

Nottingham council; caused respectively by the resignation of Alex Norris who is now MP for Nottingham North, the resignation of Mick Wildgust and the death of Alan Clark at the age of 66.  All three were Labour councillors.

http://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/nottingham-basford-bestwood-bulwell-forest.png

Having got the southern starters out of the way, the main course this week is three by-elections for adjoining wards in northern Nottingham.  We'll start alphabetically with the ward closest to the centre, Basford, which was incorporated into Nottingham in 1877 and still retains much of its original Victorian housing in the Old Basford area.  Basford once had three railway stations serving it; it now has none but is served by five stations on Nottingham's tram system.  They are Wilkinson Street, Basford, David Lane and Highbury Vale on the main route together with Cinderhill on the Phoenix Park branch.  The ward's main traditional industries were soap and brewing, with the Shipstones brewery closing in 1991 and Cussons making Imperial Leather in Basford until 2005  This is a highly multi-ethnic area: Basford ward makes the top 15 wards in England and Wales for mixed-race population (8.5%).

Further out along the tram line is Bulwell Forest ward (served by Bulwell and Bulwell Forest tram stops), a more traditional working-class area although still with a relatively high Black and Asian population.  Bestwood ward lies to the north-east, between Arnold Road and Queens Boulevard, and is based on the notorious 1930s Bestwood Estate and the rather quieter 1950s-60s Bestwood Park Estate.  Bestwood ward still has very high levels of unemployment and social housing and makes the top 80 wards in England and Wales for mixed-race population.  Just outside the Bestwood ward boundary, and supplying a large number of jobs in the area, is the Nottingham City Hospital which provides cancer care services for the region and has a national reputation for shoulder surgery.

http://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2015/nottingham15.png

As the map above suggests, all three of these wards are safe Labour under current political conditions.  Bulwell Forest possibly has the most interesting history: in 2003 Labour won all three seats with independent candidate Karen Kemp and the Conservatives close behind, and in the 2007 election the Conservatives gained one of the Labour seats.  Basford ward voted Lib Dem in 2003 but then the Lib Dem vote fell apart and the ward was an easy Labour gain in 2007.  One of the Labour councillors for Basford stood for re-election as an independent in 2011 and got nowhere, his seat being easily held for Labour by Alex Norris whose political career started there.  At the most recent city election in 2015 shares of the vote in Basford ward were 48% for Labour, 20% for the Conservatives and 16% for UKIP.  Labour beat UKIP 56-22 in Bestwood ward, while Bulwell Forest ward had the lowest Labour share in this group: 46%, to 20% each for UKIP and the Conservatives.

Defending Alex Norris MP's seat for Labour in Basford ward is Nick Raine, a Unite officer representing teachers in the East Midlands and Yorkshire.  The Conservatives have selected Bradley Wing, an entrepreneur in his early 20s.  UKIP have secured something of a coup by selecting Bill Ottewell, a Labour councillor for this ward from 2011 to 2015; in 2015 he sought election in Clifton North ward and was defeated.  Completing the Basford ballot paper are Zeb Brigham for the Green Party and Rebecca Proctor for the Liberal Democrats.  Some of Basford's voters may be pleased to note that their polling station is a pub: the Mill and the Headstocks, both on Bagnall Road, have been pressed into the service of democracy.

In Bestwood ward the councillor being replaced is Mick Wildgust, Lord Mayor of Nottingham in 2011-12, who is standing down on health grounds after being first elected in 2007.  Labour are hoping his replacement will be Georgia Power, a recent Nottingham University graduate and women's officer for Labour's Nottingham South branch.  UKIP have reselected Francesco Lari who fought the ward in 2015, and the ballot paper is completed by the Conservatives' William Scott, the Greens' Liam McClelland, David Bishop of his Bus-Pass Elvis Party - Bishop may have hung up his blue suede shoes as far as parliamentary by-elections are concerned, but will still turn out for a local by-election in his native Nottingham - and the Lib Dems' Christina Morgan-Danvers.  Voters in polling district BESE are asked to note that their usual polling place at the Robin Hood Primary School is not available and they will vote instead at the Bestwood Park Community Centre.

Finally we come to Bulwell Forest ward where the late councillor, Open University lecturer Alan Clark, had had 29 years' service on Nottingham city council, first being elected for the predecessor Byron ward in 1988.  His council career focused on energy and environmental issues, and he was responsible for setting up the UK's first council-owned energy company, the not-for-profit Robin Hood Energy.  Clark's wife Eunice Campbell, another councillor for the ward, survives him.  

Defending Bulwell Forest for Labour is Cheryl Barnard, who runs a property leasing company.  UKIP have reselected Tony Blay who fought the ward in 2015.  The Tory candidate is Karen Kemp, who was runner-up in this ward in the 2003 election as an independent.  Completing the Bulwell Forest ballot paper are Andrew Jones of the Green Party and Callum Southern of the Liberal Democrats.

<h2>Carholme</h2>

Lincoln council; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Karen Lee, who is now MP for Lincoln.  A former nurse at Lincoln County Hospital, Lee had served on Lincoln city council since 2003 and was Mayor of Lincoln in 2012-13.

http://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/linoln-carholme.png

For our second "new MP" by-election of the week we travel east from Nottingham to Lincoln.  The Labour gain of Lincoln was one of those Labour gains which would have come as a complete surprise before the Tory general election campaign hit the rocks, and reflects the fact that Lincoln is not representative of the county to which it gives its name.  Boundary changes confuse the issue here: Carholme was a student ward at the time of the 2011 census, but since then it has seen strong population growth which led to boundary changes for the 2016 election.  The new boundaries saw the University of Lincoln campus transferred to Boultham ward, so the census stats are clearly no longer comparable.  That left Carholme ward entirely north of the River Witham, running west from the city centre (Steep Hill, the High Street and Brayford Pool lie on the ward boundary) along the Carholme Road.  Most of the buildings are Victorian or older, but the ward also includes a rather isolated 21st-century housing estate along Long Leys Road.

Carholme is a traditionally Labour ward, although the Lib Dems gained a seat from Labour in 2007, held it at the 2008 election and were only seven votes away from defeating Lee in 2010 on a general election turnout.  After that the Lib Dem vote in Carholme melted away and their seat was regained by Labour in 2012.  In 2016 - the only previous contest on these boundaries - Labour beat the Conservatives here 57-20.  Over the last twelve years the area has also consistently returned Labour councillors to Lincolnshire county council, which has its main offices in the ward.

Defending for Labour is Lucinda Preston, head of English at Carre's Grammar School in Sleaford, who fought the Lincolnshire Police and Crime Commissioner election in 2016.  The Conservatives have reselected Kateryna Roures Salvador, a University of Lincoln student who fought the ward in 2016 and the Carholme county seat in May.  Also standing are Benjamin Loryman for the Greens and James Brown for the Lib Dems.

<h2>Astley Mosley Common</h2>

Wigan council; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Joanne Platt, who is now MP for Leigh.  She had served since 2012.

http://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/wigan-astley-mosley-common.png

For our North West by-election we are on the Lancashire coalfield.  Roughly halfway between Wigan and Manchester, Astley takes its name from the Old English for "eastern clearing", due to its location to the east of Leigh.  This was one of the main centres of the Lancashire coalfield: over twenty pits were sunk in Astley and its twin town of Tyldesley.  Astley Green Colliery was the last of these to close, in 1970, and its site next to the Bridgewater Canal is preserved as a museum with Lancashire's last remaining pit headgear.  A landmark for those passing by on the East Lancashire Road, which since the 1930s has provided a fast road link from here to central Manchester, although the advent of the misguided bus and the strange things Salford council have done to the Crescent have rather reduced that advantage in recent years.   Nonetheless Astley has a Manchester postcode (M29) and has attracted some commuters as one of the more fashionable parts of the Leigh constituency.  Much of the acreage of the ward south of the East Lancs Road is taken up by Chat Moss, still a desolate peat bog into which few venture.

This ward was created in 2004 out of the former Bedford-Astley and Tyldesley East wards, which were both rock-solid Labour, so it must have been a shock when the 2004 election returned just one Labour councillor to two Liberal Democrats.  The Lib Dems held a seat in 2006 but lost a seat to Labour in 2007, finishing third behind the Conservatives.  The Tories built on that good performance to gain the ward in 2008, meaning that Astley Mosley Common had voted for all three main parties in as many years.

Labour narrowly gained the remaining Lib Dem seat in 2010, and then the advent of Coalition led to a sharp drop in the Tory vote and the disappearance of the Lib Dem vote.  Joanne Platt duly regained the Tory seat in 2012 with a vote share of 70%, and was re-elected in 2016 with 51% of the vote to 24% each for the Tories and UKIP.  In May's Greater Manchester mayoral election Andy Burnham, outgoing Labour MP for this ward, beat the Tory candidate here 69-22.

Defending for Labour is Paula Wakefield, a caseworker in Platt's constituency office who got into politics through campaigning about contaminated blood.  The Conservative candidate is David Stirzaker, a local resident who fought the ward in 2015; he is a boatmaster on the canals and a trustee of the Astley Youth brass band.  UKIP have selected local resident Alan Hogg.  Completing the ballot paper are Andy Prentice for the Green Party and Stuart Thomas for the Liberal Democrats.

<h2>Seaton</h2>

Hartlepool council, County Durham; caused by the resignation of independent councillor Paul Thompson due to work commitments.  He had served since 2010.

http://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/hartlepool-seaton.png

They say you should save the best till last, and for this week's column that is most certainly the casex.  Welcome to Seaton Carew, known to the wider world for three things: the Hartlepool nuclear power station, the controversial Able UK shipbreaking facility, and the curious case of John Darwin, who faked his own death in a canoeing accident here in 2002.

That's a completely unfair description for a lovely place.  Let's start again.  Welcome to Seaton Carew, known to the wider world for three things: its wide sandy beach, for being developed as a seaside resort for Quakers from Darlington, and for the Teesmouth nature reserve.  This is an area of sand dunes, marsh and mudflats where lapwings, curlew, wading birds and seals thrive against the most industrial backdrop imaginable (think Blade Runner with seals, and then remember that Ridley Scott went to college in Hartlepool).  Yes, there really are seals at Seal Sands, don't let anyone tell you otherwise.

http://s0.geograph.org.uk/photos/77/50/775091_d5c34e57.jpg

The beach at Seaton is of high quality and deserves to be better known.  There's history in that beach: a submerged forest lies along the shoreline, the wreck of a collier brig appears out of the sands every so often, and each high tide washes up some coal from an open seam out to sea.  (Don't worry, there's plenty of beach left!)  Some people still make a living collecting seacoal from the beach at Seaton.  Recent regeneration work has demolished some of the more dilapidated shelters on the seafront, but the 1938 Art Deco bus station has survived and is a bit of a hidden gem.  And it's not just the bathing that brings tourists: Seaton Carew golf club, opened in 1874 as England's tenth-oldest club, is described as one of the most challenging links courses in the British Isles, and in 2014 hosted the Brabazon Trophy - England's premier men's amateur strokeplay championship.

For all this tourism, this is Teesside and it's industry that brings money into the place.  The golf club got a windfall in the 1970s thanks to the construction of the Ekofisk gas pipeline across its land from the North Sea gas fields to the Teesside Refinery at Greatham.  The power station and Able UK have already been mentioned; next to them was a zinc smelter (appropriately at the end of Zinc Works Road) whose site is now occupied by Frutarom, a company making chemicals for the food industry.  The chemicals don't end there: next to them is the Tioxide works at Greatham, where my father once had a job.  (The staff smoking area was known as "Oxygen Corner", for reasons which may be obvious if you ever go there.)  On the landward side of the railway line is the Hartlepool Pipe Mill, the UK's largest steel pipe mills, recently sold by Tata Steel in a transaction which will create 100 new jobs.  With all this heavy industry, it's no surprise to see that Seaton ward - on its 2011 boundaries - made the top 40 wards in England and Wales for apprenticeship qualifications.  Boundary changes introduced in 2012 expanded the ward west of the railway line into very deprived parts of the old Fens and Rossmere wards.

Have I sold Seaton Carew to you yet?  You really must go.  If you're still not convinced then, remembering this is supposed to be a piece about local by-elections, have a look at Seaton's politics which are like Hartlepool's politics as a whole: fragmented and thoroughly weird.  At the first election to Hartlepool as a unitary borough in 1995 it elected two Labour councillors and an Independent Conservative.  One of the Labour councillors, Cath Hill, sought re-election in 1998 as an independent, losing her seat to the Conservatives; but got back in 1999 by picking up the Independent Conservative seat.  The Conservatives gained a second seat from Labour in 2000, an election where Labour lost control of Hartlepool council due to an apparent electoral pact between the Tories and Liberal Democrats.  In retrospect, it was at this point - more than two years before the Monkey Mayor Stuart Drummond came on the scene - that Hartlepool's local politics started to get strange.  Labour got a seat back in 2002, defeating the Conservatives, but that was the last time that Seaton voted Labour.

Boundary changes in 2004 saw all three seats up for election, and Seaton ward elected two independent councillors, Mike Turner and Cath Hill, and one Conservative, seafront chippy owner David Young who narrowly held off UKIP; Turner was the outgoing Labour councillor and clearly had a huge personal vote.  Young lost the Conservative seat to a third independent, Paul Thompson, in 2010.

All three independents - Turner, Thompson and Hill - were re-elected in 2012 on the present, expanded boundaries.  Mike Turner resigned shortly afterwards to care for his wife, and the by-election was won easily by Kelly Atkinson, standing for a localist slate called Putting Hartlepool First.  Cath Hill died shortly before the 2014 local elections, leaving her seat open, and it was gained by UKIP in a fragmented result: 30% for UKIP, 25% for independent candidate Sue Little, 20% for Putting Hartlepool First and 17% for Labour.  Thompson was re-elected in 2015 in an even more fragmented result, with majorities of 18 votes over UKIP and 36 votes over Labour: vote shares that year were just 24.1% for Thompson, 23.6% for UKIP, 23.2% for Labour and 13% each for the Conservatives and Little.  At the most recent election in 2016 Putting Hartlepool First held their seat and you'll not be surprised to hear that the result was fragmented: they had 28% to 26% for Little, 23% for UKIP and 13% for Labour.  Since the EU referendum win UKIP's electoral performance has been generally appalling at every level of government, but the party has a long and relatively impressive track record in Hartlepool, even gaining a by-election in the town in October 2016 which was after the referendum.  It will be interesting to see if the relatively good Kipper organisation here can stop the rot.

To take the five candidates in order of the most recent election, Putting Hartlepool First have nominated Leisa Smith who runs a catering company.  Sue Little, another businesswoman who launched a dial-a-ride bus service in Hartlepool this year, is hoping that it will be fourth time lucky for her as an independent candidate.  The UKIP candidate is Karen King.  Labour have selected Ann Marshall, a former Hartlepool councillor (Rossmere ward, 2004-12) who stood here in the 2012 by-election and stood in Fens and Rossmere ward last year.  Completing the ballot paper is Conservative candidate Mike Young.  Goodness knows what will happen here, but at this stage possibly the safest prediction is that we can expect another win on a low share of the vote.
