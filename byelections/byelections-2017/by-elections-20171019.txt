"All the right votes, but not necessarily in the right order"

Like the first two Thursdays of the month, 19th October 2017 sees eight by-elections, but it could have been more.  There was a ninth by-election scheduled for today in the Haseley Brook ward of South Oxfordshire district, but when nominations closed the Conservatives' Caroline Newton was the only candidate and she has therefore been elected unopposed.  This column sends its congratulations to Councillor Newton.  Of the eight remaining seats up for election this week, there are five Labour defences (three of which are in the city of Nottingham), two Conservative defences and an independent seat up for election.  Three of the Labour vacancies arise from newly-elected MPs leaving their council seats behind to concentrate on Westminster; as they join the ranks of the Commons we start this week by paying tribute to one former MP who has recently left us.

<h2>Lower Sheering</h2>

Epping Forest council, Essex; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Gary Waller at the age of 72.

One of the few councillors notable enough to merit his own Wikipedia page, Waller was a Conservative MP throughout the Thatcher and Major administrations.  He gained the marginal seat of Brighouse and Spenborough from Labour in 1979, and when that seat was abolished in the 1983 boundary changes gained the Keighley seat from Labour, holding it until 1997.  Waller never got off the backbenches, but during the 1992 Parliament was chairman of the House of Commons Information Committee, which oversaw Parliamentary IT and the House of Commons Library.  The Major administration was never short of scandal, and Waller's contribution to that was to have an affair - resulting in a son - with Sir Marcus Fox' secretary.  Waller moved from Yorkshire to Essex after his parliamentary career ended, being elected to Epping Forest council in 2011 and serving as chairman of the Harlow branch of the Conservative party.  Away from politics his interests included history and his collection of Jaguar cars.
