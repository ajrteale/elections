Aldwick West

Arun council, West Sussex; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Jacquie Maconachie.  One of the longest serving Arun councillors, she was first elected in 1995 and was chairman of Arun council in 2001-02.  She leaves behind her husband Dougal - also an Arun councillor - a daughter, a son, five grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.

We start this week both alphabetically and geographically on the south coast.  West Sussex' population can be divdided fairly neatly into two halves, a landward half and a coastal half.  The coastal half consists of a series of seaside towns running all the way from Brighton to Bognor Regis.  Directly to the west of Bognor lies the parish of Aldwick which is entirely built-up and a part of Bognor in all but name.  

Aldwick's development started in 1929, the year Bognor gained its "Regis" suffix from George V, with the building of the Aldwick Bay Estate: interesting period houses behind the seafront for seriously wealthy Londoners who wanted a second home on the seaside.  The estate was so exclusive that the dustbin men were required to wear ties.  Rose Green - added to the ward in boundary changes in 2015 - also dates fom the 1930s, while most of the housing in between is postwar.

The smaller towns on the Sussex coast have a reputation as retirement centres, and Aldwick West ward is no exception: on its 2011 boundaries it made the top 60 wards in England and Wales for population aged 65 or over, with over 30% of the population being retired.  Pension day must be fun in the local post office.

As the profile might suggest this is a safe Conservative ward.  In 2015 the Tory slate beat UKIP here 52-30, although Maconachie was a long way behind her running-mate Philip Hitchins.  May's county elections saw the Conseratives win both of the county seats covering the ward, gaining Bognor Regis West and Aldwick from the Liberal Democrats.

Defending for the Conservatives is Guy Purser, a consultant for a dry ice cleaning company and chairman of the Bognor Freemasons Hall.  UKIP have not nominated a candidate, so Purser is opposed by Martin Smith for the Liberal Democrats, Carol Birch for the Green Party and Ian Manion for Labour.

Beaconsfield (Buckinghamshire county council); and
Beaconsfield North (South Bucks council)

Both caused by the death of Conservative councillor Alan Walters at the age of 71.  Known for his community work - for he was appointed MBE in 2015 - Walters was first elected to South Bucks council in a December 2001 by-election, serving as the council's chairman from 2010 to 2013, and was also Mayor of Beaconsfield in 2004.  He had only served on Buckinghamshire county council for four months, having been first elected to County Hall in May.

To get our remaining two safe Conservative defences out of the way, we come to the Chiltern hills and the town of Beaconsfield.  On the old road from London to Oxford, Beaconsfield has been a market town since mediaeval times; the old part of Beaconsfield, along the Oxford Road, had an economy based on coaching, while in Edwardian times a New Beaconsfield sprang up to the north next to Beaconsfield railway station, along the Chiltern rail line from London Marylebone to Birmingham.  This is the archetypal rich commuter town, and Beaconsfield regularly comes top or near the top of lists of the UK's most expensive places to buy property: according to July 2014-June 2015 figures, the town's median house price is £790,000.  One wonders whether this is proportionally reflected in Bekonscot, built in the 1920s as the world's first model village - as in scale model.

This being Buckinghamshire with its close proximity to Pinewood Studios and other film and TV areas, Beaconsfield is a popular location for filming.  Films from Brief Encounter to Hot Fuzz have been shot here, and Midsomer Murders regularly uses the railway station as a substitute for Causton.  The film and TV link is further cemented by the presence of one of the world's leading film schools, the National Film and Television School, opened in 1971 on the site of a former film studio and still receiving royalties from the first Wallace and Gromit film A Grand Day Out, which was shot here while Nick Park was a student.

In the 2011 census the former Beaconsfield North ward had a majority of the workforce educated to degree level and/or in a management or professional occupation.  Boundary changes in 2015 reduced the size of the ward, removing the areas south of the railway line, but probably didn't change its social composition given that the town's other two wards aren't that much further down the social scale.

The town has an association with Conservatism from the birth of Conservatism as an ideology: Edmund Burke died here in 1797, while twice Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli served for 29 years as an MP for Buckinghamshire before being translated to the House of Lords as the Earl of Beaconsfield.  There is still a Beaconsfield Conservative link in the present House of Commons: Anne Main, the MP for St Albans, was brought up here.  In that context it's no surprise that in the 1982 parliamentary by-election the Labour candidate polled less than one-eighth of the votes and, that being the rule in those days, lost his deposit - he was the man the Labour party loves to hate, Tony Blair.

The most recent local election results confirm that pattern.  In Beaconsfield North ward in 2015 the Conservatives polled 86% in a straight fight with UKIP, while in May's county elections Beaconsfield as a whole saw the Tories beat the Lib Dems 70-16.

Both these by-elections are straight fights between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats.  In the county election the defending Tory candidate is Anita Cranmer, the present Deputy Mayor of Beaconsfield; she is a former schoolteacher and former South Bucks district councillor.  Cranmer is opposed by Lib Dem Mark Skoyles, who gives an address in Marlow.  In the dstrict by-election the defending Conservative candidate, local resident Damian Saunders, is opposed by Liberal Democrat Paul Henry.
