Aldwick West

Arun council, West Sussex; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Jacquie Maconachie.  One of the longest serving Arun councillors, she was first elected in 1995 and was chairman of Arun council in 2001-02.  She leaves behind her husband Dougal - also an Arun councillor - a daughter, a son, five grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.

We start this week both alphabetically and geographically on the south coast.  West Sussex' population can be divdided fairly neatly into two halves, a landward half and a coastal half.  The coastal half consists of a series of seaside towns running all the way from Brighton to Bognor Regis.  Directly to the west of Bognor lies the parish of Aldwick which is entirely built-up and a part of Bognor in all but name.  

Aldwick's development started in 1929, the year Bognor gained its "Regis" suffix from George V, with the building of the Aldwick Bay Estate: interesting period houses behind the seafront for seriously wealthy Londoners who wanted a second home on the seaside.  The estate was so exclusive that the dustbin men were required to wear ties.  Rose Green - added to the ward in boundary changes in 2015 - also dates fom the 1930s, while most of the housing in between is postwar.

The smaller towns on the Sussex coast have a reputation as retirement centres, and Aldwick West ward is no exception: on its 2011 boundaries it made the top 60 wards in England and Wales for population aged 65 or over, with over 30% of the population being retired.  Pension day must be fun in the local post office.

As the profile might suggest this is a safe Conservative ward.  In 2015 the Tory slate beat UKIP here 52-30, although Maconachie was a long way behind her running-mate Philip Hitchins.  May's county elections saw the Conseratives win both of the county seats covering the ward, gaining Bognor Regis West and Aldwick from the Liberal Democrats.

Defending for the Conservatives is Guy Purser, a consultant for a dry ice cleaning company and chairman of the Bognor Freemasons Hall.  UKIP have not nominated a candidate, so Purser is opposed by Martin Smith for the Liberal Democrats, Carol Birch for the Green Party and Ian Manion for Labour.
