MASH BARN

Adur council, West Sussex; caused by the resignation of UKIP councillor David Lambourne.

Where better to start than the first English district council, alphabetically?  The slightly curious name of Adur district comes from a local river, and Mash Barn ward lies on the western bank of that river.  This has always been an outward-looking area: much of the ward's acreage is taken up by Brighton City (Shoreham) Airport, which opened in 1910 as the oldest purpose-built commercial airport in the world; the terminal building is listed for its 1930s Art Deco architecture.  Sold by Adur council in 2006, Brighton City is not one of the UK's most important airports - it handled fewer than 500 passengers in 2014 - but was notable for the annual Shoreham Airshow until a 2015 incident in which an aircraft crashed onto the A27 road on the ward's northern boundary, killing 11 people on the ground.

With much of Mash Barn ward's area taken up by the airport, floodplain or the training grounds for Brighton and Hove Albion FC, the ward's population is concentrated at its western end in the village of Lancing.  One of the many claimants this column comes across for the title of England's largest village, Lancing is effectively a part of the Brighton-Worthing conurbation and easily large enough to be a town in its own right.  Mash Barn is Lancing's council estate ward, running north from the railway station to the A27 road, and has particularly high levels of part-time working.

In recent years Mash Barn's politics have been rather volatile.  The current ward boundaries date from 2004 when the ward's two seats split between the Tories and Lib Dems.  That split persisted, leading to some wild swings in the following years: the Lib Dems held their seat in 2006 by just 5 votes, increased their majority in the 2010 election to 28 votes, but fell to fourth place in 2012 as the Conservatives held their seat easily.  In 2014 the Tory councillor resigned putting both seats in the ward up for election, and both seats were comfortably gained by UKIP.  UKIP held the ward easily in 2016 when they had 42% to 23% for the Conservatives and 20% for Labour.  However, the purple party seem to have fallen apart in Adur recently: they lost the Lancing county council seat, which covers this ward, to the Conservatives in May.

ST GERMAIN'S

Redcar and Cleveland council, North Yorkshire; caused by the death of Liberal Democrat councillor Marjorie Moses.

In a by-election in February 2002 St Germain's ward turned in a result which may well be unique for all time - a Lib Dem gain from Arthur Scargill's Socialist Labour Party.  In that case the Socialist Labour councillor had originally been elected as a Lib Dem.
