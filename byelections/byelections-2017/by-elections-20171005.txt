ST GERMAIN'S

Redcar and Cleveland council, North Yorkshire; caused by the death of Liberal Democrat councillor Marjorie Moses.

In a by-election in February 2002 St Germain's ward turned in a result which may well be unique for all time - a Lib Dem gain from Arthur Scargill's Socialist Labour Party.  In that case the Socialist Labour councillor had originally been elected as a Lib Dem.
