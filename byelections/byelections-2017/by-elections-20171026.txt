Seven by-elections on 26th October 2017:

DROYLSDEN EAST

Tameside council, Greater Manchester; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Jim Middleton, who is retiring after 27 years' service.

We start this week in that greatest of counties, Greater Manchester.  The Tameside district is an agglomeration of small mill towns to the east of Manchester, and Droylsden is the westernmost of them, merging seamlessly into the Manchester urban area just four miles east of the city centre - the town lies within the M60 motorway and has a Manchester postcode, M43.  Droylsden is a classic Lancashire milltown which claims to be the birthplace of the terry towel, machine-woven by W M Christy and Sons in 1851.  Robertson's jam factory, next to the Ashton Canal, was also a major employer.  All this is gone now - the site of Christy's factory is now occupied by a Tesco off Ashton New Road.  That Tesco has clearly badly affected the town's shopping centre, which when your columnist visited a few years ago was a parade of charity shops as bad as anything in Oldham.  The Metrolink came to Droylsden along Ashton New Road in 2013: the town was briefly the terminus of the East Manchester line which now continues to Ashton-under-Lyne.  Droylsden tram stop is within Droylsden East ward, which covers the Fairfield area south of Ashton New Road and also extends north along Market Street and Lumb Lane - in general, the further away you get from Ashton New Road, the nicer the neighbourhood becomes.

There was briefly a Droylsden parliamentary constituency, created in the 1950 redistribution and abolished in 1955, and if the Boundary Commisison get their way something similar could be created for the 2022 election.  The Droylsden constituency was marginal between Labour and the Conservatives in the 1950 and 1951 elections, but the Conservative vote in Tameside has basically fallen apart over the post-war period - the Tories have only one reliable ward in the borough, Stalybridge South - and it's the radical right who have filled the runner-up spot in Droylsden East over the last decade.  The BNP ran second here from 2006 to 2010, and UKIP were runners-up from 2011 to 2015, getting within ten points of Labour in 2014.  At Middleton's last re-election in 2016 his lead over UKIP was 51-34.

This by-election will see a change to that pattern, as there is no UKIP candidate this time.  Defending for Labour is local resident David Mills, who is opposed by Matt Stevenson for the Tories, Jean Smee for the Greens and Shaun Offerman for the Lib Dems.
