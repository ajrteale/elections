Seven by-elections on 26th October 2017:

DROYLSDEN EAST

Tameside council, Greater Manchester; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Jim Middleton, who is retiring after 27 years' service.

We start this week in that greatest of counties, Greater Manchester.  The Tameside district is an agglomeration of small mill towns to the east of Manchester, and Droylsden is the westernmost of them, merging seamlessly into the Manchester urban area just four miles east of the city centre - the town lies within the M60 motorway and has a Manchester postcode, M43.  Droylsden is a classic Lancashire milltown which claims to be the birthplace of the terry towel, machine-woven by W M Christy and Sons in 1851.  Robertson's jam factory, next to the Ashton Canal, was also a major employer.  All this is gone now - the site of Christy's factory is now occupied by a Tesco off Ashton New Road.  That Tesco and the proximity to the big city has clearly badly affected the town's shopping centre, which when your columnist visited a few years ago was a parade of charity shops as bad as anything in Oldham.  The Metrolink came to Droylsden along Ashton New Road in 2013: the town was briefly the terminus of the East Manchester line which now continues to Ashton-under-Lyne.  Droylsden tram stop is within Droylsden East ward, which covers the Fairfield area south of Ashton New Road and also extends north along Market Street and Lumb Lane - in general, the further away you get from Ashton New Road, the nicer the neighbourhood becomes.

There was briefly a Droylsden parliamentary constituency, created in the 1950 redistribution and abolished in 1955, and if the Boundary Commisison get their way something similar could be created for the 2022 election.  The Droylsden constituency was marginal between Labour and the Conservatives in the 1950 and 1951 elections, but the Conservative vote in Tameside has basically fallen apart over the post-war period - the Tories have only one reliable ward in the borough, Stalybridge South - and it's the radical right who have filled the runner-up spot in Droylsden East over the last decade.  The BNP ran second here from 2006 to 2010, and UKIP were runners-up from 2011 to 2015, getting within ten points of Labour in 2014.  At Middleton's last re-election in 2016 his lead over UKIP was 51-34.

This by-election will see a change to that pattern, as there is no UKIP candidate this time.  Defending for Labour is local resident David Mills, who is opposed by Matt Stevenson for the Tories, Jean Smee for the Greens and Shaun Offerman for the Lib Dems.

BATLEY EAST

Kirklees council, West Yorkshire; caused by the disqualification of former Labour councillor Amanda Stubley, who failed to attend any council meetings in six months.  She had served since 2011.

We move over to the wrong side of the Pennines to another smallish industrial town, although one very different in character from Droylsden.  Like Droyslden, Batley is a textile town, but the industry here was shoddy - that is, recycled wool rags and clothes.  Unlike Droylsden, which has been relatively little touched by immigration over the decades, Batley attracted large numbers of people from the subcontinent (particularly Gujarat and the Punjab) from the late 1950s to work in the town's textile mills.  Batley East ward - based on the town centre and including its railway station - now has a majority Asian and a majority Muslim population, and there are significant proportions of Gujurati speakers and people born in India or Pakistan.

Textiles are still important to the local economy - one of the local mills has been done up as The Mill, a factory outlet attracting people from all over West Yorkshire - but the largest single employer in the town is Fox's Biscuits, whose head office and main factory is here.  Monty Python fans may remember the Batley Ladies Townswomen's Guild, but Batley was known for more professional performances than that: Batley Variety Club was a major draw to punters and artists from all over the world, with in its heyday such well-known American acts as Louis Armstrong, Roy Orbison and Neil Sedaka treading its boards.  However, the club finally closed its doors to live music in 2016, and a gym opened in the building earlier this year.  One famous musician from Batley was the late Robert Palmer, while the town has also given us a Nobel laureate, the IVF pioneer Sir Robert Edwards, and the late and much-lamented MP Jo Cox.

This is a safe Labour ward in current political conditions, although the Liberal Democrats did win a seat in the ward in 2003.  Boundary changes in 2004 knocked the Lib Dem councillor out and it has generally been plain sailing for Labour since then.  At the most recent local election in 2016 - before the parliamentary by-election and snap general election - Labour beat the Conservatives here 70-12.

Defending for Labour is Habiban Zaman, an immigrant from Pakistan who is a community worker and was awarded the British Empire Medal in the 2014 Birthday Honours for outstanding services to women.  The Conservative candidate is Paul Young, from Batley, and also standing are the Liberal Democrats' Jon Bloom (the Lib Dem councillor here from 2003 to 2004; he has fought the ward on several occasions since losing his seat and gone backwards nearly every time), David Smith of the Green Party and Aleks Lukic, who was the UKIP candidate for Batley and Spen in the 2015 general election, fought that seat as an independent in June and is now standing with the description "The Local Independents - Heavy Woollen District".
