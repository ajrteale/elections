Ten by-elections on 23rd November 2017:

Perth City South

Perth and Kinross council; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Michael Jamieson who had served only since May.  He has been charged with possession of indecent images of children.

Welcome to the Fair City of Perth, gateway to the Highlands and the northern end of the UK's motorway network: the M90 terminates here.  Strategically located at head of the Tay estuary and the junction of major roads and railway lines to Dundee, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Inverness, Perth has been a major city since the 12th century when King William the Lion gave it the status of a Royal Burgh.  Perth benefited from its closeness to Scone Abbey, one of the centres of the Scottish monarchy, to become a major port trading with continential Europe.  Industry came in the eighteenth century with the founding of Perth Academy, and the city became and remains a major railway junction.  Today there is a diverse economy with a major financial services presence: the largest employers are the local council and the bus company Stagecoach, which is based here, and the city (formally re-created as such for the Diamond Jubilee in 2012) is a major service centre for the local area.

For electoral purposes the city is divided into three wards, with Perth City South electing four councillors by proportional representation.  This is the south-west of the city to the west of the railway line, running along the Glasgow Road to the Broxden Roundabout and including the Friarton area to the south.  Boundary changes in May this year expanded the ward slightly to the north.  This is by a long way the least deprived of Perth's three wards.

The ward's politics are dominated by Liberal Democrat councillor Willie Wilson who has a large personal vote and has topped the poll here at every election since PR was introduced in 2007.  In that year Wilson got a running-mate elected, to one seat each for the Conservatives and SNP.  The Lib Dems lost their second seat to Labour in 2012.  In May this year the Liberal Democrats topped the poll with 35%, to 26% for the SNP, 25% for the Conservatives and just 6% for Labour, who were defending a seat; despite picking up most of the Lib Dem and Tory surpluses, that was too far back for Labour to catch the second SNP candidate.  That made 2 seats for the SNP to one each for the Lib Dems and Conservatives.  The by-election is unlikely to affect control of the council, which is run by a coalition of the Conservatives, Lib Dems and independents.

Despite the Tory near-miss in June's general election here, when they finished just 21 votes behind the SNP in Perth and North Perthshire, this will be a very difficult defence starting from third place and considering the circumstances of this by-election.  Their defending candidate on a rare all-female ballot paper of six candidates is Audrey Coates, a businesswoman whose husband Harry is councillor for Perth City North ward.  Also keeping it in the family are the Liberal Democrats: their candidate Liz Barrett, who runs a consultancy business, is married to the group leader Peter Barrett.  The SNP have selected Pauline Leitch, a former police officer and community councillor.  Also standing are Tricia Duncan for Labour, independent candidate Denise Baykal and Elspeth Maclachlan of the Scottish Green Party.

Rutherglen Central and North

South Lanarkshire council; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Ged Killen, who is now the MP for Rutherglen and Hamilton West.  He had served on South Lanarkshire council since winning a by-election to Rutherglen South ward in February 2013, transferring to this ward in May.

For our second Scottish by-election of the week we are in Greater Glasgow.  Rutherglen was in fact part of Glasgow from 1975 to 1996, until it regained independence as part of South Lanarkshire district.  The ward is bisected by the West Coast Main Line and the recently-completed M74 motorway; south of these lie the town centre and main shopping district, while to the north next to the River Clyde lies a former heavy industrial area.  Here can be found Shawfield, former home of Clyde FC and now Scotland's only venue for greyhound racing.  However, Shawfield's money came not from sport but from chemicals: the local chemical works supplied the majority of the UK's chromium products, leading to a legacy of contamination which has taken decades to clean up.  Before the dangers were properly realised, Greggs sited their main Scottish bakery here.  It should be no surprise from this description that this is a seriously deprived area.

Created in 2007, Rutherglen Central and North ward elected two Labour councillors and one SNP councillor that year, and re-elected them in 2012.  Ged Killen's by-election gain of Rutherglen South ward in 2013 had given Labour an overall majority on South Lanarkshire council, which was never likely to withstand the SNP poll surge following the 2014 independence referendum.  Labour put up two new candidates in Central and North for the 2017 election including Killen, but didn't hold their second seat: the SNP topped the poll with 39%, to 31% for Labour and 16% for the Conservatives, who benefited from Unionist transfers to gain the second Labour seat.  As in Perth, this seat was a photofinish in June's general election with Killen enjoying a majority of 265 votes; and the SNP now have the dubious pleasure of running a minority administration on South Lanarkshire council with just 25 out of 64 seats.

Defending for Labour is Martin Lennon who was Killen's running-mate in May but polled a long way behind him.  The SNP candidate is David Innes who gives an address a long way up the M74 in Stonehouse.  The Conservatives have selected Taylor Muir who isn't yet 23 but already has the experience of an electoral veteran: he fought Rutherglen and Hamilton West in the 2015 general election and Rutherglen in the 2016 Holyrood election.  Also standing are Ellen Bryson for the Liberal Democrats, Brian Finlay for the Scottish Greens and Janice Mackay for UKIP.

Wakefield West

Wakefield council, West Yorkshire; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Ryan Case who had served since 2015.

Moving over the Tees into Yorkshire, we travel south to the city of Wakefield.  An ancient market town which in 1888 became a city and headquarters of the old West Riding county council, Wakefield suffered all the usual problems from the collapse of its traditional industries (coalmining, glassmaking and textiles); transport and distribution has become a major industry thanks to the city's proximity to the M1 motorway.

The Wakefield West ward's boundaries can be simply stated: it lies south of the Dewsbury Road, east of M1 motorway, north of the River Calder and west of the city centre.  The main area of population is Lupset, a large inter-war council estate; smaller communities in the ward include Thornes to the south and Clayton Hill near the centre - an area with significant Polish and Pakistani populations.  Thornes is notable for an athletics stadium, home to Wakefield Harriers, and as the birthplace of the fomer Archbishop of York David Hope, who later became a member of the House of Lords in his own right as Lord Hope of Thornes.

Despite being a deprived council estate ward Wakefield West was solidly Conservative-voting until the advent of Coalition.  Labour cut the Conservative majority to 180 votes in 2010 (on a general election turnout) and just 48 votes in 2011 before finally breaking through in 2012.  Since 2015 the ward has had a full slate of Labour councillors, and the 2017 parliamentary election saw only a very small swing to the Conservatives across the marginal Wakefield constituency.  At the most recent local elections in 2016 Labour led the Conservatives here 49-30.

Defending for Labour is Michael Graham, who describes himself on Twitter as a teacher, school governor, volunteer and tennis enthusiast.  The Conservative candidate is Dawn Hunt who is the only candidate to give an address in the ward.  Completing the ballot paper are Peter Williams for the Liberal Democrats and Paul Phelps for the Yorkshire Party.

Eyres Monsell

Leicester council; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Rory Palmer, who has been promoted to the European Parliament to replace retiring MEP Dame Glenis Wilmott.  He had served since 2007.

Further down the M1 we come to Leicester and to a ward with very similar demographics to Wakefield West.  Eyres Monsell is the southernmost ward of the city of Leicester, although that doesn't mean it's the most southerly ward in the Leicester built-up area; the ward merges seamlessly into the suburbs of Glen Parva to the west and South Wigston to the east which are most definitely not Leicester.  The ward name commemorates Bolton Eyres-Monsell, the first Viscount Monsell, who served for 25 years as Conservative MP for Evesham, was Conservative chief whip during the turbulent 1920s and later First Lord of the Admiralty.  Lord Monsell had some interesting links with travel and exploration: he was the uncle of the Arctic explorer Gino Watkins and father-in-law of Sir Patrick Leigh Fermor.

Leicester city council compulsory purchased Monsell's land in 1950 in order to build a council estate on it.  The ward named after him is one of the areas of Leicester which has been least changed by immigation, with a 95% White British population.  Unemployment is high and all of the ward's census districts score very badly on the deprivation indices.

Politically this ward has been Labour since 2007, when a Lib Dem administration on the city council was almost wiped out - in the 2007 election the Lib Dems actually finished fourth behind Labour, the Conservatives and the BNP.  The BNP score that year was 21%, showing potential for the populist right, and UKIP cashed in on that to finish second here in the 2015 election.  Shares of the vote in 2015 were 43% for Labour, 26% for UKIP and 18% for the Conservatives.

Defending for Labour is Elaine Pantling, an actress who runs a one-woman theatre company.  UKIP have not returned to the fray.  The Conservative candidate is Christopher Doyle, a student at De Montfort University.  Completing the ballot paper is Tony Faithfull-Wright of the Liberal Democrats.
