Ten by-elections on 23rd November 2017:

Perth City South

Perth and Kinross council; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Michael Jamieson who had served only since May.  He has been charged with possession of indecent images of children.

Welcome to the Fair City of Perth, gateway to the Highlands and the northern end of the UK's motorway network: the M90 terminates here.  Strategically located at head of the Tay estuary and the junction of major roads and railway lines to Dundee, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Inverness, Perth has been a major city since the 12th century when King William the Lion gave it the status of a Royal Burgh.  Perth benefited from its closeness to Scone Abbey, one of the centres of the Scottish monarchy, to become a major port trading with continential Europe.  Industry came in the eighteenth century with the founding of Perth Academy, and the city became and remains a major railway junction.  Today there is a diverse economy with a major financial services presence: the largest employers are the local council and the bus company Stagecoach, which is based here, and the city (formally re-created as such for the Diamond Jubilee in 2012) is a major service centre for the local area.

For electoral purposes the city is divided into three wards, with Perth City South electing four councillors by proportional representation.  This is the south-west of the city to the west of the railway line, running along the Glasgow Road to the Broxden Roundabout and including the Friarton area to the south.  Boundary changes in May this year expanded the ward slightly to the north.  This is by a long way the least deprived of Perth's three wards.

The ward's politics are dominated by Liberal Democrat councillor Willie Wilson who has a large personal vote and has topped the poll here at every election since PR was introduced in 2007.  In that year Wilson got a running-mate elected, to one seat each for the Conservatives and SNP.  The Lib Dems lost their second seat to Labour in 2012.  In May this year the Liberal Democrats topped the poll with 35%, to 26% for the SNP, 25% for the Conservatives and just 6% for Labour, who were defending a seat; despite picking up most of the Lib Dem and Tory surpluses, that was too far back for Labour to catch the second SNP candidate.  That made 2 seats for the SNP to one each for the Lib Dems and Conservatives.  The by-election is unlikely to affect control of the council, which is run by a coalition of the Conservatives, Lib Dems and independents.

Despite the Tory near-miss in June's general election here, when they finished just 21 votes behind the SNP in Perth and North Perthshire, this will be a very difficult defence starting from third place and considering the circumstances of this by-election.  Their defending candidate, on a rare all-female ballot paper of six candidates, is Audrey Coates, a businesswoman whose husband Harry is councillor for Perth City North ward.  Also keeping it in the family are the Liberal Democrats: their candidate Liz Barrett, who runs a consultancy business, is married to the group leader Peter Barrett.  The SNP have selected Pauline Leitch, a former police officer and community councillor.  Also standing are Tricia Duncan for Labour, independent candidate Denise Baykal and Elspeth Maclachlan of the Scottish Green Party.  A quick reminder that, this being a Scottish local election, the Alternative Vote will be used in this by-election and those aged 16 and 17 are eligible to vote.

Rutherglen Central and North

South Lanarkshire council; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Ged Killen, who is now the MP for Rutherglen and Hamilton West.  He had served on South Lanarkshire council since winning a by-election to Rutherglen South ward in February 2013, transferring to this ward in May.

For our second Scottish by-election of the week we are in Greater Glasgow.  Rutherglen was in fact part of Glasgow from 1975 to 1996, until it regained independence as part of South Lanarkshire district.  The ward is bisected by the West Coast Main Line and the recently-completed M74 motorway; south of these lie the town centre and main shopping district, while to the north next to the River Clyde lies a former heavy industrial area.  Here can be found Shawfield, former home of Clyde FC and now Scotland's only venue for greyhound racing.  However, Shawfield's money came not from sport but from chemicals: the local chemical works supplied the majority of the UK's chromium products, leading to a legacy of contamination which has taken decades to clean up.  Before the dangers were properly realised, Greggs sited their main Scottish bakery here.  It should be no surprise from this description that this is a seriously deprived area.

Created in 2007, Rutherglen Central and North ward elected two Labour councillors and one SNP councillor that year, and re-elected them in 2012.  Ged Killen's by-election gain of Rutherglen South ward in 2013 had given Labour an overall majority on South Lanarkshire council, which was never likely to withstand the SNP poll surge following the 2014 independence referendum.  Labour put up two new candidates in Central and North for the 2017 election including Killen, but didn't hold their second seat: the SNP topped the poll with 39%, to 31% for Labour and 16% for the Conservatives, who benefited from Unionist transfers to gain the second Labour seat.  As in Perth, this seat was a photofinish in June's general election with Killen enjoying a majority of 265 votes; and the SNP now have the dubious pleasure of running a minority administration on South Lanarkshire council with just 25 out of 64 seats.

Defending for Labour is Martin Lennon who was Killen's running-mate in May but polled a long way behind him.  The SNP candidate is David Innes who gives an address a long way up the M74 in Stonehouse.  The Conservatives have selected Taylor Muir who isn't yet 23 but already has the experience of an electoral veteran: he fought Rutherglen and Hamilton West in the 2015 general election and Rutherglen in the 2016 Holyrood election.  Also standing are Ellen Bryson for the Liberal Democrats, Brian Finlay for the Scottish Greens and Janice Mackay for UKIP.

Wakefield West

Wakefield council, West Yorkshire; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Ryan Case who had served since 2015.

Moving over the Tees into Yorkshire, we travel south to the city of Wakefield.  An ancient market town which in 1888 became a city and headquarters of the old West Riding county council, Wakefield suffered all the usual problems from the collapse of its traditional industries (coalmining, glassmaking and textiles); transport and distribution has become a major industry thanks to the city's proximity to the M1 motorway.

The Wakefield West ward's boundaries can be simply stated: it lies south of the Dewsbury Road, east of M1 motorway, north of the River Calder and west of the city centre.  The main area of population is Lupset, a large inter-war council estate; smaller communities in the ward include Thornes to the south and Clayton Hill near the centre - an area with significant Polish and Pakistani populations.  Thornes is notable for an athletics stadium, home to Wakefield Harriers, and as the birthplace of the fomer Archbishop of York David Hope, who later became a member of the House of Lords in his own right as Lord Hope of Thornes.

Despite being a deprived council estate ward Wakefield West was solidly Conservative-voting until the advent of Coalition.  Labour cut the Conservative majority to 180 votes in 2010 (on a general election turnout) and just 48 votes in 2011 before finally breaking through in 2012.  Since 2015 the ward has had a full slate of Labour councillors, and the 2017 parliamentary election saw only a very small swing to the Conservatives across the marginal Wakefield constituency.  At the most recent local elections in 2016 Labour led the Conservatives here 49-30.

Defending for Labour is Michael Graham, who describes himself on Twitter as a teacher, school governor, volunteer and tennis enthusiast.  The Conservative candidate is Dawn Hunt who is the only candidate to give an address in the ward.  Completing the ballot paper are Peter Williams for the Liberal Democrats and Paul Phelps for the Yorkshire Party.

Eyres Monsell

Leicester council; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Rory Palmer, who has been promoted to the European Parliament to replace retiring MEP Dame Glenis Wilmott.  He had served since 2007.

Further down the M1 we come to Leicester and to a ward with very similar demographics to Wakefield West.  Eyres Monsell is the southernmost ward of the city of Leicester, although that doesn't mean it's the most southerly ward in the Leicester built-up area; the ward merges seamlessly into the suburbs of Glen Parva to the west and South Wigston to the east which are most definitely not Leicester.  The ward name commemorates Bolton Eyres-Monsell, the first Viscount Monsell, who served for 25 years as Conservative MP for Evesham, was Conservative chief whip during the turbulent 1920s and later First Lord of the Admiralty.  Lord Monsell had some interesting links with travel and exploration: he was the uncle of the Arctic explorer Gino Watkins and father-in-law of Sir Patrick Leigh Fermor.

Leicester city council compulsory purchased Monsell's land in 1950 in order to build a council estate on it.  The ward named after him is one of the areas of Leicester which has been least changed by immigation, with a 95% White British population.  Unemployment is high and all of the ward's census districts score very badly on the deprivation indices.

Politically this ward has been Labour since 2007, when a Lib Dem administration on the city council was almost wiped out - in the 2007 election the Lib Dems actually finished fourth behind Labour, the Conservatives and the BNP.  The BNP score that year was 21%, showing potential for the populist right, and UKIP cashed in on that to finish second here in the 2015 election.  Shares of the vote in 2015 were 43% for Labour, 26% for UKIP and 18% for the Conservatives.

Defending for Labour is Elaine Pantling, an actress who runs a one-woman theatre company.  UKIP have not returned to the fray.  The Conservative candidate is Christopher Doyle, a student at De Montfort University.  Completing the ballot paper is Tony Faithfull-Wright of the Liberal Democrats.

Bryn-côch South

Neath Port Talbot council, Glamorgan; caused by the death of Plaid Cymru councillor Janice Dudley who had served since 2004.

For our Welsh by-election this week we come to the Vale of Neath.  Bryn-côch South ward lies on the north bank of the River Neath opposite Neath itself; this is one of the relatively better-off parts of Neath Port Talbot although it does include the Caewern council estate.  Bryncoch has an association with the evolutionary scientist Alfred Russell Wallace, who lived here for a time while working as a surveyor for the Great Western Railway.

Since 1999 this division has been closely fought between Labour and Plaid Cymru, with the parties sharing the two seats in the 1999 and 2012 elections.  In May the Tories, Lib Dems and Greens stood for the first time since the ward was created in 1983, and Labour were most affected by this expansion: Plaid won with 45%, to just 24% for Labour and 19% for the Conservatives.

Defending for Plaid Cymru is Jo Hale, vice-chair of the local Blaenhonddan community council.  In a ballot paper with a majority of double-barrelled surnames, Labour have reselected Emma Denholm-Hall who fought the seat in May.  The Conservative candidate is Peter Crocker-Jacques, who fought Neath in the 2016 Senedd election and a few months later got four (4) votes in a council by-election in Blaengwrach further up the valley; this should be better territory for him than Blaengwrach.  Completing the ballot paper are Sheila Kingston-Jones for the Liberal Democrats and Darren Thomas for UKIP.

Bishops Frome and Cradley

Herefordshire council; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Patricia Morgan, who intends to sail around the world with her husband Julian.  She was first elected in 2007 for Frome ward and had served for this ward since 2015.

After six urban wards, it's time for a change of scene as we come to four wards in the English countryside.  They don't get much more rural than Bishops Frome and Cradley, a group of six parishes on the Herefordshire/Worcestershire border which essentially fill the space between the Malvern Hills and Bromyard.  Despite the order of names, the largest parish within the ward is Cradley with 1526 electors, more than the rest of the ward put together; the smallest parish in the ward, Evesbatch, has just 60 electors.

Bishops Frome and Cradley ward was created for the 2015 election and has no direct predecessor.  At the time of the 2011 census Cradley parish anchored Hope End ward, which seems to have attracted some commuters to Malvern and Worcester, while the rest of the area was covered by Frome and Bromyard wards.  Judging from the stats for those wards Bishops Frome and Cradley has a relatively old age profile with high levels of self-employment; typical for a deeply rural area.

Rural Herefordshire tends to be a contest between Conservatives and independents.  No independent candidate came forward in Bishops Frome and Cradley ward in 2015, but the Conservatives were opposed by the Green Party and beat them 69-31.

This by-election has a wider field of candidates.  Defending for the Conservatives is Robert Carter, who lives in the ward in the village of Acton Beauchamp.  He is opposed by three candidates who fought the North Herefordshire constituency in June's general election: Ellie Chowns for the Green Party, Jeanie Falconer for the Liberal Democrats and Roger Page for Labour.

Chalford

Stroud council, Gloucestershire; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Elizabeth Peters.  She had served since 2002.

We cross the boundary from Herefordshire into Gloucestershire where there are two polls this week, but keep our connection with Frome for the first poll - this time, the River Frome which cuts through the Cotswolds in a narrow, gorge-like valley.  Clinging to the northern side of that valley is the village of Chalford, which expanded rapidly in the eighteenth century with the arrival of Flemish weavers, who brought with them a high-quality textile industry, and the opening of the now-derelict Thames and Severn Canal.  Also within the ward is the village of Bussage, which grew strongly in the 1980s with the development of the Manor Farm Estate.

Through most of this century Chalford ward has had a large Conservative lead with Labour and the Greens splitting the opposition vote fairly evenly.  The 2016 election changed things a bit as the Conservative vote markedly declined; although the party held the ward's three seats, their vote share fell to just 32% to 28% each for the Greens and Labour.  There was more bad news for the Conservatives here in 2017: in May's county elections, they lost the local Minchinhampton division to the Green Party in a straight fight, by the small margin of 2,320 votes to 2,293; and in June's general election they lost the Stroud constituency to Labour, again by a small margin (29,994 to 29,307 on a high turnout of 77%).

Defending this three-way marginal for the Conservatives is Darren Loftus, a 33-year-old property manager from Chalford.  The Greens have selected Robin Lewis, a semi-retired college lecturer.  The Labour candidate is Karen Pitney, a former long-serving BBC employee now working for the Gloucestershire GP Co-operative.  Completing the ballot paper is Kris Beacham for the Liberal Democrats.

Grumbolds Ash with Avening

Cotswold council, Gloucestershire; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Jim Parsons.  Parsons was first elected in 1999 for the former Avening ward as an independent, gaining the Conservative nomination in 2007 and transferring to Grumbolds Ash with Avening ward in 2015.

For our second Gloucestershire by-election of the week we stay in the Cotswolds but travel to the southern boundary of the county.  This is a diffuse ward of eight parishes to the north and west of Tetbury, running from Cherington in the north to Didmarton on the Wiltshire boundary.  None of the parishes are called Grumbolds Ash, a name which commemorates an ancient Hundred of Gloucestershire.  Avening, on the Tetbury-Nailsworth road, is the ward's largest settlement with 888 electors; by comparison the small parish of Ozleworth has just 30 electors on the register.  Here can be found the Forestry Commission's National Arboretum at Westonbirt together with Nan Tow's Tump, a Bronze Age barrow next to the A46 Bath-Nailsworth road.

At the time of the 2011 census most of this area was in the former Grumbolds Ash ward, which made the top 20 in England and Wales for households living rent-free (8.5%) and had high self-employment levels.  The present ward was created in 2015,  Grumbolds Ash ward was strongly Conservative and frequently uncontested, and that has carried through to the present ward where in 2015 the Tories beat the Liberal Democrats 71-29 in a straight fight.

Defending for the Conservatives is Richard Morgan, a Tetbury resident who runs an adventure travel business.  The Liberal Democrat candidate is Nicky Baber, a Kemble and Ewen parish councillor.  Completing the ballot paper is Labour candidate Edward Shelton who is the only candidate to live in the ward (in Didmarton).

St Margaret's-at-Cliffe

Dover council, Kent; caused by the resignation of the Leader of the Council, Conservative councillor Paul Watkins, who is retiring from politics.  A former nurse who later founded a nursing home company, Watkins was first elected in 1983 for Lower Walmer ward; he stood down in 1995 but returned to the council in 1999 from St Margaret's-at-Cliffe ward.  Watkins was chairman of Dover council from 1989 to 1992 and had served as Leader of the Council since 2003.

For our final column, welcome to the front line of Brexit.  In fact, welcome to the front line full stop.  This is the ward which contains the iconic White Cliffs of Dover, traditionally Britain's first line of defence against invasion from the Continent, and the first part of the UK which visitors see as they approach the port of Dover on the ferry from Calais.  Not surprisingly for such a strategic location, the military are still here ready for any invasion: St Margaret's-at-Cliffe ward includes Fort Burgoyne and the Duke of York's Royal Military School, on the hills behind Dover Castle.  A significant number of Gurkhas live in the ward, putting St Margaret's-at-Cliffe in the top 10 wards in England and Wales for Buddhism, while the Duke of York's school means that the ward is in the top 100 in England and Wales for 16- and 17-year-olds.  (That school is one of only three schools in England and Wales to have military colours; the other two are Eton and Cheltenham College.)

The ward itself essentially covers the area between Dover and Deal.  At its centre is the village of St Margaret's at Cliffe itself, which marks the point where the North Sea ends and the English Channel begins.  The village was mostly evacuated during the Second World War as it was within range of German artillery in France.  Further inland is Martin Mill, home to the ward's railway station on the Dover-Deal line.

The White Cliffs have been a source of much controversy in recent years.  A couple of months ago an appeal by the National Trust raised £1 million to prevent the cliffs being sold to developers, while a few years back a well-known UKIP election poster depicted an escalator going to the clifftop.  That didn't stop UKIP taking second place in this ward in the 2015 local elections: they had 25% to 53% for the winning Conservative slate and 22% for Labour.  In May's county elections the Conseratives pulled away from Labour in the previously marginal division of Dover North, which includes this ward.

Defending for the Conservatives is Peter Jull, who fought his home ward of North Deal in 2015.  With UKIP not returning to the polls, in a straight fight Jull is opposed by Charles Woodgate, who fought the local county seat in May and stood in Tunbridge Wells in June's general election; Woodgate is described as having a strong business background with 30 years working in international trade, finance and banking.
