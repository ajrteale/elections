Eight polls on 14th December 2017:

Bradwell; and
Newchapel

Newcastle-under-Lyme council, Staffordshire; caused respectively by the death of Trevor Hambleton at the age of 71 and the resignation of Lionel Burch.  Both were Labour councillors.  Hambleton was first elected in 1999 and was Mayor of Newcastle in 2011-12; his widow Sandra remains a councillor for Bradwell ward.  Burch, who had served since May 2016, resigned abruptly following unspecified allegations against his conduct from within the council's Labour group.

<blockquote>
"For me a vote is not merely a mark on a paper; it symbolises my inalienable right to choose who shall govern me and set the tenor of my life for the next five years.  This right and privilege has been won for us over many generations by brave and dedicated men and women and is a precious gift.  That I have been robbed of it by administrative incompetence is an insult to their legacy and a grave disservice to me."
</blockquote>

My text this week is taken from the Scallan Report, and is a letter written by an elector of Newcastle-under-Lyme.  It is particularly poignant as today marks 99 years since the General Election of 1918, in which women (or at least those over the age of 30) were eligible to vote for the first time.  That was the culmination of many years of pressure from the suffragette movement and others; as almost everybody who reads these words will be aware, people have died for the right to vote.  For the last 99 years, we have all had cause to be grateful for their hard work and pressure.

In the 99 years since then, the number 99 has become indelibly associated with the word "flake".  And so it is here, for we must start this week's previews not by discussing the delights of a particularly interesting and yet little-known area of Staffordshire, but in the Elections Office of Newcastle-under-Lyme town hall.  Your columnist, in his line of work. has long experience of trying to sort out official and administrative errors and thought he had heard it all; but the Newcastle-under-Lyme election of June 2017 is one of the most shocking examples of incompetence he has had cause to discuss and dissect for a long time.

The root cause of what went wrong in Newcastle in June is very simple, and rather worrying for those who care about the effectiveness of our local government: the Electoral Services Officer and her line manager both left the authority in 2016 and were not replaced.  This meant that the county council elections in May 2017 were handled by a consultant who worked three days a week, a full-time temp and a part-timer both with experience of running elections, and two secondees.  That election was generally handled well.  However, there were further personnel changes for the general election because the consultant wasn't able to stay on and the full-time temp left, so a second consultant and a full-time agency worker had to be brought in in the middle of the election campaign.  Crucially, the second consultant - who seems to have been appointed because he had previously worked in the Newcastle elections office -  had little experience of the Individual Electoral Registration system which was introduced in 2015.

Once this is understood, the failings identified in the report compiled by Andrew Scallan - which contains fifty-eight pages of gory detail - can be simply summarised under a heading which anybody who has to deal with incompetence and its causes will be familiar with: "if you don't know what you're doing, you don't know what you're doing wrong".  As a long-serving Director of Electoral Administration for the Electoral Commission, who was appointed CBE for his service, Scallan was certainly well-placed to get to the bottom of it all.  His report identified the following failings by Newcastle-under-Lyme council at the 2017 general election:

- 391 postal votes for UK addresses and 204 postal votes for overseas addresses were not sent out.  68 of those electors successfully complained that their postal votes had not arrived and were issued replacements, leaving 527 people disenfranchised.  This error was not picked up by the elections office until after polling day, resulting in poor customer service to those electors who complained.  In additional, postal polling cards were not sent out, resulting in those electors who had not received postal votes they had applied for not being aware of their rights and deadlines to request a replacement or not being aware that they could not vote in person.

- Polling station staff were not provided with lists of postal voters, which resulted in at least one elector - who had been wrongly shown on the register as being a postal voter - being disenfranchised.  (This error was also made in May's county elections.)

- Some registration and postal vote applications handed in at council offices were lost.

- Due to the staff's inexperience in Individual Electoral Registration and the volume of applications, 439 applications for registration were received before the deadline (22 May) but not processed in time for polling day; while 509 applications for registration were received before the deadline and processed in time for polling day, but were not added to the register for polling day because of a delay in switching the office's computer system to "election mode".  86 people complained about this, and the elections office misused their power to correct clerical errors to do what they should have done in the first place and add them to the register.  An unknown number of other applications to vote needed further information to determine whether they were eligible, but this was not followed up by the elections office in a timely manner - that seems to been a particular problem for Keele University students.  In addition electors who applied after the deadline were sent misleading letters suggesting that they would be eligible to vote in the general election.

- On polling day, the elections office reaped what had been sown as all these problems came to a head.  The staff were simply overwhelmed by the volume of enquiries and it is clear that not all of those enquiries were handled in a professional manner.  Amid the chaos two people who were not eligible to vote in the election were allowed to do so.

The Scallan Report concluded that at least 998 electors in the Newcastle-under-Lyme constituency were disenfranchised as a result of these errors.  It lays the blame for this squarely at the feet of inadequate performance by the Chief Executive as Acting Returning Officer, the Head of Audit who had line responsibility for the consultants, and the consultants themselves; together with the inexperience and under-resourcing of the election office's staff.

In most general elections 998 votes is not going to have an effect on the overall result; but as bad luck would have it the Labour MP for Newcastle-under-Lyme, Paul Farrelly, was eventually declared the winner on 9th June with a majority of just thirty votes.  There can be little doubt that, given the evidence laid out in the Scallan Report, the Election Court would void that result and order a new election.  Unfortunately, petitions questioning the result have to be filed with the Election Court within 21 days of the declaration, a deadline which has long gone.  Through no fault of his own, Farrelly now finds himself with a mandate which is at best questionable and at worst illegitimate; and the only way for him to resolve the question as to whether he was duly elected is for him to resign and fight a by-election.  At the time of writing, he has not resigned; and, given the state of the Newcastle-under-Lyme elections office (which has one remaining employee, who only works part-time) that's not surprising.  Farrelly will want some kind of indication that this or something like it isn't going to happen again, and properly staffing the elections office - one of the 16 recommendations made to the council in the Scallan Report is that Newcastle-under-Lyme appoint a permanent Electoral Services Manager and at least two FTE supporting posts - would be a good start along that road.

Cases of incompetence in public office on this scale usually lead to demands for senior heads to roll, which rather misses the point that many of the problems with the Newcastle-under-Lyme election in June stemmed from senior heads not being there in the first place.  Newcastle council have suspended the Chief Executive John Sellgren and the Head of Audit Elizabeth Dodd.  At the time of writing, they have not resigned; and, given that the Scallan Report recommended that Staffordshire Police investigate them for breach of official duty, an electoral offence which carries an unlimited fine, that's not surprising.  They will want to protect their legal position.

However, this whole fiasco has resulted in the resignation of one person - the Labour Leader of the Council, Elizabeth Shenton.  Newcastle-under-Lyme council is hung, with Labour as the largest group holding 24 seats plus these two vacancies but short of a majority; the Conservatives are on 22 seats and the balance of power is held by three Lib Dems, a Kipper and eight independent councillors of various stripes (several of whom were originally elected on the UKIP ticket).  At last week's full council meeting the independents withdrew their support for the previous Labour administration and voted in the Conservatives, who have formed a minority administration of their own.  If the Conservatives can gain both of today's by-elections they will draw level with Labour and running the council will become that little bit easier.

With the Returning Officer suspended and the Newcastle-under-Lyme elections office clearly in no fit state to administer a poll, the council has effectively outsourced the job of running today's two by-elections, at very short notice, to what Newcastle's Twitter feed coyly calls "our neighbouring authority".  That would be Stoke-on-Trent: local government watchers may have been given endless amusement by Stoke's political dysfunctionality over the years, but the city's elections staff come with a good reputation.  We have to hope that they can sort out their sister borough's problems quickly.

That brings me to the by-elections themselves.  To recap, these are Labour defences in Bradwell and Newchapel wards.  Bradwell ward lies at the northern end of Newcastle town between the A34 and A500 roads.  Once a coalmining area, this is now a riot of business parks benefiting from its proximity to the A500 and the Stoke-Manchester railway line - the JCB warehouse next to the railway at Chatterley Valley is particularly impressive.  Despite all those jobs, qualification rates in the ward are low.

Newchapel ward deserves an article all to itself and it's a shame that hasn't happened this time.  Your columnist covered the ward in a previous edition of Andrew's Previews in 2011, and after writing it up I thought it might be a nice place to visit.  When I did eventually get there I was blown away.  This is a high area on the hills between Kidsgrove and Biddulph, based on the villages of Harriseahead and the Staffordshire half of the strange hilltop village of Mow Cop.  Originally a quarrying village for millstones, Mow Cop is built around a 1,099-foot summit whch is flanked by the rock formation of the Old Man of Mow and the folly of Mow Cop Castle.  The Old Man and the Castle lie on the Staffordshire-Cheshire boundary, and on a good day provide fantastic views over the whole of the Cheshire Plain towards Manchester, the Peak District, the West Pennine Moors, the Shropshire hills, the Berwyn and Flintshire mountains and even Snowdonia.  It's beautiful.  You must go.  The name "Newchapel" is rather appropriate: up here on the hill in 1807 two Wesleyan preachers, Hugh Bourne and William Clowes, held a successful camp meeting which - after they were thrown out of the Wesleyan Church - led to the development of Primitive Methodism.  Today Newchapel's demographic can be best described as affluent working-class, with significant numbers of manufacturing jobs and a very high proportion of residents born in the UK.

That's led to some interesting election results in Newchapel over the years.  In 2002 - the first election on the current boundaries - the Liberal Democrats won both seats, but they lost one to the Conservatives in 2003 and the other to Labour the following year.  The Conservatives picked up the Labour seat in 2008.  Labour gained both of the ward's seats in 2011 (one in the ordinary May election and the other in a November by-election), but the Conservatives got one seat back in 2015 and were very close to gaining the other last year.  In a straight fight in 2016, Labour held their seat by 385 votes to 379 - a majority of six.  The Conservatives narrowly gained the local county division (Kidsgrove) in May and will definitely see this as within range for a Tory gain - something we haven't seen much of recently.

Bradwell ward is a much safer Labour area which since 2002 has only voted Conservative once, at the Labour low point of 2008.  Incidentally the losing Labour candidate that year was Gareth Snell, who is now the MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central.  In 2016 Labour won here with 54%, to 24% for UKIP and 19% for the Conservatives.  Again the Tories very narrowly gained the local county division of Bradwell, Porthill and Wolstanton in May; but as Porthill consistently votes Conservative and Wolstanton is politically volatile it is likely that Labour had a lead in Bradwell ward.

These will be the last by-elections to Newcastle-under-Lyme's current ward boundaries, as the council will be all-up in May on a new ward pattern - so whoever wins these by-elections will have to be back on the campaign trail in short order to seek re-election.  Also after May the council will move away from election by thirds, so the next elections after May will be in 2022.  Both Bradwell and Newchapel wards will see only minor changes in May, with Newchapel being renamed as "Newchapel and Mow Cop".

Defending Bradwell for Labour is Andrew Fox-Hewitt, a firefighter and secretary of the Cheshire branch of the Fire Brigades Union.  There is no UKIP candidate - something which says volumes about the decline of the party, who have always been well-organised in Newcastle.  The Conservative candidate is Gail Benbow.  Richard Virr, of the Liberal Democrats, completes the ballot paper.

In Newchapel the defending Labour candidate is Angela Cooper.  Jill Waring returns for the Conservatives after her near-miss last year.  Completing the ballot paper is Nigel Morgan, an independent candidate endorsed by the council's Kidsgrove Independents group.

Let's hope for a smooth and orderly poll this time.  It's not too much to ask; and it would be a fitting tribute to democracy on the 99th anniversary of women's suffrage in the UK.
