ARBURY, Nuneaton and Bedworth borough council, Warwickshire; caused by the disqualification of Labour councillor Kevin Young for failing to attend any meetings of the council in six months.

This ward is named after the Tudor and Gothic Revival country house of Arbury Hall and its associated estate, which has been in the hands of the Newdigate family and its successsors (currently the 4th Viscount Daventry) since the sixteenth century.  As well as being a Grade I listed building, Arbury Hall was immortalised in literature under the nom-de-plume of "Cheverel Manor" in the short story "Mr Gilfil's Love Story" by local lass George Eliot; Mary Anne Evans was the daughter of the Arbury Estate manager.  Eliot has left her name on Nuneaton in many ways, including the troubled George Eliot Hospital, the main A&E hospital for Nuneaton around which most of the ward's population is clustered.

This ward is a key marginal in the struggle for the Nuneaton parliamentary seat (the wider borough, which includes Bedworth, is better for Labour).  In 2002 it was Labour fairly comfortably.  The Tories reduced the Labour majority to 31 votes at the 2004 election, and gained the ward's two seats from Labour in 2006 and 2008.  Labour got one of the seats back in 2010 with a majority of 29 votes, and the other in 2012 very safely.  In May Labour also gained from the Conservatives the wider Arbury and Stockingford county division, former Nuneaton Labour MP Bill Olner topping the poll.

Defending for Labour is Tricia Elliott, a teacher at the town's King Edward VI sixth-form college, which in times past educated Nuneaton's present Conservative MP Marcus Jones.  The Tories have selected photographer Jeff Morgan.  The only other party to stand here in 2012 was the Greens, who have reselected Mike Wright.  Also standing in this by-election are Bedworth-based Trevor Beard for UKIP, the BNP's Alwyn Deacon (who fought this county division in May), TUSC's Aidan O'Toole and the English Democrats' Stephen Paxton.

RIVERSIDE and SPLOTT, Cardiff; caused by the resignations of Labour councillors Phil Hawkins and Luke Holland respectively.

Two by-elections in the capital city of Wales.  The Riverside division lies across the River Taff from the Millennium Stadium and Cathays Park.  Much of the actual riverside forms the park of Sophia Gardens, home to Glamorgan cricket club's Test ground, the SWALEC Stadium.  This is an interesting mix of areas; Riverside proper at the south end is an ethnic enclave with large Bangladeshi and Chinese populations, while Pontcanna to the north is a leafy area favoured by the Welsh arts and media establishment (the so-called "crachach") and was once a broadcasting centre for HTV and S4C.

There are also broadcasting links with Splott, the place of birth of the Today and Mastermind presenter John Humphreys and the BBC Radio 2 traffic reporter Lynn Bowles.  South-east of the city centre, Splott was a steelworking centre created by the industrial revolution, and even today almost the entire housing stock is late-Victorian terracing.  The Splott division also includes the severely deprived Tremorfa area, further out of town.

These two divisions have very difficult political complexions.  Splott is a Labour versus Lib Dem battle, the Lib Dems' share of the three seats having fallen from two in 2004 and one in 2008 to nought as a result of the 2012 election, although their vote did not collapse utterly and they are still the clear challengers to Labour in the division.  Riverside, on the other hand, is a Labour versus Plaid battle: the three seats there split 2-1 in Plaid's favour in 2004.  Plaid gained the Labour seat in 2008 but then the tide turned, Labour easily winning a March 2011 by-election and gaining the other two seats in 2012.

Riverside's defending Labour candidate is PCS officer Darren Williams, who got into trouble earlier this year for suggesting on Facebook that Tony Blair should share Margaret Thatcher's coffin.  His main opposition will come from Plaid's Elizabeth Gould.  Aled Crow stands for the Conservatives, Sian Donne for the Lib Dems, Joel Beer for the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition and Simon Zeigler for UKIP, fighting the ward for the first time.

In Splott a major election issue appears to be the proposed closure of the local swimming pool.  The defending Labour candidate is Edward Stubbs, whose main opposition will come from the Lib Dems' Jamie Matthews, a disability charity worker.  The Tories have selected Daniel Mason and Katrine Williams stands for TUSC.  Independent Elys John and UKIP's Brian Morris complete the ballot paper.

ANCOATS AND CLAYTON, Manchester city council; caused by the death of Labour councillor Mike Carmody.

[Kris: I would suggest reusing that photograph of the Daily Express Building]

We've been here before, and very recently; this is the second by-election in Ancoats in just eight weeks, Mike Carmody having died just before the polling date for the first by-election on 10th October.

There is a very detailed description of Ancoats and Clayton ward in the 10th October previews, so this time I shall restrict myself to noting that this ward combines the famous Industrial Revolution suburb of Ancoats, now being extensively regenerated, with the more standard-issue Manchester suburb of Clayton on the Ashton New Road.  There has been time since the last by-election for one material change to the description in the last preview: the Droyslden Metrolink branch, which links the various parts of the ward together, is now the Ashton-under-Lyne Metrolink branch following the opening of a further extension.

Recently the ward has been seeing big, significant wins for the blue team, but those are restricted to the pitch at the Etihad Stadium in the centre of the ward.  In terms of votes in ballot boxes, Ancoats and Clayton is as red as they come, a status confirmed by the October by-election in which Labour polled 71%, which was actually four points lower than in the 2012 ordinary election.  Best of the rest in October were UKIP on 9%, the Lib Dems (who were competitive here in the early Noughties) finishing seventh in a field of seven candidates.

Defending for Labour this time is Ollie Manco, a careers advisor and secretary of the Manchester Central constituency Labour party.  UKIP have selected Blackley-based Martin Power, while the Greens' Pete Birkinshaw is one of three candidates from the October by-election to stand again, along with the Pirate Party UK leader Loz Kaye (in his home ward) and the BNP's Gareth Black.  The Tory candidate this time is David Semple, a film-maker from Old Trafford, while the Lib Dems are represented by Clayton-based Claude Nsumbu, who stood here in 2010.  Finally, three new parties have thrown their respective hats into the ring: the Communist League (represented by Carole Bellamy from Fallowfield), the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition (Alex Davidson from Old Trafford) and the unreconstructed Liberal Party (Ken Dobson from Ancoats).

RIVERSIDE, Liverpool city council; caused by the resignation of the Deputy Mayor of Liverpool, Labour councillor Paul Brant.

Here we have another ward which has been previewed before in this column, although you have to go back a little bit further to the previous by-election, which was in July 2012.

The Riverside ward of Liverpool covers some of the famous areas of the city.  Running south from the edge of the city centre, here can be found the Albert Dock, Chinatown, the Anglican cathedral, Dingle and so on, with Liverpool Central station connecting the ward to the rest of Merseyside.  However, most of the ward's population live in the notorious byword for urban deprivation that is Toxteth.  Any ward that includes Toxteth is going to be safe Labour, and the Labour vote has grown from 57% in 2004 to 81% in the 2012 ordinary election, in which the Lib Dems - by then in severe disarray in Liverpool - failed to stand a candidate.  That 2012 ordinary election also saw the election of ward councillor Joe Anderson as Mayor of Liverpool in the first round; the resulting by-election in July 2012 saw the Labour share fall slightly to 77%, the Greens being best of the rest on 9% of the vote.

The defending Labour candidate is Michelle Corrigan, a 29-year-old health and social charity worker and volunteer.  Up against her are the Green candidate and local PPC Martin Dobson, who is campaigining against plans by the council to sell part of Sefton Park Meadows; Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition candidate John Marston; Kevin White for the Liberal Democrats; Chris Hall for the Conservatives; Adam Heatherington for UKIP; Steven McEllenborough for the English Democrats; and independents Peter Cooney and Alison Goudie.

SHETTLESTON, Glasgow city council; caused by the death of Labour councillor George Ryan, a Glasgow city councillor since reorganisation in 1995, at the age of 51.

This eastern Glasgow suburb, about two-and-a-half miles east of the city centre on the Shettleston Road and London Road, was reported by the Observer in 2004 to be the only place in the UK where life expectancy is falling: the life expectancy here is 63, mainly due to poor diets, high levels of alcohol and tobacco use, and general deprivation.  The ward also includes the slightly detached village of Carmyle, in a bend of the River Clyde south of the M74 motorway.

Shettleston has been relatively unaffected by the SNP rise in Glasgow, and in the 2012 election the Labour share of the vote rose from 52% to 61%, mostly at the expense of minor parties.  Since the introduction of PR in 2007 the SNP have held one of the four seats here with Labour in possession of the other three.

The minor parties could be back with a vengeance with twelve candidates on the ballot paper, several of whom also stood in the Govan by-election two months ago.  Labour's Martin Neill has to be the favourite to win the by-election and should do so in the first round.  His main opposition will come from the SNP's Laura Doherty, a 22-year-old art gallery assistant, and, if the evidence of the Govan by-election is anything to go by, the anti-bedroom tax campaigner John Flanagan.  Also standing are Raymond McCrae (Conservative), Alasdair Duke (Scottish Green Party), Tommy Ball (Scottish Socialist Party), James Spiers (Lib Dem), Charles Baillie (Britannica), Jamie Cocozza (Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition), Victor Murphy (Christian Party), Arthur Thackeray (UKIP) and James Trolland (Scottish Democratic Alliance), who must surely do better this time than the one vote he polled in Govan.

SOUTH WOODHAM - ELMWOOD AND WOODVILLE, Chelmsford city council, Essex; caused by the disqualification of Conservative councillor Maureen Moulds, who has been in poor health, for failing to attend any meetings of the council in six months.

There's a ward name to get your tongue around.  Try saying that ten times - you're guaranteed to mess it up.

This is the northern of the two wards covering the relatively new town of South Woodham Ferrers, much of which has been developed since the mid-1970s.  In the Essex marshes on the north bank of the Crouch estuary, South Woodham Ferrers is linked to the outside world by a single A-road to the South Essex towns together with the single-track Crouch Valley railway line; change at Wickford for Liverpool Street.  The ward is dominated by Bushy Hill to the north of the town with its radar testing station.  One pecularity of the town is that the freehold for the vast majority of the land is owned by the supermarket company Asda.

A traditionally Tory ward, the Conservatives have come under pressure in recent years from the localist South Woodham Ferrers Independents, led by former Lib Dem candidate Ian Roberts who has stood here in every district election this century.  Roberts was 136 votes behind the Conservatives across the town in May's county election, and in the 2011 district election the Tory majorities in this ward ranged from 256 to 196.

The defending Conservative candidate is Linda Denston, wife of one of the two remianing Tory councillors for the ward.  Ian Roberts tries again for the South Woodham Ferrers Independents.  Derek Barnett is the Labour candidate, as he was in May's county election.  Also standing are Chelmsford-based Jeni Goldfinch for the Lib Dems, and UKIP candidate Ian Nicholls who gives an address in Writtle, on the other side of Chelmsford.

SWANSCOMBE, Dartford borough council, Kent; caused by the death of councillor Leslie Bobby of the Swanscombe and Greenhithe Residents Association.

More marshland next to an estuary, this time on the south bank of the Thames estuary.  Swanscombe has a long history going back to prehistory, thanks the discovery of parts of the skull of the 400,000-year-old Swanscombe Man - now thought to a female Homo heidelbergensis.  The modern town of Swanscombe grew thanks to chalk quarrying and the cement industry; one of the large quarries, separating Swanscombe from the town of Northfleet to the east, is now the site of Ebbsfleet International railway station on High Speed 1, with regular trains to London, Paris and Brussels.

Swanscombe local politics is the fiefdom of the Swanscombe and Greenhithe Residents Association, who at the most recent district election in 2011 were opposed only by Labour and UKIP.  The Residents have also held the Swanscombe and Greenhithe county council seat since 2009, narrowly holding off the Conservatives, Labour and UKIP in May to win with less than 27% of the vote.

Defending for the Residents Association is Vic Openshaw, who lost his district council seat in Greenhithe ward to the Conservatives in 2011.  Labour have selected Steve Doran, who despite the name is a woman and a former mayoress of Dartford.  Regular UKIP candidate Stephen Wilders tries again.  The Conservatives are contesting the ward for the first time since 2003 with Steven Jarnell, and the former Residents county councillor Richard Lees, who stood down in May, is standing as an independent.
