By-elections 18 July 2013

CONNAH'S QUAY GOLFTYN, Flintshire county council; caused by the death of Labour councillor Peter Macfarlane from liver cancer.  A former firefighter who served in the RAF, Cllr Macfarlane had first been elected to the now-abolished Alyn and Deeside district council and had served on Connah's Quay town council for 26 years.  He was Flintshire's cabinet member for regeneration, enterprise and leisure.

Perhaps surprisingly for those who may have never heard of it, Connah's Quay is Flintshire's largest town with a population of around 17,500.  The town is on the south bank of the River Dee, but its boundaries extend all the way to the English border in what was once the centre of the Dee estuary before the river was channeled and much of what had been the estuary silted up.  

The gradual silting of the Dee has created an awful lot of reclaimed land.  On the English side of the boundary, the land just outside the Chester city walls where the Romans once moored their ships is now Chester Racecourse.  Further up on the Wirral is Parkgate, which is a long way from the shoreline now but still has a seafront which used to look out on the main channel of the Dee.  The quay at Connah's Quay itself had fallen victim to silt by the 1960s, but don't despair: the north bank of the Dee within the town boundary is all flat, reclaimed land and has been put to good industrial use: there is still a large steelworks on the north bank together with a very large industrial estate (Deeside Industrial Park) and a pair of gas-fired power stations, one on each bank.  Connah's Quay Power Station can be found on the south bank of the Dee at the western end of the town, which is also the part covered by Connah's Quay Golftyn division.  Linking the two banks within the division is the Flintshire Bridge, an impressive cable-stayed structure which is a bit of a "road to nowhere", linking as it does an industrial area with Flint and Connah's Quay, and lacking a good link on the south side of the Dee to the main A55 road.

All this heavy industry makes Connah's Quay predisposed to vote Labour.  The Golftyn division returned two Labour councillors unopposed in 2004.  At the 2008 election Labour were opposed only by independent candidate Eric Owen, who topped the poll but served only one term before Labour regained his seat at the 2012 election.

This by-election will be another faceoff between Labour and Owen.  Labour's defending candidate is Connah's Quay town councillor Andy Dundobbin.  Eric Owen, one of two independent town councillors, wants his county council seat back, and has been accused of scaremongering by Labour after raising concerns that street lights in the area could be turned off to save money.  Also nominated is the first Conservative candidate here for at least a decade, David Chamberlain-Jones from Buckley.

SAWSTON, South Cambridgeshire district council; caused by the resignation of Independent councillor Sally Hatton.

With 7,145 inhabitants according to the 2011 census, Sawston is the largest settlement in South Cambridgeshire district but still only has the status of a village.  In fact, South Cambridgeshire doesn't have any towns at all, the town functions in the area being fulfilled by Cambridge which forms a borough of its own.  This hasn't stopped the area having some spectacular population growth since the Second World War, but that growth has been absorbed not by building a new town but by adding bits and bobs and housing estates to the villages that already existed.  As well as Cambridge and London commuting, Sawston does have a little industry of its own, notably a large paper mill north-west of the village, next to the Liverpool Street-Cambridge railway line and the River Cam.

This industry (tanning was also important here) created a base Labour vote that was able to win Sawston ward on occasion during their zenith years.  The Conservatives gained Sawston from Labour in 2000 to hold all three seats in the ward.  Sally Hatton was first elected in 2003 in a close three-way fight with the Tories and Labour.  South Cambridgeshire was re-warded in 2004; while Sawston ward was unchanged, all its three seats were up for election that year and they split three ways, with Sally Hatton topping the poll, the Tories coming in second and Labour winning a close fight for the final seat.  The Labour seat was promptly lost back to the Conservatives in 2006, but in the two attempts since then the Tories failed to dislodge Hatton, who was re-elected by 38 votes at the 2008 election (at which she was not opposed by Labour) and by 30 votes in 2012.  Hatton's resignation means that the Conservatives now have the chance to hold all three seats here for the first time in ten years.  Sawston forms part of a two-seat county division with Great and Little Shelford to the north, which was comfortably held by the Conservatives in May's Cambridgeshire county elections.

There is no Independent candidate to step into Hatton's shoes so her seat is up for grabs.  The defending Conservative candidate is parish councillor Kevin Cuffley, who runs the Village Cobbler shop.  Labour and the Liberal Democrats have both picked candidates who ran in Sawston in the county elections in May: respectively Mike Nettleton (from Great Shelford) and Michael Kilpatrick (from Whittlesford).  The ballot paper is completed by UKIP candidate Elizabeth Smith, from Duxford.
