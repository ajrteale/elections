BANBURY RUSCOTE, Cherwell district council, Oxfordshire; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Pat Cartledge.

The main town of northern Oxfordshire, Banbury is an old town with a surprising amount of industry considering its size.  Its mediaeval economy was based on wool, the town being well-sited at the junction of two ancient roads.  The opening of the Oxford Canal in the late eighteenth century confirmed its prosperity, and Banbury's nineteenth and early-twentieth century economy was based on the railways and an enormous cattle market.  After the Second World War population growth and London/Birmingham overspill led to the development of the Hardwick and Ruscote estates on the west side of town, and two major factories were built; the Alcan aluminium factory closed down in the mid-Noughties, but Kraft Foods is still going strong and is the main Kraft manufacturing centre in Britain.

This profile creates a normally-Labour ward which turned into a key marginal during the later Blair and Brown years, although it took until 2007 and 2008 for the Conservatives to break through and they never held all of the ward's three seats.  The Tory vote has declined since they came into power nationally; they lost their last seat in May 2012 and the ward is now safe for Labour, a status confirmed by a previous by-election held in November 2012 on Police and Crime Commissioner election day.  Labour also hold the Banbury Ruscote county division (which includes part of the neighbouring Banbury Neithrop ward).

Defending for Labour is Mark Cherry, county councillor for the Banbury Calthorpe county division in the south of the town.  Conservative Pat Tompson wants her district council seat back after losing to Labour in 2012, but she was also the candidate in the by-election last November so the omens for doing that do not seem good.  Christiam Miller, for UKIP, completes the ballot paper.

COLEFORD EAST and REDMARLEY, Forest of Dean district council, Gloucestershire; caused by the deaths respectively of Labour councillor Frank Baynham and Conservative councillor Peter Ede.

One of the small industrial towns in which the Forest of Dean specialises, Coleford started off life as a centre for coal-mining (as the name might suggest) and ironworking; today Coleford's economy is based on tourism, administration (the Forest of Dean council offices are here) and a large factory which produces the UK's entire supply of Ribena and Lucozade.  One of the tourist centres is the Coleford Great Western Railway museum, located within the Coleford East ward which contains very little of Coleford itself but is instead based on the villages of Milkwall, Coalway and Broadwell to the east of Coleford, all of which lie within the Coleford parish boundary.

At the opposite end of the district on the Worcestershire border is Redmarley ward, named after the village of Redmarley d'Abitot at the southern end of the Malvern Hills  and also including the neighbouring parishes of Pauntley and Staunton.  The strange suffix "d'Abitot" honours Urse d'Abitot, the Domesday-era Sheriff of Worcestershire; much of the area was once within Worcestershire.  This is deeply Tory countryside: the 2011 election (in which the Tories beat Labour by 4 to 1) was the ward's first contested election this century, and the Tories easily held in the local county division (Newent) at a time when the Forest of Dean was one of UKIP's strongest areas.

Coleford East is a more confusing area politically; the 2003 election for the ward returning one Labour councillor, an Independent and a Conservative.  The Tories took the Labour and Independent seat in 2007, but Labour came back in 2011 to gain two of the three seats with a new Independent councillor coming in third.  In between was a very confusing November 2009 by-election which saw the Tories lose a seat to an Independent candidate in a close four-way result, with the Lib Dems coming through strongly to take a close second place, the Tories third and Labour fourth.  The wider Coleford county division was regained by Labour from the Conservatives in May.

The defending Labour candidate for Coleford East is Ruardean-based Tanya Palmer, who was apparently shortlisted for the Forest's Labour parliamentary selection; she describes herself on Twitter as a socialist, feminist trade unionist.  The new Independent candidate is Keith Aburrow, a former Conservative district councillor for Pillowell ward who tried to defend his seat in 2011 as an Independent and finished last.  This is Aburrow's home ward.  The official Conservative candidate is Harry Ives, from Lydney, who appears to have recently graduated in Chemistry from UCL.  The Lib Dems are standing former Coleford town councillor Heather Lusty, and UKIP's candidate is Alan Grant, from Lydney.

The Redmarley race should be more straightforward unless UKIP can get their act together more convincingly than they did in May.  In pole position is the Tory candidate, Redmarley parish councillor Clayton Williams, a former motorcycle and speedway racer who has turned his passion into a company which overhauls motorcycle engines for race performance.  Lining up on the grid with him are Labour candidate Andy Hewlett and UKIP's Alec Tritton, a marketing consultant.

CROCKENHILL AND WELL HILL, Sevenoaks district council, Kent; caused by the death of Labour councillor Jenny Dibsdall.

This ward covers one of the few areas of genuine countryside within the M25 London orbital motorway; in this case, west of junctions 3 and 4.  The ward's largest village, Crockenhill, is a dormitory village located just south of Swanley with some market gardening.  The Irish footballer Tony Cascarino started his career as a boy with Crockenhill football club, who sold him to his first League club Gillingham in 1981, allegedly in exchange for new tracksuits.  

The previous election results for Crockenhill and Well Hill don't give much of a pointer to this by-election.  The councillor for many years had been Colin Dibsdall, who won very large majorities as a Liberal Democrat candidate in 2003 and 2007; in 2011 he sought re-election as an Independent and was unopposed.  Colin Dibsdall died in early 2012 and the resulting by-election was won easily by his widow Jenny, who had the Labour nomination.  The ward is part of a safely Conservative county council division (Darent Valley).

Jenny's death means that this is the first ward election without a Dibsdall on the ballot for a very long time.  The defending Labour candidate is Rachel Waterton, a bookkeeper and Crockenhill parish councillor.  The Conservatives have selected Allrik Birch, a former treasurer of the youth wing of UKIP who has fallen out with the party.  UKIP's candidate is Sevenoaks resident Steve Lindsay, and the Lib Dems have re-selected their county council candidate from May Philip Hobson.

HIGHFIELD, Blackpool council, Lancashire; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Chris Maughan, the council's cabinet member for young people, who has a new job in the East Midlands.

Named after the Highfield Road, this is an entirely built-up area of terraces located opposite the Blackpool Airport terminal buildings.  The ward has a relatively old age profile (23% of the population are over the age of 65, compared with 16% for England as a whole) and that has produced a ward which is more Tory-inclined than Blackpool as a whole.  The Conservatives won both of the ward's seats relatively comfortably in 2003 and very comfortably in 2007, but the 2011 election produced a photo-finish in the ward and split representation between the Conservatives and Labour.  This makes this by-election a key marginal.

Defending for the Conservatives is Sue Ridyard, who lost her council seat in Layton at the 2011 election.  Labour's candidate is Peter Hunter, the president of Blackpool Trades Council.  There are two independent candidates: Rob Mottershead, who polled 17% in the ward last time around, tries again, while Chris Maher runs a hotel on the South Shore.  Bill Greene, a former Fylde district councillor, is the Liberal Democrat candidate, Stephen Flanigan has been selected by UKIP, and Green Party candidate Shereen Reedman uses the ballot paper to highlight her opposition to fracking.

MICKLEHAM, WESTHUMBLE AND PIXHAM, Mole Valley district council, Surrey; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Rebecca McCheyne who is relocating to Hampshire.

This ward essentially covers the space between Dorking and Leatherhead, in some beautiful countryside where the River Mole punches north through the North Downs.  Viewers of last year's London Olympics may remember the cycle race repeatedly climbing Box Hill, part of which is in this ward.  At the bottom of Box Hill are the Mole Valley villages of Mickleham, whose A24 bypass was one of the UK's first dual carriageway roads and a notorious accident blackspot [http://www.cbrd.co.uk/photo/mickleham-bends/].  Further up the valley is the village of Westhumble, the ward's largest centre of population with a rail link to London (from Box Hill and Westhumble station), while Pixham is effectively a suburb of Dorking around the town's main railway station.

The ward elects one member to Mole Valley district council, and it saw a gain at the 2011 election, Rebecca McCheyne gaining the ward from the Conservatives after their previous councillor retired.  The Lib Dems also hold the local county division (Dorking Hills), increasing their majority over the Conservatives in May.

Defending for the Liberal Democrats is Roger Hurst, from Pixham, a part-time environmental technician and former head of retail operations for a major high-street chain.  Westhumble-based Duncan Irvine, who works part-time in the City and runs a small gardening enterprise, will hope to regain the seat for the Conservatives.  Also standing is UKIP candidate Adrian Daniels, from Leatherhead.

STORRINGTON, West Sussex county council; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Frank Wilkinson at the age of 76.

If Mickleham is in the shadow of the North Downs, Storrington is in the shadow of the South Downs, lying on the northern slopes of the 700' Kithurst Hill.  The county division named after Storrington also includes the parishes of Parham and Amberley (home to the division's railway station) to the west, and Washington, Wiston and Ashington to the east.  Much of the division is within the South Downs National Park.

Safe Conservative in 2009, Wilkinson was run close by UKIP in May.  The ward's two constituent Horsham district wards (Chantry ward and part of Chanctonbury ward) haven't been to the polls since 2011, when they were both very safely Conservative.

The defending Conservative candidate for this by-election is Philip Circus, chairman of Horsham district council and one of the district councillors for Chanctonbury ward.  He gives an address in West Chiltington, just outside the division.  UKIP have selected John Wallace, a parish councillor in nearby Pulborough.  The Liberal Democrat standard-bearer is Nick Hopkinson from Steyning, a town a few miles to the east, while the Greens have selected James Doyle, a major contributor to the Vote UK forum and former Liberal Democrat county councillor in Worthing.

ST JAMES, Tendring district council, Essex; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Gill Downing at the age of 87.

This is the west end of the Clacton seafront, including the site of the old Butlins camp which has now been redeveloped into housing.

The ward has been safe Conservative since 2007 after the Tories saw off the Lib Dems who had split the ward's two seats in 2003.  At the 2011 election the runner-up spot was disputed by the localist Tendring First and Labour.  The ward is part of the Clacton West county division in which the Tories were run relatively close by UKIP in May.

Defending for the Tories is Andy Wood, county councillor for Clacton North division.  Mark Stephenson, who runs a business promotion business, is the Tendring First candidate, David Bolton stands for Labour, Amanda Peters for the Lib Dems and Susan Shearing, a former Lib Dem district councillor for Peter Bruff ward, is the UKIP candidate.

WAY, Mid Devon district council; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Sarah Fox.

Up in the hills of central Devon a few miles south-west of Tiverton, this ward consists of a series of small villages around Way Village.  Despite the ward name, the main centre of population is Cheriton Fitzpaine (690 electors), with most of the other villages collected into the parishes of Poughill and Cruwys Morchard.  It says something about the isolation of this area that one of the three polling stations for this by-election is a pub: the Cruwys Arms in Pennymoor, catering for Cruwys Morchard parish's 400 electors.

Sarah Fox had been district councillor for the ward since 2007 after defeating the previous independent councillor, who had faced only Green opposition in 2003.  In 2011 Sarah Norman (as she then was) defeated the Labour candidate by 74-26.  The local county division (Willand and Uffculme) is safely Conservative with UKIP second.

Four candidates are standing in this district by-election.  Cathryn Heal, from Lapford, is the defending Conservative candidate and will face opposition from the Lib Dems' Judi Binks (from Kennerleigh), UKIP's Bob Edwards (from Crediton) and independent candidate John Jordan (from Tiverton).

WOMBWELL, Barnsley metropolitan borough council, South Yorkshire; caused by the death of Labour councillor Denise Wilde at the age of 69.

Our final by-election this week is in the South Yorkshire coalfield in the now-ex-colliery town of Wombwell.  As with much of Barnsley, this is a Labour stronghold and the main excitement in elections relates to who comes as runner-up, with the Barnsley Independent Group, the Tories and the BNP all having come second to Labour at some point over the last seven years.

Defending for Labour is Robert Frost, an ex-miner who became a maths teacher after the mines closed.  For the first time since 2004 there is no Barnsley Independent Group councillor on the ballot paper.  Kevin Riddiough stands for the English Democrats, Clive Watkinson for the Conservatives and retired ex-miner Neil Robinson for UKIP.
