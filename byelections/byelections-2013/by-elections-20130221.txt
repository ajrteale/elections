The four by-elections in the third week of February 2013 have some rather interesting features.  Thursday sees three by-elections: the Conservatives defend a district council seat in Norfolk and Labour one in Harrow, both vacated in controversial circumstances, and Labour also have a safe seat to defend in West Yorkshire after their councillor stepped up to become the local Police and Crime Commissioner.  However, this week's column starts with an unusual Tuesday by-election in Essex.

BROOMFIELD AND THE WALTHAMS, Chelmsford city council, Essex; caused by the death of Independent councillor Delmas Ashford at the age of 82.  The last remaining councillor from the first election to the modern Chelmsford council in 1973, Ashford had stood for the Conservatives in the 1999, 2003 and 2007 elections but was otherwise returned as an Independent.

Broomfield and the Walthams is a large rural ward north of Chelmsford, consisting of the Chelmsford suburb of Broomfield and various settlements along the A130 road to Great Dunmow which form the parishes of Great Waltham and Little Waltham.  Broomfield is the site of a major hospital which specialises in plastics and burns treatment and contains about 60% of the ward's electorate, while the villages are more traditional Essex villages; possibly the most interesting feature of them is the Elizabethan Great Waltham Guildhall, recently restored.

In 2003 and 2007 this was a safe Conservative ward, forming part of a safe Conservative county division (Broomfield and Writtle) and a safe Conservative parliamentary seat (Saffron Walden); but shortly afterwards it started to go wrong for the local Conservatives, as they lost a September 2007 by-election here to the Liberal Democrats on a massive swing.  The 2011 result looks much less safe for the Conservatives, with Ashford being the third of the three candidates elected and beating the third Conservative candidate by 142 votes, and the top Lib Dem less than 150 votes behind the third Conservative.  The Lib Dems failed to hold on to their by-election gain but increased their share of the vote compared to the May 2007 election.

Nonetheless, with no independent candidate having come forward to replace Ashford the Conservatives should be favoured to hold this by-election.  Their candidate is William Wetton, about whom I have no information other than that he gives an address in Broomfield.  The Lib Dems are standing Graham Pooley, who lost his council seat in Chelmsford's Marconi ward in 2011, and was councillor for this ward from 1995 to 2003; he is campaigning against major housing plans for the ward.  The Green Party, who beat Labour here last time round, have nominated local doctor Reza Hossain who fought this ward in 2007 and the local county division in 2009.  Labour are going for the youth vote with Sinead Jein, who turned 18 last December, and UKIP are fighting the ward for the first time; their candidate is Ian Nicholls from Writtle, a quantity surveyor.

By-elections on Thursday 21st February 2013:

CASTLEFORD CENTRAL AND GLASSHOUGHTON, Wakefield metropolian borough council, West Yorkshire; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Mark Burns-Williamson who is now the Police and Crime Commissioner for West Yorkshire.

Lagentium to the Romans, Castleford is a town with an old history thanks to its location where a Roman road crossed the River Aire.  The town as it is today grew up in the Victorian era with the opening of several collieries in the area.  These closed down in the late twentieth century, but a lot of regeneration money has been thrown at Castleford since then; much of that has manifested into a major industrial and leisure area south of the town on the site of the old Glasshoughton Colliery adjacent to the M62 motorway, which can now boast a shopping village, a large number of retail and food outlets and the Xscape indoor ski slope, which dominates the surrounding area.  Glasshoughton is served by one of the newest stations on the railway network, opened in 2005 with hourly trains to Leeds and Pontefract; Castleford station itself has half-hourly trains to Leeds and an hourly service to Wakefield.

With its mining history this is a very safe Labour ward and the party has not been seriously challenged since the ward was created in 2004.  The BNP were runners-up here from 2004 until 2010 when they were narrowly beaten by the Tories.  Since 2011 it has been UKIP's turn to run a distant second here.

Labour's candidate for the by-election is Richard Forster, who will face opposition from UKIP's Nathan Garbutt, a former Tory figure who stood in the neighbouring Castleford North ward in May; the Tories' Annemarie Glover, a former Wakefield councillor who lost her seat last year in Wrenthorpe and Outwood West ward; and local CAMRA chairman and Vote UK figure Mark Goodair who is the ward's first Liberal Democrat candidate since 2005.

CROMER TOWN, North Norfolk district council; caused by the death of the Conservative leader of the council Keith Johnson.  It is suspected that he shot his wife dead then turned the gun on himself.  Johnson, a former mayor of Cromer, had been leader of North Norfolk district council since May 2012.

The self-styled Gem of the Norfolk Coast and headquarters of North Norfolk district council, Cromer is a small port and seaside result on the northern coast of the county.  As well as the normal seaside attractions, the Cromer Crab is still fished here and the town does a thriving trade in seafood.  Despite the name, Cromer Town only covers the western half of the resort, with the other half of town covered by Suffield Park ward, named after the various Lords Suffield, major landowners in this part of Norfolk.  This ward includes Cromer's railway station, at the end of a branch line from Norwich.  Like many East Anglian seaside resorts, this ward has a large proportion of retirees and a median age of 52 according to the 2011 census.

North Norfolk district council turned Lib Dem in a big way during the later years of the last Labour government, but at the 2011 election the Conservatives gained overall control for the first time.  The swings in this ward have been rather more muted as it has always returned two Conservative councillors since 2003, but the Tory majority did increase in 2011 and Labour are disputing second place here with the Lib Dems.

The Tories have selected a strong local candidate in Cromer town councillor and former Mayor Tony Nash.  The Lib Dems have reselected their 2011 runner-up Andreas Yiasimi, a photographer.  Labour's candidate is Jen Emery, who currently runs the book publishing company Salt Publishing after twenty years working in the NHS.  The ballot paper is completed by UKIP's David Ramsbotham, who gives an address some miles away in the village of Plumstead; he was a strong second to the Conservatives in Corpusty ward in 2011.  Not on the ballot paper is would-be independent candidate John Morgan, who submitted two sets of nomination papers which were both found to be invalid.

WEST HARROW, Harrow London borough council, North London; caused by the resignation of ex-Labour councillor Brian Gate, who has received a police caution for possessing indecent images of children.

Described in its Wikipedia entry as "bohemian", West Harrow is another of those endless suburban tracts in the area known as Metro-land, in this case spreading out from the West Harrow Underground station on the Uxbridge branch of the Metropolitan Line.  By the mid-twentieth century the ward was essentially full of housing, and in more recent years it has been a major centre for immigration from India; the 2011 census found almost 40% of the population from Asian or Asian British ethnic groups (overwhelmingly Indian) and Hinduism is the second largest religion in the ward after Christianity.

In the three elections from 2002 this ward has been a closely-fought Labour/Conservative marginal.  The seat elected two Labour and one Conservative councillor at the notorious 2002 Harrow election in which almost all the Liberal Democrat candidates had their nominations rejected, and the Conservatives gained a second seat off Labour at the 2006 election, Brian Gate being the surviving Labour councillor.  In 2010 Labour gained the two Conservative seats; the results show a clear personal vote for Gates but his two running-mates had majorities over the lead Conservative candidate of just 64 and 16 votes.  This marginal profile even continued into last year's GLA election in which Ken beat Boris in the ward's ballot boxes by just four votes (although this figure doesn't include postal votes in which Boris had a handy lead in Harrow); on the other hand, Labour led the Tories by 45% to 29% on the GLA list vote last year.

Defending for Labour is Christine Robson, an NHS psychotherapist who lives in the ward.  Julia Merison, a Conservative councillor for the ward between 2006 and 2010, will try to get her seat back.  Pash Nandhra, who gives an address in Pinner, is the Liberal Democrats' candidate; she was a Lib Dem councillor for a neighbouring ward until falling victim to the 2002 nomination papers scandal, and was also the parliamentary candidate here in 1997.  Jeremy Zeid, a former Conservative councillor in Kenton, is the UKIP candidate, while the Christian Peoples Alliance are not standing again after finishing last in the 2010 election.  Former Lib Dem councillor for the ward Herbert Crossman is standing in this ward for the third consecutive election under the third consecutive label; this time he is an independent after being a UKIPper in 2010 and standing for his own People's Independent Party in 2006.  Finally, Rowan Langley is standing for the Green Party after twice contesting the neighbouring Rayners Lane ward.

I am grateful to Colin Gray for providing information on the candidates in this week's by-election thread on the Vote UK forum, and can recommend his Harrow Elections website (harrow-elections.co.uk) for further information on local elections in Harrow.
