There are two by-elections on Thursday 31st January to round off the month.  One is in south Wales and will be dealt with on the Welsh Elections blog; the other is in a marginal ward in Dudley, in which the Conservatives will be hoping to stop the rot after losing all three of their sitting councillors in the space of a year.

WOLLASTON AND STOURBRIDGE TOWN, Dudley metropolitan borough council, West Midlands; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Malcolm Knowles at the age of 79.  A metallurgist who built a successful engineering business, Knowles had served on Dudley council since 1975 (with a break from 1995 to 2002) and was Mayor of Dudley in 2004/5; he also served on the council's cabinet as lead member for regeneration from 2006 to 2009.

The most south-westerly town in the West Midlands conurbation, Stourbridge can be found about 13 miles west of Birmingham.  It is part of the Black Country region of industrial towns, and Stourbridge's main industry was glassmaking.  Glass isn't made in Stourbridge any more, but it is the home of the British Glass Biennale, a two-yearly exhibition of the state of the current British glass scene.  Stourbridge's other claim to fame is that its Town railway station, which is included within this ward, is at the end of Europe's shortest branch line; change at Stourbridge Junction, three-quarters of a mile away, for all other destinations.

The Wollaston and Stourbridge Town ward runs west along the Bridgnorth road from the town centre, with its strange one-way ring road, to include the suburb of Wollaston.  The deprivation indices suggest that it's a polarised ward; much of Wollaston is a nice area, getting less and deprived as you approach the Shropshire border, while Stourbridge town centre is at the other end of the indices.

That polarisation may be one explanation for the huge turnaround in this ward's election results in the last few years.  In June 2004, the first election on the current ward boundaries, the ward elected one Liberal Democrat and two Conservative councillors.  From then until 2010 the ward was a Conservative-Lib Dem marginal in that order, the Tories gaining the Lib Dem seat in 2008.  It would appear that much of the Lib Dem support was tactical, and the Labour vote never entirely disappeared here; that put Labour in a good position to capitalise on Coalition discontent, and capitalise they did, moving into a strong second place in the 2011 election as the Lib Dem vote collapsed.  Suddenly this ward had turned from a Conservative-Lib Dem marginal into a Conservative-Labour marginal.  Then the wheels came off for the Conservatives as they lost all three seats in the ward in 2012; first one of their councillors died early in the year, creating a double-vacancy election in May at which Labour gained two seats off the Conservatives, contributing to them gaining overall control of Dudley council.  The Tories are now defending their last seat in this by-election.

There is a crowded field here of seven candidates.  After a root-and-branch review of their recent performances the Conservatives have selected Matt Rogers, a tree surgeon who stood in this ward last year.  Barbara Sykes, who stood last year in the safe-Conservative Sedgley ward, is hoping to make Labour's third gain in this ward in the space of nine months.  The Lib Dems have brought out the big guns in the space of former Norton ward councillor Christopher Bramall, who stood in this ward last May and also in the Norton ward by-election in June last year, in which he failed to break 10%.  

Among the minor parties, UKIP are standing a former candidate for this ward: Barbara Deeley stood here in 2007 and 2011.  The Green Party is the only party other than Labour and the Conservatives represented on the council, and 22-year-old Ben Sweeney will hope to become Dudley's second Green councillor.  Ken Griffiths of the BNP is the only candidate to give an address outside Stourbridge (he is from Cradley Heath), while former local radio presenter Russell Eden, who helped to set up a litter-picking group in the town, is an independent candidate.

There are two by-elections on Thursday 31st January to round off the month.  One is in the West Midlands and will be dealt with on the English Elections blog; the other is in a safe Labour ward just north of Bridgend.

BRYNCOCH, Bridgend county borough council, Glamorgan; caused by the death of Labour councillor Pat Penpraze at the age of 69.  Cllr Penpraze had worked as a psychiatric nurse and Unison shop steward, and was first elected to Bridgend council in 2008 after serving for several years on St Brides Minor community council.

This is one of those tiny wards that Wales specialises in.  Bryncoch ward is effectively the eastern half of the larger village of Sarn, described as a large housing estate just north of the M4 motorway.  The village's largest employer these days is probably the McArthur Glen designer outlet on the other side of the motorway, a shopping centre specialising in designer brands at discount prices, together with the Sarn Park motorway service area.  Sarn, together with Bryncethin to the north-east, forms the St Brides Minor community.

As stated, Pat Penpraze was first elected to the ward in 2008 after trying unsuccessfully in 2004, losing out by 101 votes to independent councillor Les Phillips; she got her own back in 2008, defeating Phillips by a similar margin thanks to a split in the independent vote.  In 2012 Penpraze faced only token opposition from the Lib Dems and won by almost three to one.

For the by-election Labour have selected Janice Lewis, who is another of the St Brides Minor community councillors for this ward.  Anita Davies is having a go for the Liberal Democrats; she is a Pendre community councillor and was runner-up in last year's county borough election in Pendre ward.  Tim Thomas, who fought Morfa ward in 2012, has been nominated for Plaid Cymru, while two independent candidates are standing, Shawn Cullen and Michael Quick (who stood last year in Brackla ward).
