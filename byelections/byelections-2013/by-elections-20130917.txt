MAYBURY AND SHEERWATER, Woking borough council, Surrey; caused by the election of Liberal Democrat councillor Mohammed Bashir being declared void on petition.  The election court found that Bashir and his agents had engaged in corrupt and illegal practices at the May 2012 election: they were found to have won the election by entering false names into the electoral register and applying for and using postal votes from those non-existent electors.  Bashir is now disqualified from holding any elective office for five years and has also been struck off the electoral register.

This is a long thin ward in north-eastern Woking, sandwiched between the South Western railway line to the south and the Basingstoke Canal to the north, and also including an area of housing on the south side of the line north of College Road and East Hill.

It may surprise people who know Woking mainly for the HG Wells novel War of the Worlds that Woking has a long-standing Muslim connection: the Shah Jahan Mosque was the first mosque ever built in the UK, described in the election court's judgment [M/336/12, Ali v Bashir and another, https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/170955/response/417533/attach/4/Full%20Executive%20of%20the%20Judgment%2029%20July%202013.pdf] as "a charming small building in the Mughal style, a mini-Taj Mahal plonked down in the Surrey woodlands".  The result of this has been to produce a ward which shares many of the common features of electoral wards with a large Asian Muslim population: party labels within the Asian community start to become secondary to which candidate comes from whose extended family, whose extended family comes from which village in Pakistan or Kashmir, and so on.  Such family ties are not the only things which have been imported from the subcontinent: a senior Labour figure in Woking and former secretary of the Mosque, Sabir Hussain, was quoted in the judgment as saying that

"To many people, seeking electoral success has become important in its own right and commonplace electoral practices prevalent in Pakistan have been imported by some people into Woking.  These practices are often corrupt."

2012 was by no means the first time electoral fraud had been alleged in Maybury and Sheerwater ward.  The CPS had decided not to prosecute allegations on several previous occasions, and Woking council had invited the candidates to sign up to an "acceptable behaviour" protocol in advance of the 2012 election.  Clearly that didn't work.

Previous election results for the ward do bear quite a few of the above hallmarks.  The list below shows some wild gyrations, and it's important to bear in mind not just whch party is represented but which community their candidate is from.  The ward was safe Labour in 2002 and 2003 (it is the strongest Labour ward in Woking) with none of the candidates being from the Asian community.  In 2004 both the Conservatives and Labour nominated Muslim candidates; with a huge rise in turnout compared to 2003, the Conservatives won the seat by 147 votes.  The Tory majority increased to 461 votes in 2006 and the ward looked safe for them.  The final Labour seat in the ward went in 2007, their outgoing councillor Elizabeth Evans finishing a poor third behind Mohammed Bashir for the Liberal Democrats, who was 137 votes behind the winning Conservative candidate Muzaffar Ali.  Bashir came back for the 2008 election and won on a big swing, gaining the seat from the Conservatives.  

The years 2010-2012 saw the three ward councillors successively re-elected with narrow majorities: Tory by 163 votes over the Lib Dems in 2010; Tory by 45 votes over Labour in 2011 with the Lib Dems close behind, all three major parties fielding Muslim candidates for the first time; Lib Dem by 12 votes over Labour in the now-voided 2012 election, the Conservatives falling back badly.  In May this ward formed part of the Woking North county council division, which was narrowly won by the Conservatives over Labour.

Trying to pick up the shattered pieces for the defending Liberal Democrats is Norman Johns, a councillor between 2006 and 2010 for Mount Hermon East ward on the other side of the railway line.  Mohammad Ali, the successful petitioner, has decided not to stand for election again and Stephen Tudhope has taken over as the Labour candidate; he is a management consultant who fought the ward in 2010.  Fighting for the Conservatives is Mohammed Rashid, a former master baker who now runs a taxi firm.  Completing the ballot paper is UKIP candidate Neil Willetts.
