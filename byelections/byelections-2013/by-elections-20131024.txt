Ten by-elections are to be held on 24th October 2013.  Labour have the most to lose with four defences, in Loughborough, in Wigan, on the Wirral, and in Dunfermline.  The Tories will defend seats in West Sussex, Havant and Leicestershire, and will also try to recover a seat in Devon where the retiring councillor had gone Independent.  There is one Lib Dem defence, in Norfolk, and in Scotland's second by-election this week an SNP seat in Hamilton is up for election.

WARNHAM AND RUSPER, West Sussex county council; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Mick Hodgson.  A chartered surveyor by profession, Hodgson had served on the county council since 2001; he had formerly been vice-chairman of the county council and chairman of Warnham parish council.

This is a curiously-shaped rural division, wrapping around the north side of Horsham like a pair of earmuffs; an area of villages with no one settlement dominating.  To the west of Horsham are the parishes of Warnham, Slinfold and Rudgwick, with Rusper lying to the north-east and Colgate to the east of Horsham. 

This is all very Tory countryside and the Conservatives were not seriously challenged here at the 2013 election, although there was a swing from them to UKIP who consolidated their second place in the division.  The three Horsham district council wards covered by the division were all very safe for the Conservatives at the most recent district council election in 2011, and the Tories have held all four district council seats since 2007 when they easily gained the Lib Dem seat in Itchingfield, Slinfold and Warnham ward.

Defending for the Conservatives is Liz Kitchen, who is the long-serving Horsham district councillor for Rusper and Colgate ward and lives in Rusper.  Geoff Stevens, from Billingshurst, tries again for UKIP after his second-placed finish in May.  The other three candidates all give Horsham addresses: they are solicitor and former Horsham district councillor Tony Millson for the Liberal Democrats, who fought a Crawley division in May and failed to crack 100 votes; Green candidate Darrin Green, in this week's first example of nominative determinism; and Labour's Carol Hayton.

WATERLOO, Havant borough council, Hampshire; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor John Hunt due to poor health.

This ward covers the centre of Waterlooville, one of the towns in the South Hampshire conurbation which have merged into each other.  The strange name is believed to have come from the pub in the town centre on the old London-Portsmouth road, the "Heroes of Waterloo"; it is said that many Waterloo veterans settled in the area after disembarking at Portsmouth.  Whatever the truth of this, the town's proximity to Portsmouth has ensured its prosperity; GEC manufactured torpedos here for a while from the 1980s.

The Waterloo ward has voted heavily Conservative throughout the noughties, which makes the first result on these boundaries - an uncontested election in 2002, the Tories winning two seats and the Lib Dems one - rather strange in retrospect.  The Tories gained the Lib Dem seat in 2004 and have not come close to losing since; at the 2012 the Lib Dems fell behind Labour here for the first time this century.  The local county division (Waterloo and Stakes North) is also safely Conservative but UKIP had a decent second-place vote in May's county elections.

Four new candidates will be finally facing their Waterloo in this by-election.  Peter Wade defends for the Conservatives; he is up against Anthony Berry for Labour, the Lib Dems' David Crichton (chairman of the Waterlooville Community Forum) and UKIP's Gary Kerrin (from Hayling Island).

BOVEY, Teignbridge district council, Devon; caused by the resignation of Independent councillor Fernley Holmes, who is retiring after forty years' service on the council.  Holmes was one of the original Teignbridge councillors of 1973 and had served continuously since then.  Although he was sitting as an independent at the time of his retirement he was most recently re-elected as a Conservative.

A market town since ancient times, the "Gateway to the Moor" is named after the Tracey family, lords of the manor following the Norman conquest.  Probably the most important part of the town's history is the Civil War battle of Bovey Heath in January 1646, a decisive Roundhead victory.  The Heath is no longer what it was in 1646 thanks to opencast ball clay mining and the expansion of the village of Heathfield off the A38, the main road through South Devon.  Heathfield and Bovey Tracey form the main population centres in Bovey ward, which also includes the parish of Lustleigh, further up the Bovey valley within the Dartmoor National Park.

Since 2003 the Conservatives have held at least two of the ward's three district council seats.  In 2003 the third seat was held by Holmes himself, who was not opposed by the Tories and topped the poll.  Holmes stood under the Conservative banner in 2007 but the Tories failed to capitalise as the third seat was won by the Lib Dems' Sally Morgan, the local county councillor unil 2009, who topped the poll in a rather close result.  Morgan lost her seat to the Tories in 2011, who then had a clean sweep of the ward's three councillors until Holmes went off and became Independent again.  Another Tory district councillor for the ward, George Gribble, was easily re-elected for the Bovey Tracey Rural county council division this May with UKIP a distant second.

There is no independent candidate in the by-election so the seat us up for grabs.  The Conservatives have selected Bovey Tracey town councillor Avril Kerswell.  The Lib Dems' Charlie West is standing here after contesting the neighbouring Haytor ward in 2011.  Regular Labour candidate Lisa Robillard West is the only candidate from 2011 to try again, while UKIP have selected their county council candidate from May, Bruce Meechan.  All four candidates are from Bovey Tracey.

NORTH WALSHAM EAST, Norfolk county council; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Ed Foss, after just three months in office, due to a change in work commitments.

Off to deepest darkest Norfolk we go.  North Walsham is the largest town in inland North Norfolk with a population of around 12,000; it became a very prosperous textile town in mediaeval times and much of that wealth went into the local church: the fourteenth-century St Nicholas North Walsham is one of the largest parish churches in the UK, even allowing for the fact that its tower is still in a ruined state after collapsing in the eighteenth century.  Another event of significance here in the fourteenth century was the Battle of North Walsham, the last major action in the Peasant's Revolt of 1381.  Since mediaeval times North Walsham is most famous for its association with Horatio Nelson, who was educated at the town's Paston Grammar School until the age of 12.

North Walsham itself provides four-fifths of the electorate in this county division, with the other fifth contained in five parishes (Dilham, Honing, Witton, Walcott and Happisburgh) collected into the deeply rural Happisburgh ward, named after a coastal village but including a signifcant inland area, part of which lies within the Broads National Park.

This is a strongly Lib Dem area, which until May this year was the division of the Lib Dems' county council group leader.  Even in May it was safe; although the Lib Dems only polled 35% of the vote they were 12 points ahead of UKIP with Labour third and the Tories falling from second place to fourth.  The Lib Dems have held all five district council seats in the division for some years, although the most recent district election in 2011 (in which they polled almost 80% in Happisburgh) is not easily comparable as there were no Conservative candidates in any of the wards covered by the division.

Defending for the Lib Dems is Eric Seward, district councillor for North Walsham North ward.  Lynette Comber, from Bodham near Sheringham, tries again for UKIP after her second-place finish in May.  The Labour candidate is Stephen Burke from Happisburgh, co-chairman of the charity Grandparents Plus.  The Tories hope to bounce back with the selection of the deputy leader of North Norfolk district council Rhodri Oliver, who is still in his early twenties; he is a ward councillor in Sheringham.  North Walsham-based Paul Oakes tries again for the Green Party after finishing last in May, and Graham Jones, from Antingham on the road to Cromer, stands as an independent.

LOUGHBOROUGH HASTINGS and SHEPSHED WEST, Charnwood district council, Leicestershire; caused respectively by the resignation of Labour councillor Jitu Choudhury and the death of Conservative councillor Bernard Burr at the age of 82.  Burr was a veteran of local government who was first elected in 1966 to the former Shepshed Urban District Council and had served on and off on Charnwood council since 1987, including as Mayor of Charnwood in 2011/2; a London native, he came to Shepshed to work for the fashion house Jaeger after working in the motor industry and as a semi-professional footballer.

Charnwood is having a rash of by-elections at the moment: there were two in September, and here are two more.  We start off alphabetically in Loughborough Hastings, which is Loughborough's eastern ward, including part of the town centre and based around the preserved Great Central Railway station.  This is a generally low-lying area and more than half of the ward is left empty as flood plain.  Shepshed, on the other hand, is an independent town west of Loughborough on the opposite side of the M1 motorway.

Shepshed West is a key marginal ward on the council.  In the 2011 election the Conservatives did well to hold their two seats with majorities of 66 and 26, after gaining the ward from Labour in 2007 with majorities of 96 and 51.  Loughborough Hastings, by contrast, is safe Labour; at the 2011 election Labour beat the Tories here 66-34 in a straight fight.  May's county council elections had similar results in the two divisions concerned, Labour easily holding Loughborough Hastings and the Tories narrowly holding Shepshed.

The Shepshed West poll is contested only by the three main parties, all of whom have selected candidates who are Shepshed town councillors.  Joan Tassell defends for the Conservatives, Jane Lennie challenges for Labour and Diane Horn for the Liberal Democrats.

For the Loughborough Hastings by-election Labour's defending candidate is Sarah Maynard Smith, who fought her home division (Rothley and Mountsorrel) in May's county council elections.  Regular Conservative candidate Judith Spence (from Barrow upon Soar, where she is a parish councillor) tries again.  The Lib Dems have selected Simon Atkins, UKIP have gone for Quorn-based Andy McWilliam who performed well at a September by-election in another Loughborough ward, and Kevan Stafford stands for the British Democratic Party, a new far-right movement led by former BNP MEP Andrew Brons.

UPTON, Wirral metropolitan borough council, Merseyside; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Sylvia Hodrien due to poor health.

In the geographic centre of the Wirral, Upton these days is essentially that bit of Birkenhead which lies to the west of the M53 motorway.  During Victorian times Upton became associated with the shipping magnate William Inman, owner of the Inman Line, who lived here.  The Upton ward includes Woodchurch, essentially a large post-war council estate built by Birkenhead Corporation, with employment provided by a factory which made spark plugs - this closed in 2006.

This combination of relatively middle-class suburbia (Liverpool city centre is just a quarter of an hour away via the M53 motorway and Wallasey Tunnel) and more working-class social housing makes for a classic key marginal where swings are low.  Add to that its presence in a key marginal parliamentary seat (Wirral West) and you have a hard-fought area.  Despite some close results in the Brown era, Labour have always had the edge over the Tories in this ward; it took the Labour nadir of 2008 for the Conservatives to win, and that win was by only four votes.  Labour convincingly regained the Tory seat at the 2012 election.

Labour have selected a young candidate, Matthew Patrick, to defend the by-election.  The Conservative candidate is Geoffrey Gubb, who fought this ward in 2011 and since then has stood for Merseyside Police and Crime Commissioner.  Also standing are Hoylake-based Jim McGinley for the Green Party and the Lib Dems' Alan Davies, from Prenton.

WINSTANLEY, Wigan metropolitan borough council, Greater Manchester; caused by the death of Labour councillor Rona Winkworth.  Chair of governors at Winstanley primary school, Winkworth had served as Mayor of Wigan in 2008/9.

This is one of those small towns which characterise the Wigan metropolitan borough.  These days Winstanley is essentially a residential and commuter area, just south-west of Wigan on the road to St Helens.

Winstanley was one of the strong areas for the Community Action party, essentially a group of anti-Labour independents led by the Franzen family, which had some strength in Wigan during the Blair and Brown years.  It was one of only two wards won by Community Action in 2008, the last time that party won any seats.  When the current ward boundaries were introduced in 2004 Community Action and Labour split the three seats in Winstanley 2-1, and Labour easily gained the Community Action seats here in 2010 and 2012.

Marie Morgan is the defending Labour candidate for the ward; a customer service worker for RBS in Wigan, she is the wife of Clive Morgan, one of the two remaining councillors for the ward.  Stan Barnes, the Community Action councillor who lost his seat in 2012, wants it back.  Steven Heyes is the Green candidate and, in this week's second example of nominative determinism, the Conservatives have selected former Wigan councillor Michael Winstanley for Winstanley; he is an NHS analyst from Ashton-in-Makerfield and was the Tory candidate for Greater Manchester police and crime commissioner.  Also standing are independent candidate David Bowker, Andrew Collinson for UKIP and John Skipworth for the Liberal Democrats, who are fighting this ward for the first time.

DUNFERMLINE SOUTH, Fife council; caused by the death of Labour councillor Mike Rumney.  Rumney, who had served as a councillor since 1995, was chairman of the council's Dunfermline area committee.

This by-election will be combined with the Scottish Parliamentary by-election for the Dunfermline constituency, which is caused by SNP MSP Bill Walker resigning after being found guilty of 23 charges of domestic assault against three ex-wives.

This ward covers the sort of area you'd expect from the name, a generally residential and light industrial area hard up against the M90 and A823(M) motorways to the east and south of the town.  Effectively capital of Scotland for much of the mediaeval period, Dunfermline's fortunes revived in the early eighteenth century when a linen industry was established in the town.  Today Dunfermline's economy is based on the service sector: BSkyB is the town's largest employer, with Amazon also having a major distribution centre here.  Many of the town's residents commute over the Forth Bridges to Edinburgh; Dunfermline South ward includes Rosyth railway station which has a frequent rail service to Waverley.  With its attractive location, lots of housebuilding has taken place in this ward over the last decade or two.

For many years Dunfermline and by-elections will evoke memories of the 2006 Dunfermline and West Fife parliamentary by-election, which saw a shock Lib Dem gain from Labour despite being held during the interregnum after the resignation of Charles Kennedy.  One of the major issues during that campaign was the tolls on the Forth Road Bridge, which have since been abolished by the SNP administration at Holyrood.  In truth the result shouldn't have been such a shock as the Lib Dems had proven strength in Dunfermline at Fife council level, having won three of the five wards wholly or partly in this area at the 2003 council election (the last one to be held under first-past-the-post).  Under proportional representation, the 2007 election saw the Lib Dems come out on top in the ward's first preferences, with Labour less than four points behind, and win two seats with Labour and the SNP sharing the other two.  The Lib Dem vote collapsed at the 2012 election from 35% to 21%; seeing this result coming after the 2011 Holyrood elections, the Lib Dems gave up their second seat by standing only one candidate.  Labour picked up the gain.  The Lib Dems still led on first preferences in the two Pitcorthie ballot boxes, Labour leading everywhere else.

This by-election will be held under the Alternative Vote as with all Scottish local by-elections, and with Labour polling 43% of the first preferences last year they will be heavily favoured to hold their seat.  Their candidate is Billy Pollock, a civil servant working for the MoD in Rosyth.  The SNP candidate Helen Cannon-Todd, from Dalgety Bay, is campaigning against the proposed closure of Pitcorthie primary school.  Robin Munro, a fraud officer in the finance industry, is standing for the Liberal Democrats.  The Tory candidate David Ross (not to be confused with the Depute Leader of Fife council, a Labour councillor with the same name) is blind and works for a local blind people's charity.  Angela Dixon, the Green candidate here last year, tries again, and Cowdenbeath-based Judith Rideout stands for UKIP.

HAMILTON SOUTH, South Lanarkshire council; caused by the death of SNP councillor Bobby Lawson at the age of 73.  A retired salesman who had also had a career in the Navy, Lawson had served on the council since 2007 following an earlier short-lived term after winning a council by-election in the late 1990s.

Again, this ward is pretty much what it says on the tin, covering southern Hamilton from the edge of the town centre along the road to Strathaven to the edge of the built-up area.  This is a strong Labour area and before the introduction of PR Labour held all four of the predecessor wards, although in the 2003 election they only just beat Lawson in Silvertonhill ward (covering the Silvertonhill, Low Waters and Eddlewood areas above Eddlewood Glen, connected by Silvertonhill Avenue).  In the two elections since proportional representation was introduced Labour have had the votes to elect three out of the four councillors but never stood more than two candidates; this has resulted in the Tories winning a surprise seat at the 2007 election with just 11% of the vote, and the SNP winning a second seat at the 2012 election to split the ward's representation 2/2.

In 2012 Labour polled 52% of the first preferences to 33% for the SNP, who will have their work cut out to hold the seat.  They have selected 20-year-old activist Josh Wilson, who got in trouble in the run-up to last year's council elections for tweeting offensive things to a Celebrity Big Brother contestant.  Labour have selected Stuart Gallacher.  Also standing are Lynne Nailon for the Conservatives, Craig Smith for the Scottish Christian Party (who finished last here last year) and East Kilbride resident Josh Richardson for UKIP.
