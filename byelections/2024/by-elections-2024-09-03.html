"All the right votes, but not necessarily in the right order"

</p><p>
Before we start this week I would like to apologise to Alan Humphries, who was a Labour candidate for last week's Wychavon council by-election in Harvington and Norton ward.  I had incorrectly stated in last week's Preview that Humphries was a Green Party candidate, and I am sorry about that error.  I also regret that my original tweeted apology to Humphries was hijacked by a particularly brainless Twitter troll, who thought this was the perfect time to accuse Humphries of robbing from pensioners, and who refused to withdraw that when I called him out over his behaviour.  It is OK to not like the Labour government's policy towards pensioners; it is not OK to go ad hominem over it.

One by-election on Tuesday 3rd September 2024:
</p><p>
<h2>Priory</h2>
</p><p>
Swale council, Kent; caused by the death of Liberal Democrat councillor Michael Henderson.
</p><p>
Welcome to autumn.  The schools are back, the traffic has returned, and this column has a very busy month ahead of it with 39 by-elections to cover this month.  So let's make an early start with a Tuesday poll, whose unusual timing may be related to the start of the new school year: the only polling station for this by-election is at Davington Primary School, whose new year starts tomorrow.
</p><p>

</p><p>
Davington Primary School is in Faversham, an old port town which is located on a creek off the Swale - the waterway which separates the Isle of Sheppey from the Kent coast.  In mediaeval times Faversham was a junior member of the Cinque Ports, as a limb of Dover, and before that it was an important stopping-point on the Roman road from the Channel and Canterbury to Londinium.  Many pilgrims would have passed through here on the way to Canterbury and to the shrine of Thomas Becket.
</p><p>
In England, important mediaeval towns often had a religious institution or two, founded by and enjoying the patronage of kings and nobles.  Faversham was particularly favoured by King Stephen, who founded the Cluniac Faversham Abbey in 1148, during the Anarchy.  Stephen's wife Queen Matilda, who was countess of Boulogne in her own right, was buried in Faversham Abbey in 1152 and Stephen himself was interred there two years later.  Unfortunately they are not lying in eternal rest: their graves were disturbed when Faversham Abbey was demolished, and a 1964 excavation found their tomb to be empty.
</p><p>
One of King Stephen's last acts was to found another religious house in Faversham.  Davington Priory was established in 1153 as a nunnery, under the Benedictine rule.  The priory became defunct when its last nun died at the time of the dissolution of the monasteries, but some of its buildings survive today.  The priory church's nave is still in use as a parish church, and part of the cloister was converted into a house which was bought in 1982 by Bob Geldof.  Geldof still lives in Davington Priory, which would make him an elector in this by-election.  His many honours include the freedom of the Borough of Swale, which the council awarded him in 1986.
</p><p>
The grounds of the former Davington Priory have long been swallowed up into the town of Faversham.  In more modern times this area was the centre of the British explosives industry, but the gunpowder factories were all closed in the 1930s because they were too close to the Continent.  That left brewing as the town's longest-standing industry: Shepherd Neame claims to be the UK's oldest brewery still in production, with an official foundation date of 1698.
</p><p>
Faversham is divided into four Swale council wards, of which Priory is the northern one.  This is an area with high levels of social renting and a working-class demographic profile; by the standards of the South East region there are unusually high levels here of adults with no qualifications and residents who were born in the UK.
</p><p>
This doesn't translate to a Labour-voting ward.  This is despite the fact that Labour are the largest party on the hung Swale council, which also includes Sittingbourne and the Isle of Sheppey, and they have run the show since 2019 at the head of a coalition which also includes independent and Green councillors.  Swale council's latest composition has 16 Labour councillors, 11 members of the Swale Independents Alliance who are part of the ruling coalition, 10 Conservatives, 4 Lib Dems plus this vacancy, 3 Greens and 2 independents outside the ruling coalition.
</p><p>
Our genial host Ben Walker's model of the 2024 general election results reckons that Priory ward was close three ways between the Conservatives, Labour and Reform UK, with the Conservatives most likely to have carried the ward.  Faversham is the largest town in the Conservative-held Faversham and Mid Kent parliamentary seat, where the new shadow transport secretary Helen Whately narrowly held on in July for a fourth term of office just 1,469 votes ahead of Labour.  But in local elections Faversham is a Liberal Democrat hotspot.  It is represented by the Lib Dems on Kent county council, and all five of the Swale council seats which the Lib Dems won in 2023 were for wards in the town.
</p><p>
Priory ward, which was renamed from "Davington Priory" in 2015, has long been politically associated with Mike Henderson who passed away in May at the age of 79.  Henderson had first stood here in 1988 under the old "Social and Liberal Democrat" label which the party used for a short time after the Liberal/SDP merger, and he was a councillor for Priory or Davington Priory from 1992 to 2000, from 2008 to 2019, and from a September 2021 by-election up to his death.  All of those wins were under the Lib Dem banner apart from 2015, when he stood as an independent without Lib Dem opposition.  Henderson was Mayor of Faversham in 1995-96.  Outside politics he had a successful business career.
</p><p>
Michael Henderson's final re-election in May 2023 was by the comfortable margin of 55-24 over the Conservatives.  Defending that majority for the Lib Dems is Alex Eyre, who represents the ward on Faversham town council: she has had a long career in the financial services industry.  The Conservatives have selected Jack Goodenough, who works as a parliamentary assistant for a Conservative MP.  Also standing are John Griffin for Labour and Jess Valentine for Reform UK, who do seem to be becoming more of a regular feature in local by-elections these days.
