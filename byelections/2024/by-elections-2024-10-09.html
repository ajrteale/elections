One by-election on Wednesday 9th October 2024:
</p><p>
<h2>Machynlleth</h2>
</p><p>
Powys council; caused by the death of independent councillor Mike Williams.
</p><p>
We're in one of the busiest weeks that Andrew's Previews has ever covered.  Our main course tomorrow will have 20 polls taking place, filling vacancies to our local councils in every corner of Great Britain.  Today we have a starter, as we travel to mid-Wales.
</p><p>

</p><p>
You can't get much more central in Wales than Machynlleth, whose population of a bit over 2,000 doesn't do justice to its strategic position.  This is the lowest crossing-point of the River Dyfi, whose estuary is often seen as the dividing line between North and South Wales.  Gwynedd lies to the north of the estuary, and Ceredigion to the south; but Machynlleth instead belongs to the county of Powys, looking east towards Newtown and Welshpool for its services.
</p><p>
The Dyfi Bridge, a fine structure of five stone arches, carried north-south road traffic across the river for centuries until February 2024, when it was relieved by the modern New Dyfi Bridge further upstream.  Machynlleth lies on the Cambrian railway line, with trains arriving here from Shrewsbury or beyond and dividing into two portions for Aberystwyth and Pwllheli.  The Cambrian line was the first British railway line to be fitted with state-of-the-art European Rail Traffic Management System signalling, which is controlled from a suitably modern building next to Machynlleth station.
</p><p>
Machynlleth was also the centre of things six centuries ago, when Owain Glyndŵr convened his Welsh Parliament here in 1404.  The town was already known for its weekly market, which has been held here on Wednesdays since 1291.  And one particular Machynlleth trader went on to become nationally famous: the fashion designer Laura Ashley opened her first shop here in 1961, at 35 Maengwyn Street.
</p><p>

</p><p>
The main road junction in the town centre is dominated by a clock tower, which was erected in 1874 to mark the 21st birthday of Charles Vane-Tempest-Stewart, then known as Viscount Castlereagh.  Vane-Tempest-Stewart entered the House of Lords in 1884 as the sixth Marquess of Londonderry, and he went on to serve in a number of Cabinet roles in the Salisbury and Balfour administrations.  His father George, the fifth Marquess, had moved to Machynlleth in 1846 following his marriage to Mary Cornelia Edwards; in 1850 she inherited from her father the mansion of Plas Machynlleth, and the Londonderry family lived there until 1921 when George and Mary's son Lord Herbert Vane-Tempest was killed in the Abermule train disaster.  After that the Plas became the offices of Machynlleth urban district council, with its grounds turned into a public park; the modern Machynlleth town council got the building back in 2008, and it now houses a restaurant, office and conference facilities.  And, for one day only, Plas Machynlleth is the polling station for today's by-election.
</p><p>
The Londonderry family's Conservative politics haven't always been shared by the residents of Montgomeryshire, which Machynlleth was part of before the creation of Powys in the 1970s.  In fact, the Montgomeryshire parliamentary seat (which had unchanged boundaries from 1918 to 2024) returned Liberal or Liberal Democrat MPs at all but one election from 1880 to 2005 (the exception being 1979).  But then the Liberal Democrat vote collapsed here in 2010 amid bad behaviour by both the Westminster MP Lembit Öpik (left Siân Lloyd for a Cheeky Girl, among other eccentricities) and the Welsh Assembly member Mick Bates (punched a paramedic while drunk).  Montgomeryshire was gained by the Conservatives at the 2010 Westmister and 2011 Assembly elections, and Conservative MS Russell George has been <em>in situ</em> at the Senedd ever since.
</p><p>
By contrast, Wales now has no Conservative MPs left.  The boundary changes for the 2024 Westminster election redrew the seat as "Montgomeryshire and Glyndŵr", creating a constituency that crossed over the Berwyn mountains to take in some working-class areas like Chirk and Rhosllanerchrugog to the south of Wrexham.  The added areas were thought to bring Labour into contention in the only Welsh seat which they had never won, but poll-based modelling during the general election campaign still had Montgomeryshire and Glyndŵr down as the Conservatives' best chance of holding a seat in Wales.
</p><p>
Then the Tory campaign comprehensively fell apart.  Three days before Rishi Sunak's announcement that the general election would be held on 4th July, the Montgomeryshire MP Craig Williams had placed a £100 bet on this year's general election taking place in July.  Williams was Sunak's parliamentary private secretary, and the Gambling Commission launched an investigation into whether this was bet was based on inside information.  The Conservatives were eventually forced to disown Williams, but by that point it was too late to take him off the ballot paper on which he was still listed as the official Conservative candidate.
</p><p>
Montgomeryshire and Glyndŵr ended up as a Labour gain in July on a freak vote split: just 29% of the votes were cast for the winning Labour candidate, against 21% for Reform UK, 18% for the Conservatives, 15% for the Lib Dems and 13% for Plaid Cymru.  When measured by the metric of "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_number_of_parties">effective number of parties</a>", this was the most fragmented result ever seen in a UK parliamentary election.  The seat's new MP Steve Witherden is from the Glyndŵr end of the seat: before entering the Commons he had worked as a teacher and he sat on the NASUWT union's national executive.
</p><p>
Local council elections in mid-Wales have historically tended not to take a lot of notice of whatever is going in Westminster or Cardiff Bay.  In fact it's only very recently that party politics has come to Powys council, which had a majority of independent councillors at every election up to 2017.  Even after the council became hung independents continued to run the county council in coalition with the Conservatives; it took until 2022 for Powys to get a council leader elected on a political party ticket, when the Lib Dems and Labour formed a coalition administration.
</p><p>
This long-standing former independent majority came with one of the most unwelcome features of the first-past-the-post electoral system: unopposed elections.  In the most rural parts of Great Britain wards tend to be tiny in population and tend to be composed of the sort of places where everyone knows everyone else.  Combine this with a non-partisan political culture, and the point is quickly reached where challenging your incumbent councillor at election time is seen as bad form.
</p><p>
We historically saw this effect in the Scottish Highlands and islands, which had large numbers of councillors elected unopposed in the past.  In Scotland this problem was essentially fixed in 2007 by moving local elections over to proportional representation.  Unopposed local elections in rural Scotland are now very rare.
</p><p>
Unopposed local elections in rural Wales, on the other hand, are very common, and Powys is one of the councils worst affected by this.  To take a random example out of the Local Elections Archive Project database, in the 2004 Powys council elections 45 out of the 73 elected councillors didn't even face a contest.  Things have got better since - in 2022 the unopposed returns were down to seven out of 68 - but this sort of thing isn't good for democracy.  In this context it's interesting to note that Powys, along with Gwynedd (another council which often has swathes of unopposed elections), have both recently consulted the public on changing their electoral system to proportional representation, a change which councils in Wales now have the power to make on their own initiative.
</p><p>
Nowehere do we see this lack of democracy more clearly than in Machynlleth.  Mike Williams had been the independent Powys councillor for the town continuously from 1981 until his death in July, and in his 43 years in office he faced a grand total of one contested election.  That was his last re-election in 2022, when Williams defeated Plaid Cymru candidate Alwyn Evans by 53-42.  Williams was clearly extremely well thought-of in Mach, and the Powys council leader James Gibson-Watt may well have been correct when, paying tribute to Williams, he said that "in the countless electoral contests [Williams] faced, I suspect any challenge to him was futile - such was the respect and affection in which he was held".  For decades, nobody took that challenge on.
</p><p>
The by-election to replace Mike Williams, on the other hand, has attracted a large field.  One independent candidate has come forward: that's Williams' cousin Gareth Jones, a long-serving civil servant who has been mayor of Machynlleth and sits on the town council.  Plaid Cymru's (Richard) Alwyn Evans is back for another go after finishing as runner-up two years ago: he is a singing and piano teacher.  And four other candidates have been nominated: in alphabetical order they are Amerjit Dhaliwal for the Green Party, Oliver Lewis for Reform UK, and two local candidates: Dylan Owen for the Lib Dems and Colin Rigby for Labour.
