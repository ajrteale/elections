Two by-elections on 14th March 2024:

<h2>Castle</h2>

Lancaster council; caused by the resignation of Green Party councillor Shelagh McGregor.

We'll start the week in one of the UK's most ancient cities.  Lancaster was founded by the Romans, who erected a Roman fort in the first century AD on a hill overlooking the lowest crossing-point of the River Lune.  The Roman fort's name is lost to history.  It was rebuilt a number of times and its only surviving section - the Wery Wall, a lump of rubble identified as part of the fort in 1950 - dates from the 4th century.  Roman bathhouses have been excavated nearby, and in 2023 a group of Lancaster University students on a geophysics training exercise found evidence for what is thought to be a Romano-Celtic temple.

Most of the Roman fort's site is now occupied by Lancaster Castle, which dates from at least the thirteenth century and may well be older than that.  It saw action during a Scottish invasion in 1389 and was besieged in the English Civil War, but Lancaster Castle is best known to history as Lancashire's traditional centre for law and justice.  The castle was used as a prison up to 2011, and it is still home to Lancaster crown court to this day; because the prison and court were both within the castle walls, Lancaster was a popular venue for trials which required high security.  Among those who have had justice meted out to them here were the ten Pendle Witches, who were sentenced to death for withcraft in this castle in 1612.  Today the Duchy of Lancaster, which owns the castle, provides guided tours for casual visitors.

Lancaster Castle lies on the western edge of the city centre, whose area forms Castle ward.  This was once a port, and there are still some fine Georgian buildings at St George's Quay on the riverside dating from that era; one of them houses the Lancaster Maritime Museum.  In more recent years the city's economy has been supported by Lancaster University, a plate-glass 1960s institution; the university has its own dedicated campus on the southern edge of the city, but a number of its departments and many of its students are based in the city centre.  In the 2021 census Castle ward made the top 60 wards in England and Wales for the 18-29 age bracket (46.4%) and for those with A-level or equivalent qualifications but not (yet) further (35.3%); 43% of its adults were full-time students, and 22% worked in the education sector.  Students travelling to Lancaster will often arrive or pass through here: the city's intercity railway station, on the West Coast main line, lies within the ward boundary and was once known as Lancaster Castle.

This youthful demographic leads to left-wing politics.  But Lancaster council isn't just the city proper: it also takes in the faded seaside resort of Morecambe, the small railway town of Carnforth and a large rural hinterland, resulting in the council being more or less permanently hung.  The 2023 Lancaster elections returned 24 Labour councillors, 21 Greens, 7 Lib Dems, 5 Conservatives, 3 Morecambe Bay Indepndents and 1 other independent; a traffic-light coalition is in place under a Labour leader.

Castle ward is safely in the Green column in city council elections: in 2023 the Green Party slate beat Labour here 59-29.  At county council level the ward is split betwen the Lancaster Central division, which is safe Green, and Lancaster East which is a Labour-Green marginal; confusingly, the city centre is in Lancaster East rather than Lancaster Central.  The ward is currently part of the Lancaster and Fleetwood parliamentary seat, a marginal constituency which has been represented since 2015 by Labour backbencher Cat Smith; but the forthcoming boundary changes will transform her seat into Lancaster and Wyre, transferring Fleetwood out and strongly Tory areas around Garstang in.  Projections are that this wipes out the small Labour majority: Lancaster and Wyre is projected to be notionally Conservative, so Cat Smith will have to gain her seat all over again if she wants to stay in Parliament.

Lancaster city council has had a lot of by-elections in recent years, so it's not too surprising for this column to find itself back in the city within 12 months of the last ordinary election.  This time we are finding a replacement for Green councillor Shelagh McGregor, who resigned from the council after less than a year in office.  She is returning to her former home in East Yorkshire to care for family members.  There is another vacancy on the city council, following the recent death of a Labour councillor for Carnforth, so Andrew's Previews will be back in this area again in the not too distant future.

This by-election features an all-student ballot paper of four candidates.  Defending for the Green Party is Izzy Metcalf-Riener, who graduated from Lancaster University last summer with a degree in geography and Spanish; she is now reading for a Masters in environment, culture and society.  The Labour candidate is Emily Jones, who is an undergraduate student reading history and politics.  Also standing are Daniel Kirk for the Cosnervatives and Cormac Evans for the Liberal Democrats.

<h2>Cricklade and Latton</h2>

Wiltshire council; cauesd by the death of Liberal Democrat councillor Bob Jones.

And now for something completely different, as we travel to the northern border of Wiltshire.  This lies in the Thames valley, and Cricklade is described as the highest town on the Thames: it is located at the point where the Roman Ermin Way crossed the river.  The ward straddles both sides of the Thames, with Cricklade itself to the south and the village of Latton and the parish of Marston Meysey to the north; both of the latter form salients of Witlshire which are surrounded on three sides by Gloucestershire.

Cricklade's strategic location made it important enough to be an ancient borough which elected two MPs to Parliament.  In the eighteenth century this was a notorious rotten borough, with frequent disputes over the franchise and the borough boundary, attempts to control the voters by buying tenements in the town, and good old-fashioned bribery.  To give but three examples: the 1774 and 1775 elections in Cricklade were voided by Parliament due to concerns over partiality and malpractice by the returning officer, who was in the pocket of the lord of the manor - a post which was frequently bought and sold by people who wanted to control the town's elections.  Then the 1780 election resulted in 113 voters being tried at Salisbury assizes for corruption, with 83 voters and an election agent being found guilty of bribery.

This was the final straw for Parliament, and the House resolved to punish Cricklade for its corrupation.  An Act of 1782 smeant that the Cricklade borough had its franchise extended to all forty-shilling freeholders in the hundreds of Highworth, Cricklade, Staple, Kingsbridge and Malmesbury, increasing the electorate from around 130 to around 800.  Effectively it was turned into a county constituency.  Its area included a small village called Swindon, which grew rapidly in population during the nineteenth century when it became the centre for the locomotive works of the Great Western Railway.  Sir Daniel Gooch, the GWR's chairman, served as a Conservative MP for Cricklade from 1865 until it was finally disenfranchised in 1885; however, Cricklade lived on as a county constituency name until 1918.

The local MP here now is James Gray, who has been the Conservative MP for North Wiltshire since 1997.  This seat will disappear at the next election, at which Cricklade will transfer into a new South Cotswolds parliamentary seat straddling the Gloucestershire-Wiltshire bounary.  Like the old North Wiltshire this is projected to be a safe Conservative seat, and Gray will seek re-election there within the next year.

The Cricklade and Latton ward has been in Liberal Democrat hands since Wiltshire's local government was reorganised in 2009.  Bob Jones MBE had been the local councillor since 2013, after coming a close second as an independent candidate in 2009.  He was re-elected for his third and final term of office in 2021, winning a straight fight with the Conservatives by an increased majority of 61-39.  Jones, who suffered a fatal heart attack in January, was also a Cricklade town councillor and vice-chairman of the Dorset and Wiltshire Fire Authority.

A hard act to follow for the new Lib Dem candidate Nick Dye, who is a business analyst and Cricklade town councillor.  The Conservatives have reselected their losing candidate from 2021 Luke Jowett, who works as a customer services professional for Thames Water.  There will not be a straight fight this time, as also standing are John Barnes for Labour and Anna Marie for the Green Party.
