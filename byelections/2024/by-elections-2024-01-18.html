Six by-elections on 18th January 2024:
</p><p>
<h2>Hampton North; and<br>
Teddington</h2>
</p><p>
Richmond upon Thames council, London; caused respectively by the deaths of Conservative councillor Geoffrey Samuel and Liberal Democrat councillor Martin Elengorn.
</p><p>
This week is going to be a bit of a London special with four of today's six local by-elections taking place in the capital.  For two of these we've come to Richmond upon Thames, the only borough which spans both sides of the river: both polls today are on the north (here actually west) or Middlesex side of the Thames.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/richmond-thames-teddington.png" alt="Richmond upon Thames, Teddington" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
The River Thames is tidal up to Teddington Lock, at which point there is a footbridge crossing the river.  On the riverside there are a large number of moorings for boats, rowing club houses and even a lifeboat station.  There's also a lot of rather nice and rather expensive riverside housing here, some of which was rather recently built on the site previously occupied by the Teddington TV studios.
</p><p>
The centre of Teddington itself lies away from the river close to Teddington railway station, which is on the Kingston Loop line from Waterloo.  To the south of the town centre is the large open space of Bushy Park, which has had a major role in sporting history.  This park is still the home of Teddington Hockey Club, which has been playing here since 1871 and effectively created the modern game of field hockey, while in 2004 the original Parkrun took place here.  Parkrun started off as the "Bushy Park Time Trial", and its first running on 2nd October 2004 attracted thirteen runners and three volunteers.
</p><p>
Bushy Park is a Royal Park, the second-largest of the eight Royal Parks in London (after Richmond), and it was once a royal residence.  The seventeenth-century stately home of Bushy House was built as a residence for the park ranger, and previous rangers to live here include the eighteenth-century prime minister Lord North and King William IV, who was at Bushy House when a messenger arrived early in the morning of 26th June 1830 with the news that William's brother George IV had died and he was now king.  Legend has it that William went back to bed on hearing the news, saying that he had always wanted to sleep with a queen.
</p><p>
Since 1902 Bushy House has been in scientific use as the home of the National Physical Laboratory, whose research complex occupies a large corner of Teddington.  The NPL is the UK's national centre for measurement standards: it houses the three British copies of the prototype kilogram weight, and it broadcasts the UK's atomic time radio signal from a transmitter in Cumbria.  Previous NPL work is also very important to what you are reading now: the concept of packet switching, upon which the modern internet is built, was developed by NPL scientist Donald Davies and first made to work here in Teddington during the mid-1960s.  The NPL's internal computer network first operated in 1969.
</p><p>
This is a comfortably middle-class area of London.  Teddington makes the top 100 wards in England and Wales for adult residents with degree-level qualifications (63.8%); despite the demise of the TV studios, it's also in the top 100 for people working in the arts, entertainment or recreation (5.7%).  Teddington ward also makes the top 30 in England and Wales for households with precisely one car or van (52.9%).
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/richmond-thames-hampton-n.png" alt="Richmond upon Thames, Hampton N" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
The Hampton North ward is another middle-class residential area a couple of miles to the west of Twickenham.  Most of this area has been built on, although there is still the open space of Hampton Common at one end of the ward.  A fair amount of the ward is occupied by two private schools, Hampton School (for boys) and the neighbouring Lady Eleanor Holles School (for girls).  Former pupils of the latter school include the Radio 1 DJ Annie Nightingale, who had a scholarship to Lady Eleanor Holles School and was still working on the radio until just a month before her death last week.  Hampton School educated the former Conservative home secretary Kenneth Baker and the long-serving Huddersfield MP (and oldest present Labour MP) Barry Sheerman.
</p><p>
However, local politics in this area are not dominated by either the Conservatives or Labour right now.  Teddington and Hampton North wards are both part of the Twickenham parliamentary seat, which has voted Liberal Democrat in every election since 1997 with the exception of the party's near-wipeout in 2015.  Since 2019 the MP here has been Munira Wilson, the Lib Dems' education spokeswoman; she took the seat over from the former party leader Sir Vince Cable.
</p><p>
The local authority here is the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames, which has often been closely fought between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats in this century,  But those days of close contests appear to be over for now: the 2022 Richmond elections returned a massive Lib Dem majority with 48 Liberal Democrat councillors; 5 Greens who, as we shall see, owe their seats to an electoral pact with the Lib Dems; and just one Conservative.
</p><p>
That Tory councillor was Geoffrey Samuel, whose death in November 2023 at the age of 92 marked the end of an era in London politics.  Samuel was thought to the the UK's oldest local councillor, and he was definitely the last remaining councillor whose service went back to before the reorganisation of London's local government.  He was first elected all the way back in 1957 to what was then Twickenham borough council, and he had continuous service in Hampton North (and the predecessor ward of Hampton Hill) since 1998.  That's no mean feat, given that Hampton North is a hard-fought traditional marginal ward which has often returned split representation between the Conservatives and Lib Dems.  Geoffrey Samuel was deputy leader of the council from 2010 to 2017 while the Conservatives were in control; before his retirement from work he been a school headmaster for over twenty years.  We can see some of that in Samuel's response to the Lib Dem group leader asking him at the 2022 count what the party had to do to beat him: "try harder".
</p><p>
Hampton North was a ward where the Lib Dem-Green electoral pact in Richmond upon Thames probably went wrong in May 2022.  The Lib Dems stood a two-person slate which won the first two seats easily with 33%; but their support did not transfer to the Green candidate who finished on 21%, behind the 24% polled by Samuel who won the final seat at the head of the Conservative slate.  Avril Coelho, an outgoing Lib Dem councillor for the ward, sought re-election as an independent and polled 14%.  There's a lesson here for those who favour alliances between different parties, whether they are on the left or the right of politics: do not assume that your favoured party's votes will transfer en bloc to another party, because voters are more intelligent, more complicated and more discriminating than that.
</p><p>
Teddington is a very safe Liberal Democrat ward which was not part of the pact.  In 2022 the Lib Dem slate won here with a 67-22 lead over the Conservatives.  Again, the by-election here is to replace a very long-serving councillor.  Martin Elengorn, who passed away in November at the age of 79, had represented Teddington ward continuously since 1982 and was the longest continuously-serving member of Richmond upon Thames council.
</p><p>
To take the Teddington candidate list first, the defending Lib Dem candidate is Richard Baker who previously served as a councillor for this ward from 2018 to 2022 when he stood down.  The Conservatives have selected Elizabeth Foster, who works with adults with leaning disabilities: she previously contested Teddington ward in 2014 and 2018.  Also standing are James Thomson for Labour, Chantal Kerr-Sheppard for the Green Party and independent candidate Revd Dominic Stockford, who contested this ward as a UKIP candidate in 2014 and has since stood in other elections on the Christian Peoples Alliance and Heritage Party tickets.  Presumably Two-Ton Ted from Teddington was too busy driving his baker's van to put in a set of nomination papers.
</p><p>
The Hampton North by-election looks like it will be far more closely-fought, given that the Conservatives need to win here to stay on Richmond council.  Their defending candidate is Nupur Majumdar, a businesswoman who lives in the ward and was an unsuccessful Conservative candidate here last time.  Also living within the ward is the Lib Dem candidate Carey Bishop; she is a former magistrate who works for her family's management company.  The Green Party have selected Danielle Coleman, who gives an address over the river in Richmond proper.  Labour's Sam Cullen completes the Hampton North ballot paper.

We now cross to the south of the river and find ourselves in the borough where Normal Rules Did Not Apply.  From 1978 to 2022 Wandsworth was the Tory Flagship borough in London, holding firm for the Conservatives while many similar areas of Inner London fell out of the party's grasp long ago.  An aggressive low-council-tax policy was a major part of the Wandsworth Conservatives' appeal, and the strength of this can be seen by the fact that in 2002 the borough had a full slate of Labour MPs and a 50-10 Conservative lead on the council.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/wandsworth-tooting-bdwy-2024.png" alt="Wandsworth, Tooting Bdwy" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
The revolution came and the Wandsworth Conservatives' luck finally ran out two years ago, with the 2022 borough elections returning 35 Labour councillors, 22 Conservatives and an independent.  The Labour majority includes Tooting Broadway ward which is one of the longest-standing Labour parts of the borough: Tooting, the main predecessor ward, had returned Labour councillors at every election this century.  Tooting Broadway ward is centred on the Underground station of that name, and its largest employer is St George's Hospital.
</p><p>
The selection of wards where local by-elections come up is to all intents and purposes random, and randomness being what it is that means there are some places which come up in this column over and over again.  Tooting is one of those areas with a high councillor attrition rate, and this column has previewed past by-elections in the previous Tooting ward in 2016 (<em>Andrew's Previews 2016</em>, page 168) and in the present Tooting Broadway ward two years ago (<em>Andrew's Previews 2022</em>, page 340).  In both of those pieces I noted that St George's is a teaching hospital, part of the University of London.  As a result, the ward's demographics are skewed by a large number of students living in the area.  Famous students and staff to have come out of St George's include the vaccination pioneer Edward Jenner, the mathematician and Egyptologist Thomas Young, the present Tooting MP Rosena Allin-Khan, the comedian Harry Hill and the ITV Chaser Paul Sinha.
</p><p>
Your columnist has known Paul for some years through the quiz circuit.  For the moment, he is not letting his Parkinson's diagnosis stop him competing in that game at the highest level, as those unlucky enough to be playing against him on <em>The Chase</em> or in some other quiz soon find out.  He's also managed to put together a memoir with the puntastic title <em>One Sinha Lifetime</em>, which is due for publication next month.  Sinha is also one of the top-ranked players for the most decorated team in the history of the Zoom-based Online Quiz League, "Quiz Machine Kills Fascists".  Wolfie Smith would no doubt approve.
</p><p>
In 2022 the Labour slate in Tooting Broadway ward defeated the Conservatives by a 61-19 margin.  The elected candidates included Andy Gibbons, a retired teacher who had sat as a member of Wandsworth council for various Tooting wards since 1994.  Gibbons had been deputy leader of Wandsworth Labour, but he never got the chance to fully enjoy finally being part of a majority Labour administration in the borough: he passed away less than three weeks after the election.  The resulting by-election in July 2022 gave a Labour lead over the Conservatives of 62-21 - very little change from two months previously.
</p><p>
The voters of Tooting Broadway are now being called out again for the second by-election of this term following the resignation of Labour councillor Kate Forbes, who has been a Wandsworth councillor since 2018: she was originally elected for Graveney ward, before transferring here in 2022 following ward boundary changes.  Forbes was previously a staffer for Rosena Allin-Khan MP, but she has now taken a job working for Sadiq Khan in City Hall; this is a politically-restricted job, and as such Forbes has had to give up her council seat.
</p><p>
Defending this by-election for Labour is Sean Lawless, who runs Rosena Allin-Khan's office and also ran her Labour Party deputy leadership campaign in 2020.  The Conservative candidate is Otto Jacobssen, who is the chief financial officer of a PR firm that works with crypto, blockchain and financial technology clients.  Jacobssen, who is originally from Sweden, has taken the unusual step of referencing Wolfie Smith in his campaign material; one wonders whether the Tooting Popular Front would entirely approve.  Completing the ballot paper are Nick Humberstone for the Green Party and Thillainathan Haren for the Lib Dems.

<h2>Cazenove</h2>
</p><p>
Hackney council, London; caused by the election of Labour councillor Caroline Woodley as mayor of the borough.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/hackney-cazenove.png" alt="Hackney, Cazenove" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
For our final London by-election of the week we travel north of the river.  Cazenove ward doesn't take its name from the former investment bank of that name, which was bought by JPMorgan Chase in 2009; instead the name refers to Cazenove Road which crosses the ward from west to east.  This is an almost entirely built-up area lying between the A10 Stamford Hill to the west and the Upper Clapton Road to the east.  Stoke Newington railway station, served by London Overground trains from Liverpool Street to Enfield and Cheshunt, lies within the boundary.
</p><p>
Hackney is a generally poor part of London and Cazenove ward is no particular exception to that, but its politics are rather different to the rest of Hackney.  This is one of the wards which covers the Haredi Jewish enclave around Stamford Hill, and in the 2021 census Cazenove ward was 23.9% Jewish - the 16th highest figure for any ward in England and Wales.  Orthodox Jews tend to have large families, and Cazenove makes the top 70 wards in England and Wales for children under 16 (27.6%).  The ward also ranks 4th in England and Wales for part-time employment (22.1%), 10th for those working in the property and real estate sector (4.7%), and 61st for those working in education (19.2%).
</p><p>
The local MP here is Diane Abbott, who has represented the very safe Labour seat of Hackney North and Stoke Newington since 1987.  Abbott rose to the heights of shadow home secretary in the Corbyn shadow cabinet, but she is currently suspended from the Labour whip for writing (in a letter to the <em>Observer</em>) that Jewish, Irish and traveller people experience a different kind of racism to black people.  Diane Abbott turned 70 last autumn and this column understands that she's not currently in the best of health, so it's not impossible that we've seen her last re-election.
</p><p>
Trouble for Hackney Labour is not confined to Diane Abbott, as we can see from the fact that this by-election is taking place at all.  The borough has used the elected mayoral system since 2002, and all mayors of Hackney to date have been Labour.  However, last year the mayor Philip Glanville was forced to resign over his association with former Hackney Labour figure Tom Dewey, who resigned from the council almost immediately upon his election in 2022 and was subsequently prosecuted for child porn offences.  A mayoral by-election took place in November 2023 at which the defending Labour candidate was Caroline Woodley, Labour councillor for Cazenove ward; she won the by-election with 50% of the vote against 24% for the Green Party and 14% for the Conservatives.  As a result of Woodley being elected as mayor, her council seat was automatically vacated resulting in this by-election.
</p><p>
We see this Labour versus Green battle also in the 2021 London Mayor and Assembly elections.  With the caveat that these figures do not include postal voters, Cazenove ward gave 63% to Labour's Sadiq Khan with the Green mayoral candidate Siân Berry finishing in second place on 17%.  In the London Members ballot Cazenove's ballot boxes gave 49% to Labour, 26% to the Green Party and 9% and third place to the Women's Equality Party, one of the latter's best results in the capital.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2022/hackney22.png" alt="Hackney, 2022" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
However, in Hackney council elections Cazenove ward is closely fought between Labour and the Liberal Democrats, who won the ward in 2014 (when the current boundaries were introduced) and remain within striking distance.  In the 2022 borough elections the Labour slate won all three seats with 43%, the Lib Dems polled 37% and the Greens 12%.
</p><p>
Labour's campaign to defend this by-election has run into all sorts of trouble. The issue is their defending candidate Laura Pascal, who was described by the <em>Hackney Gazette</em>'s candidate profile (<a href="https://www.hackneygazette.co.uk/news/24046190.candidates-hackney-council-cazenove-ward-by-election/">link</a>) as a "self-professed feminist" and "policy wonk".  It appears it's the feminism that's at the root of the problem: the London regional branch of Labour suspended Pascal last week following a number of complaints about transphobia, and didn't reinstate her until yesterday after she apologised to anybody who had been offended by her social media activity. By the time of her suspension it was, of course, far too late to take Pascal off the ballot. Hoping to capitalise on all this disarray in the Labour campaign is the Lib Dems' Dave Raval, who was the party's candidate for mayor of Hackney in a September 2016 by-election; he runs a loft insulation/conversion firm and is chair of the party's London candidates committee.  Standing for the Greens is Tamara Micner, who is a Yiddish teacher and playwright.  The Conservatives are usually also-rans in Cazenove, but this time they might have secured something of a coup by recruiting to their banner Ian Sharer, who was runner-up here in 2022 at the head of the Lib Dem slate and is a former Lib Dem councillor for this ward; Sharer completes the ballot paper under his new political colours.

<h2>Warwick All Saints and Woodloes</h2>
</p><p>
Warwick council; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Raj Kang.
</p><p>
We now move north to the Midlands and to the town of Warwick, which still gives its name to an English county but has been overtaken in size by several other towns within Warwickshire.  Rugby, Nuneaton and Leamington Spa all have larger populations, to say nothing of Birmingham and Coventry.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/warwick-all-ss-woodloes.png" alt="Warwick, Warwick All SS/Woodloes" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Modern Warwick is a rather prosperous town, with good road links to the major conurbations of the West
Midlands supplemented by lots of high-end employment.  For example, All Saints and Woodloes ward is largely a residential area covering Warwick town north of the Grand Union Canal - but it also includes a large office and IT complex run by IBM.
</p><p>
Warwick effectively forms a single urban area with the neighbouring town of Leamington Spa, which it's fair to say is more politically left-wing - partly because Leamington Spa has a lot of Warwick University students.  The Warwick and Leamington parliamentary seat, which is tightly drawn around the urban area, was gained by Labour in 2017 and held in December 2019 with almost no swing.  A majority of 789 votes (possibly a little more after the boundary changes) means Labour can't afford to be complacent here, but this area is clearly trending leftwards.
</p><p>
As we can see from looking at the electoral history of Warwick All Saints and Woodloes ward, which was drawn up for the 2019 Warwick election: however, the ward has the same boundaries as the Warwick North division of the county council, so we can compare county and district results directly.  The area voted Conservative narrowly in the 2017 county and 2019 district elections, but was gained by Labour in 2021 (which was a good Conservative year generally) and in 2023 (which wasn't).  The Conservatives collapsed across the district in the 2023 Warwick council elections and now only hold six out of 44 seats; the Greens are the largest party on 14, Labour have 10 plus this vacancy, the Lib Dems are on 10 and the other three seats are held by the Whitnash Residents Association.  A coalition of Green and Labour councillors is running the show.  As stated, the Labour total includes the three seats in Warwick All Saints and Woodloes, which was not particularly close in the end: the 2023 votes here were 44% for the Labour slate, 34% for the Conservatives and 13% for the Greens.
</p><p>
This by-election is to replace Labour councillor Raj Kang, who resigned in November for personal reasons.  Labour have selected as their defending candidate Claire Wightman, who describes herself as a dedicated wife and mum who works at the University of Warwick.  Standing for the Conservatives is Jody Tracey, who lost his seat in this ward last year and wants it back.  There is no Green candidate even though the Greens are the largest party on the council, so the Lib Dems' Laurence Byrne is the only other candidate.  Perhaps thankfully, it appears that this time Kang will not be replaced by Kodos.

<h2>Stannington</h2>
</p><p>
Sheffield council, South Yorkshire; caused by the death of Liberal Democrat councillor Vickie Priestley.

It's back to the big city for our final by-election of the week, although you might be forgiven for not realising this.  Stannington itself is a western suburb of Sheffield, which lies on relative high ground between the Rivelin valley to the south and the Loxley valley to the north.  These were once very industrial places, but the Rivelin in particular is now quiet and wooded and something of a beauty spot for the people of Sheffield.  Robin Hood, who was allegedly born in the Loxley valley in the 12th century, might be nonplussed at what has happened to this area since.

</p><p>
Stannington proper was only incorporated into Sheffield in 1974 and much of this ward is still part of Bradfield parish.  This extends some miles to the west and covers a huge area of moorland to the west of Sheffield's built-up area.  Most of this moorland is part of the Peak District National Park, with only a few scattered villages: High and Low Bradfield, Dungworth and Worrall are the main population centres here, such as they are.  This is all administered by Sheffield city council, which is why travellers entering the ward from the A57 Snake Pass road will pass a sign welcoming them to the city with not a single house in sight.
</p><p>
The economy of the upland parts of the ward is dominated by hill farming, grouse shooting and rain: there are a number of reservoirs here which provide water for Sheffield.  The ward overall doesn't really have the professional demographic associated with the Sheffield Hallam parliamentary seat, which it is part of.
</p><p>
Sheffield Hallam overall is the least-deprived Labour constituency in the country, and by quite a long way.  It's been a Labour seat since 2017 (and only since 2017) when the former Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg was defeated.  The Labour MP who was elected then turned out to be an imbecile who is now serving a four-year prison sentence for fraud, and he left the party in 2018; a new Labour candidate, Olivia Blake, then held the Hallam constituency in 2019 with a majority of 712 votes over the Lib Dems and not much swing against the party.  Blake was previously deputy leader of Sheffield council, and her mother Baroness Blake of Leeds was until recently the leader of Leeds city council.
</p><p>
In local elections Stannington ward has voted Liberal Democrat since its creation in 2004; a boundary review in 2016 left the seat unchanged.  Labour came within six votes of winning in 2011 but that was their high-water mark: last year's city council elections gave 52% to the Lib Dems, 24% to Labour and 13% to the Conservatives.  The city council overall is hung, with the latest count giving 31 Labour councillors, 28 Lib Dems plus this vacancy, 14 Greens, 8 members of a Labour splinter group and a single Conservative.  Sheffield has very complicated governance arrangements, but it's fair to say that all parties are involved in the administration to some extent.
</p><p>
This by-election is to replace long-serving Liberal Democrat councillor Vickie Priestley, who passed away in November.  Priestley was first elected for Walkley ward in 2000, lost her seat there in 2002, and had represented Stannington ward since its creation in 2004.  She was Lord Mayor of Sheffield in 2013-14.
</p><p>
Defending for the Liberal Democrats is Will Sapwell, who is an NHS doctor specialising in cardiology; he also teaches medicine at Sheffield University.  He contested the neighbouring Hillsborough ward last year.  The Labour candidate is Lewis Dagnall, who was previously a councillor for Gleadless Valley ward in the south of the city from 2016 to 2021; he is Olivia Blake MP's husband.  Standing for the Conservatives is Ben Woollard, who also contested this ward in 2023 and 2022.  Chris Bragg of the Green Party and Rod Rodgers of the continuing Liberal Party complete an all-male ballot paper.
