<h2>Marsh Mill</h2>

Wyre council, Lancashire; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Henry Jackson.

It says something for just how far the Conservatives have fallen that, out of the 44 by-elections on your columnist's list for November 2024, the Tories are defending only two.  Both of them are taking place today in the same parliamentary constituency, Blackpool North and Fleetwood.

We'll start with a ward in the town of Thornton-Cleveleys, which is essentially a northern extension of Blackpool with which it forms a continuous urban area.  Cleveleys lies immediately north of Blackpool on the Fylde coastline, while Thornton is an older village to the east which once had year-round employment from the salt and chemical works at Burn Naze.  Originally Thornton was an agricultural village, and some of the produce from the local fields ended up in the Marsh Mill: this is a large and well-preserved windmill in Thornton town centre, which has stood since 1794 and was still grinding corn into the 1920s.  The windmill has given its name to the electoral ward covering the south and west of Thornton.

As stated, Marsh Mill ward is within the Blackpool North and Fleetwood constituency.  This seat was reconstituted in this year's boundary changes, with the town of Fleetwood moving back here after being (rather dubiously) linksd with Lancaster in 2010-24.  Fleetwood has a decent Labour vote, and this boundary change was not good news for Conservative MP Paul Maynard who had represented Blackpool North and Cleveleys since 2010.  Maynard had had a number of junior ministerial roles over the years, finishing up as minister for pensions - which is appropriate, given that the DWP has historically been a major employer in Blackpool.  He had also got into trouble with the House of Commons authorities over his expense claims, and he went down to defeat in July.

Blackpool North and Fleetwood's new MP is Labour's Lorraine Beavers, who for the time being is still a Wyre councillor and Lancashire county councillor as well.  The Wyre local government district is named after the River Wyre and covers it Fleetwood, Thornton-Cleveleys, Poulton-le-Fylde and a rural area to the east including Garstang.  With the exception of Fleetwood, all of these are strongly Conservative areas in council elections: Wyre council is now one of just three councils in north-west England with Conservative majorities, the other two being neighbouring Fylde and Lancashire county council.  Marsh Mill ward is part of the Conservative majority: the 2023 council elections here saw the Conservatives defeat Labour 58-42.  The ward is split between two Lancashire county divisions which are also safely Conservative.

However, only one of the three Conservative councillors elected here in 2023 - Paul Ellison - is still in the party.  Ellison's ward colleague David Higgs defected to Reform UK in June, while Henry Jackson quit both the council and the Conservatives in Septembner.  So there's a bit of work to do here for the defending Conservative candidate Howard Ballard, who previously represented the neighbouring Bourne ward on Wyre council until he lost his seat to Labour last year.  The Labour candidate is James Mason.  This time we do not have a straight fight, with James Crawford being nominated for Reform UK and Caroline Montague for the Greens.

<h2>Bispham</h2>

Blackpool council, Lancashire; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Tony Warne.

Staying within the Blackpool North and Fleetwood constituency, we now enter Blackpool proper for a walk along the prom.  Bispham (pronounced Bispam, not Bisfam) is a lot older than Blackpool, and it was mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 - in the West Riding of Yorkshire chapter, because Lancashire has not been invented then.  Blackpool itself is first mentioned as a placename in the register of Bispham parish church, from a 1602 baptismal record.  Bispham with Norbreck was a separate urban district into the 20th century, before it was finally absorbed into Blackpool in 1918.

The present Bispham ward runs along the seafront, where it is served by the Blackpool Tramway stops at Cavendish Road, Bispham and Sandhurst Avenue.  It marks the northern end of that festival of electric light known as the Illuminations, which are in full swing at the moment and will continue until 5th January.  Just off the northern boundary of the ward is the Norbreck Castle hotel, which was the location of the 1988 conference where the Liberal Party and SDP voted to merge and doesn't look like it's had a penny spent on it since.  At the time of writing the Norbreck Castle was ranked by Tripadvisor as 86th out of 93 hotels in Blackpool, which this column finds surprising: there are <em>seven</em> worse hotels here?

Blackpool council is run by Labour, who won a 28-14 majority over the Conservatives at the 2023 election;. However, last month Labour lost a by-election in the town's Marton ward to Reform UK, only the second time that Reform UK have ever won a principal council by-election.  This time the Conservatives are defending, as Bispham ward is consistently in their column - but it was very close in 2023, with the Conservatives defeating Labour in a straight fight by 52-48.  Conservative councillor Tony Warne, who was first elected in 2023, stepped down in September due to work commitments.

Defending this seat for the Conservatives is Lynda Watson, who is a retired teacher and lecturer.  Labour have selected Joel McKevitt, who works in the NHS.  As in Marsh Mill, we do not have a straight fight this time: also standing are William Banks for Reform UK, Kevan Benfold for the Lib Dems, independent candidate Rick Scott who is a former Conservative councillor in the town, and Ben Thomas for the Green Party.

<h2>Great Hollands</h2>

Bracknell Forest council, Berkshire; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Naheed Ejaz.

We finish up for the week in what this column used to describe as England's most right-wing New Town.  Bracknell was the only English New Town which did not elect a Labour MP in the Blair years, and it had been represented by Conservative MPs since at least 1885 and probably earlier than that.  In 2019 the Conservatives won a majority of almost 20,000 votes in the Windsor constituency despite their outgoing MP Phillip Lee falling out with the party over Brexit and ending up in the Lib Dems.  Bracknell Forest council had been under Conservative control continuously since 1997, and Paul Bettison was one of the UK's longest-serving council leaders; the 2019 council elections returned 38 Conservative councillors against 3 Labour and 1 Lib Dem.

And then it all fell apart.  In what turned out to be the first indication of the coming storm, Labour gained a seat in Old Bracknell ward from the Conservatives at a December 2021 by-election, very convincingly.  For the 2023 council elections some manoeuvring between the opposition parties meant that most wards were a straight fight between the Conservatives and one other party, and in most cases the Conservative slate went down to defeat.  This strategy of not contesting every ward meant that Labour polled only 30% of the vote across the borough to the Conservatives' 42%, but Labour won an overall majority on the council with 22 seats against 10 Conservatives, 7 Lib Dems and 2 Greens.

Labour followed up on this by gaining the Bracknell parliamentary seat in 2024 for the very first time, with Peter Swallow defeating the first-term Conservative MP James Sunderland by just 784 votes.  Swallow was an academic before entering the Commons specialising in classics, and he has written two books on the works of the Greek playwright Aristophanes.  No word on whether he can tell undoubted Raphaels from Gerard Dows and Zoffanies.

Great Hollands ward is Bracknell town's south-west corner, and it consists of New Town development from the late 1960s - which had to be be brought forward due to expansion of the Sperry's gyroscope factory, which was at the time Bracknell's largest employer.  As a result, Great Hollands' housing was ready some years before the neighbourhood shopping centre which was intended to serve it.  The New Town genesis can be seen in the fact that Great Hollands South, the main predecessor to this ward, still has substantial levels of social housing.

Boundary changes for the 2023 local elections expanded this ward into Great Hollands North, which was previously the only reliable Labour ward in the district.  The Labour group leader Mary Temperton sought re-election here and she was elected at the top of the Labour slate with a large personal vote.  This boosted the Labour win in the new Great Hollands ward to 74-26 over the Conservatives.  Temperton is now the leader of the council.

This by-election is to replace Labour councillor Naheed Ejaz, who stepped down in September.  Ejaz had first been elected to the council in May 2023, and she immediately became mayor of the borough for 2023-24.

Defending this seat for Labour is Donna Pressland, who works as a carer.  The Conservative candidate Sue Housego is retired.  This time we will not have a straight fight, with former Conservative councillor Michael Gbadebo standing as an independent, Jason Reardon standing for the Heritage Party and Colin Wright for Reform UK.
