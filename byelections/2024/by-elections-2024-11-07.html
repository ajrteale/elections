<h2>Great Hollands</h2>

Bracknell Forest council, Berkshire; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Naheed Ejaz.

We finish up for the week in what this column used to describe as England's most right-wing New Town.  Bracknell was the only English New Town which did not elect a Labour MP in the Blair years, and it had been represented by Conservative MPs since at least 1885 and probably earlier than that.  In 2019 the Conservatives won a majority of almost 20,000 votes in the Windsor constituency despite their outgoing MP Phillip Lee falling out with the party over Brexit and ending up in the Lib Dems.  Bracknell Forest council had been under Conservative control continuously since 1997, and Paul Bettison was one of the UK's longest-serving council leaders; the 2019 council elections returned 38 Conservative councillors against 3 Labour and 1 Lib Dem.

And then it all fell apart.  In what turned out to be the first indication of the coming storm, Labour gained a seat in Old Bracknell ward from the Conservatives at a December 2021 by-election, very convincingly.  For the 2023 council elections some manoeuvring between the opposition parties meant that most wards were a straight fight between the Conservatives and one other party, and in most cases the Conservative slate went down to defeat.  This strategy of not contesting every ward meant that Labour polled only 30% of the vote across the borough to the Conservatives' 42%, but Labour won an overall majority on the council with 22 seats against 10 Conservatives, 7 Lib Dems and 2 Greens.

Labour followed up on this by gaining the Bracknell parliamentary seat in 2024 for the very first time, with Peter Swallow defeating the first-term Conservative MP James Sunderland by just 784 votes.  Swallow was an academic before entering the Commons specialising in classics, and he has written two books on the works of the Greek playwright Aristophanes.  No word on whether he can tell undoubted Raphaels from Gerard Dows and Zoffanies.

Great Hollands ward is Bracknell town's south-west corner, and it consists of New Town development from the late 1960s - which had to be be brought forward due to expansion of the Sperry's gyroscope factory, which was at the time Bracknell's largest employer.  As a result, Great Hollands' housing was ready some years before the neighbourhood shopping centre which was intended to serve it.  The New Town genesis can be seen in the fact that Great Hollands South, the main predecessor to this ward, still has substantial levels of social housing.

Boundary changes for the 2023 local elections expanded this ward into Great Hollands North, which was previously the only reliable Labour ward in the district.  The Labour group leader Mary Temperton sought re-election here and she was elected at the top of the Labour slate with a large personal vote.  This boosted the Labour win in the new Great Hollands ward to 74-26 over the Conservatives.  Temperton is now the leader of the council.

This by-election is to replace Labour councillor Naheed Ejaz, who stepped down in September.  Ejaz had first been elected to the council in May 2023, and she immediately became mayor of the borough for 2023-24.

Defending this seat for Labour is Donna Pressland, who works as a carer.  The Conservative candidate Sue Housego is retired.  This time we will not have a straight fight, with former Conservative councillor Michael Gbadebo standing as an independent, Jason Reardon standing for the Heritage Party and Colin Wright for Reform UK.
