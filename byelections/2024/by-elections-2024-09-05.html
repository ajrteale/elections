Seven by-elections on 5th September 2024:
</p><p>
<h2>Camden Square;<br>
Kentish Town South; and<br>
Kilburn</h2>
</p><p>
Camden council, London; caused respectively by the resignations of Labour councillors Danny Beales, Georgia Gould and Lloyd Hatton.
</p><p>
Today is a bit of a left-wing special on Andrew's Previews, with six of our seven by-elections being caused by newly-elected Labour MPs being elected to Westminster two months ago.  They are all supporters of the Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, and two of them represented wards in Starmer's Holborn and St Pancras constituency.
</p><p>
The name of Holborn and St Pancras recalls local government units which ceased to exist six decades ago, when the Metropolitan Boroughs of Hampstead, Holborn and St Pancras merged into a single local government unit as part of the creation of Greater London.  The new London Borough did not take any of these names: instead it became known by a name which has become associated with this area by a rather curious route.

</p><p>
The story starts back in 1575, when a Londoner called William Camden with a passion for antiquarianism got a job as the Usher of Westminster School.  This was a post which gave him a lot of free time during the school holidays, which Camden used to travel extensively around the British Isles.  The result of this travel was <em>Britannia</em>, which is described on its front page as a <em>chorographica descriptio</em>.  "Chorography" comes from the Greek words for writing about places: the ancient Greek geographer Ptolemy used the word to refer to the study of smaller parts of the word, as opposed to geography as the study of the world as a whole.  Unfortunately, since Camden's day the word "chorography" has fallen out of the English language in favour of "topography" or "cartography", neither of which are really a good description of what William Camden was trying to do.  His aim in writing <em>Britannia</em> was to describe the Britain of his day, county by county, by linking together its landscape, geography, ancient history and modern history.  Andrew's Previews is proud to follow in that tradition.
</p><p>
First published in 1586, <em>Britannia</em> was a huge success and continued to be expanded until its sixth edition in 1607; it was originally written in Latin, and its first English translation in 1610 also contained new material from Camden.  In 1593 Camden moved on from Westminster School, where by this time he was headmaster, to become Clarenceux King of Arms - a post which was intended to give him more free time for research, as at this time the College of Arms was noted for being a centre of antiquarian study.  It was also noted for its unusually vicious internal politics, which Camden navigated successfully.  Camden's <em>Annales</em>, a history of Elizabeth I's reign, dates from this period; his post as Clarenceux King of Arms meant that he attended the queen's funeral in 1603.  William Camden made enough money out of his works to move to a country house in Chislehurst, Kent, in 1609: that was the year he sat for the portrait above by Marcus Gheraerts the Younger.  In 1622, the year before he died, he established a chair at Oxford which is now the Camden Professorship of Ancient History at Brasenose College.

</p><p>
Our story now turns to the eighteenth-century figure of Charles Pratt, who was a confidant of William Pitt the Elder (they had been at Eton together) and had a noted legal and political career: he served in Cabinet for a total of fifteen years under five different Prime Ministers.  Pratt only served as an MP for four years, representing the tiny borough of Downton in Wiltshire from 1757 to 1761.  During that time his legal career blossomed and that gave him the financial security to buy Camden Place - William Camden's old country house in Chislehurst.
</p><p>
In 1761 Pratt swapped the Commons benches for the judicial benches and became Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, receiving first the customary knighthood and then being elevated to the Lords in 1765.  He took the title Lord Camden, after his country seat.  He quickly became what we would now call an activist judge, freeing the radical MP John Wilkes from arrest on the grounds of parliamentary privilege and giving the leading judgment in the 1765 case of <em>Entick v Carrington</em>, which established that the State can only lawfully do what the common law or the statutes allow it to do.
</p><p>
Some time later <em>Entick v Carrington</em> became one of the main inspirations for the Fourth Amendment to the US Constitution, part of the Bill of Rights - which is ironic, given that Lord Camden ended up on the losing side of the American War of Independence.  In 1766 Pitt the Elder appointed him to the Cabinet as Lord Chancellor, in which post Camden served for four years before being forced out in 1770 over his opposition to government policies on America and John Wilkes.  He returned to Cabinet as Lord President of the Council for a short period in 1782-83 and then again in 1784 after Pitt the Younger came to power.  Now promoted to Earl Camden, he remained as Lord President until his death in 1794.
</p><p>
Through his wife, Earl Camden owned some land not far to the north of London.  In 1791 he granted leases for the development of 1,400 homes on this land; thus was born the settlement of Camden Town, which many years later gave its name to the London Borough of Camden.  In the 1820s Camden Road was laid out, running in a straight line north-east from Camden Town to Holloway Road.  Parallel to and to the south of Camden Road can be found a leafy development of high-status detached houses, around the green space of Camden Square.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/camden-camden-sq.png" alt="Camden, Camden Square" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Camden Square has a number of associations with politics, particularly towards the radical and pro-independence end of the political spectrum.  In 1914 the suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst, then a fugitive under the Cat and Mouse Act, addressed her supporters in the square from a balcony.  Number 52 was the home of another suffragist, Annie Swan, who went on to become one of the Liberal Party's first female parliamentary candidates when she contested Glasgow Maryhill in the 1922 general election; Swan subsequently became a founding member of the Scottish National Party.  52 Camden Square is now part of the London Irish Centre and has played host to all sorts of well-known Irish figures from Gerry Adams to Shane MacGowan.
</p><p>
At 57 Camden Square we find a plaque in honour of V K Krishna Menon, the founder of the Penguin imprint Pelican Books, campaigner for Indian independence and, subsequently, the first Indian High Commissioner to the UK; Menon later served in Nehru's cabinet and in both houses of the Indian parliament, but his career in elected office started right here on St Pancras council on which he sat as a Labour councillor from 1934 to 1947.  Finally, at the north end of the square we find 1 South Villas which was home for many years to the West African Students' Union, where figures such as Kwame Nkrumah and Jomo Kenyatta were regular visitors before leading their countries to independence.
</p><p>

</p><p>
Still waiting to become eligible for its blue plaque is 30 Camden Square, the former home of the musician Amy Winehouse, who entered the notorious "27 Club" when she died there in 2011 from an alcohol overdose.  In 2020 Camden council had to put out a notice asking Winehouse fans not to steal the Camden Square roadsigns as memorabilia; at least 14 replacement signs had to be put up between 2011 and 2020, costing council taxpayers Â£290 each to replace.

</p><p>
Camden Square was disturbed in the 1860s by the development of the Midland railway line into St Pancras station, which opened in 1868; the railway runs underneath the Square in a tunnel.  This line's first railway station north of St Pancras is at Kentish Town, whose name has nothing to do with the county of Kent: Kentish Town lies on the lost River Fleet, and the second part of the name is thought to be related to the modern word "ditch" and to refer to that river.  (Those from the Garden of England are traditionally divided by the River Medway into either Kentish Men or Men of Kent; a foolproof way to remember which way round this goes is to note that Kentish Town is on the correct side of the Medway.)  Kentish Town is normally a busy interchange between Thameslink trains and the Northern line of the London Underground: but the Tube station has been closed since 2023 for replacement of its escalators and refurbishment work, which is overrunning its original completion date of the summer just gone.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/camden-kentish-town-s.png" alt="Camden, Kentish Town S" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
The nearby South Kentish Town underground station closed a century ago due to low usage, becoming one of London Underground's "ghost" stations; it is still maintained as an emergency exit from the system.  John Betjeman wrote a short story in the 1950s about a train stopping there after the station's closure and opening its doors in error; a passenger then alighted absent-mindedly, and couldn't find his way out.  If you want to experience that feeling for yourself, you can: the old South Kentish Town station building is now in use as an escape room.
</p><p>
The Camden Square and Kentish Town South electoral wards adjoin each other, with Camden Road being the ward boundary.  These are gentrifying areas of London, and both wards make the top 80 wards in England and Wales for "associate professional and technical occupations".  Kentish Town South is in the top 30 wards for those working in the arts, entertainment or recreation sector and in the top 100 wards for residents born in the EU-14 countries.  Both wards are in the top 100 for households with no access to a car, and both wards have high proportions of social housing.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/camden-kilburn.png" alt="Camden, Kilburn" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
A couple of miles to the west we find the two electoral wards which bear the name "Kilburn", either side of the A5 Watling Street which forms the boundary between Brent and Camden boroughs.  Camden's Kilburn ward is on the east side of that road, and its boundaries include the Overground station at Kilburn High Road on the Euston-Watford line together with the small open space of Kilburn Grange Park.  This ward has had rather more redevelopment of its housing stock over the years, and it makes the top 30 wards in England and Wales for households which are flats or apartments.  Camden's Kilburn ward is part of the Hampstead and Highgate parliamentary seat, represented by the City minister Tulip Siddiq who is having a rather difficult family situation at the moment: Siddiq's aunt, Sheikh Hasina, has recently been overthrown as Prime Minister of Bangladesh.
</p><p>
The modern Camden council has been under Labour control since 1971 with the exception of the 2006-10 term, when the council was hung.  Its central London location means that its list of nationally-notable former councillors is ridiculously long.  A look at the previous election results for Kilburn ward alone brings up no less a figure than Ken Livingstone, who was a councillor here from 1978 to 1982 and chaired Camden's housing committee.  Livingstone stood down after one term (he had become leader of the Greater London Council in 1981), and his seat was taken over by his then partner Kate Allen who later served for 21 years as director of Amnesty International's UK section.  From 2010 to 2022 one of the Labour councillors for Kilburn ward was Maryam Eslamdoust, who became the first native Iranian to serve as a UK mayor when she took over the office of Mayor of Camden for 2019-20 and 2020-21; Eslamdoust, who stood down from the council in 2022, is now the general secretary of the Transport Salaried Staffs' Association.
</p><p>
We can add three more names to that list now, after three Camden Labour councillors were elected to Parliament in July.  Possibly the most prominent of them is Georgia Gould, who had served as leader of the council since 2017 and has recently been appointed OBE for services to local government.  She is the daughter of two peers: the late former Labour campaigning guru Lord Gould of Brookwood, and the chair of Penguin Random House UK Baroness Rebuck.  Georgia Gould had served since 2010 as councillor for Kentish Town ward, transferring to Kentish Town South in 2022 following boundary changes; she is now the MP for Queen's Park and Maida Vale, and she has gone straight into the ranks of government as one of two parliamentary secretaries for the Cabinet Office.
</p><p>
Regular readers of Andrew's Previews will remember Danny Beales from his tilt last last year at the Uxbridge and South Ruislip parliamentary by-election.  Beales lost to the Conservative candidate Steve Tuckwell on that occasion by 495 votes, but this year he won the rematch against Tuckwell by 587 votes to become the first Labour MP for Uxbridge since 1970.  He was first elected to Camden council in 2014 for the former Cantelowes ward (serving alongside the Fawcett Society chair Angela Mason), transferring to Camden Square in the 2022 boundary changes.
</p><p>
But perhaps the most improbable of the new Labour MPs from Camden is Lloyd Hatton, who overturned a Conservative majority of over 18,000 votes to defeat the Tory MP Richard Plunkett-Ernle-Erle-Drax and become the MP for South Dorset.  This is the constituency based on Weymouth, where Hatton was born and grew up.  Gould and Beales are both in their late 30s; Hatton is still in his 20s, and he was in his first term as councillor for Kilburn ward.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2022/camden22.png" alt="Camden, 2022" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
These three by-elections do not remotely affect the Labour majority on Camden council, where the 2022 elections returned 47 Labour councillors against an opposition of 4 Lib Dems, 3 Conservatives and 1 Green.  The new Labour councillor for Hampstead Town ward resigned immediately, having by all accounts never expected to win, and the Lib Dems won the resulting by-election (<em>Andrew's Previews 2022</em>, page 321); we have since had successful by-election defences for Labour (in South Hampstead ward), the Greens (Highgate) and the Conservatives (Frognal): <em>Andrew's Previews 2023</em>, pages 214 and 557.  All three of the wards up for election today were very safely in the Labour column in 2022: Labour polled a massive 76% of the vote in Camden Square, led the Greens 59-22 in Kentish Town South and enjoyed a 67-18 lead over the Conservatives in Kilburn.  Both of Camden's parliamentary seats were also safely Labour in July, with a rather distant second place to Sir Keir Starmer in Holborn and St Pancras going to left-wing pro-Gaza independent Andrew Feinstein.
</p><p>
In Camden Square the defending Labour candidate is Tricia Leman, who is a retired teacher and school governor; she was the losing candidate in the Highgate ward by-election last year, but this should be easier territory for her.  She is up against Alexander Matthews for the Lib Dems, Esmerelda Akpoke for the Conservatives, James Dicker for the Greens, left-wing independent Ali Farah and another independent candidate, Jasper Warwick.
</p><p>
On paper the closest of these wards is Kentish Town South where the defending Labour candidate Joseph Ball is a local businessman, charity trustee, youth sports coach and Yorkshireman.  The Greens have selected Alice Brown, who works as an architect.  Also standing are Tara Copeland for the Lib Dems, Shajib Ziffer for the Conservatives, and secondary school teacher Muhammad Abu Naser as an independent candidate.
</p><p>
Finally we come to Kilburn, where the defending Labour candidate is Revd Robert Thompson who is a Church of England priest currently tending to his flock as vicar of St Mary's Kilburn and St James West Hampstead.  (He is not to be confused with Robert "Mouseman" Thompson, the Kilburn furniture maker who included a carved mouse on every piece he made; "Mouseman" was from Kilburn in North Yorkshire, not this Kilburn.)  Thompson previously served as a Labour councillor in Kensington and Chelsea from 2014 to 2019, when he was working as an assistant curate at St Clements Notting Dale within that borough (<em>Andrew's Previews 2019</em>, page 63); St Clements Notting Dale is close to the ill-fated Grenfell Tower, and Thompson had chaired the Grenfell Recovery Scrutiny Committee which was responsible for holding Kensington and Chelsea council to account over its handling of the fatal 2017 fire.  Revd Thompson's main opposition here may come from the Conservatives' Peter Hornsby, who works as a Parliamentary assistant and has played for the Parliamentary chess team.  The Kilburn ballot paper is completed by David Elkan for the Lib Dems and Michael Gomes Vieira for the Greens.
</p><p>
Counting for all three Camden by-elections will take place on Friday morning.

<h2>Bedlinog and Trelewis</h2>
</p><p>
Merthyr Tydfil council, Glamorgan; caused by the resignation of independent councillor Malcolm Colbran.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/merthyr-tydfil-bedlinog-trelewis.png" alt="Merthyr Tydfil, Bedlinog/Trelewis" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
The odd by-election out this week is in Wales, where we travel to one of the less-visited of the Valleys.  Bedlinog and Trelewis lie in the valley of the Taff Bargoed river, a side valley which joins the Taff at Treharris; Trelewis is divided from Treharris by the river, with Bedlinog a few miles further north up the valley.
</p><p>
Bedlinog and Trelewis' census return shows many of the hallmarks of the Valleys, with the ward being in the top 100 in England and Wales for those of no religion (60.5%) and residents born in the UK (97.9%).  It is the number 7 ward in England and Wales for lower supervisory and technical occupations, a statistic which is often dominated by wards dependent on the mining and quarrying industries.  The villages here were, of course, created by the coal industry; the pits within the ward boundary closed in the 1980s, but the Gelligaer Sandstone Quarry is still open for business.  There is no way beyond Bedlinog by road without ascending into the mountains, but there is a freight-only railway line through the valley serving the massive opencast coal mine at Ffos-y-fran to the east of Merthyr; that mine ceased operations last year, and land remediation work is now underway.  The site of the former Trelewis Drift Mine within the ward has now redeveloped into the Summit UK Centre, which boasts one of the UK's largest indoor climbing walls.
</p><p>
Bedlinog and Trelewis ward was renamed at the boundary review for the 2022 Welsh local elections (it had previously been just "Bedlinog") but was otherwise left intact.  Since 2008 it has returned two independent councillors to Merthyr Tydfil council, which has been run by the council's independent group since 2017.  The 2022 local elections resulted in a 15-15 tie in seats between the independents and Labour, with the independents keeping control only on the chair's casting vote; Labour have since suffered two defection losses, so they are unlikely to be in a position to challenge for the council leadership if they gain this by-election.
</p><p>
The Labour Party do, however, represent this area in Westminster and in the Senedd.  In July Labour MP Gerald Jones was re-elected for a fourth term of office in the redrawn seat of Merthyr Tydfil and Aberdare, with a comfortable lead over second-placed Reform UK; after some years on the shadow frontbench in Labour's opposition years, Jones is now an assistant government whip.  The local MS Dawn Bowden has represented Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney since 2016, and she is in Eluned Morgan's cabinet as minister for social care - a position to which Bowden was originally appointed by the ill-starred Vaughan Gething.
</p><p>
This by-election is to replace independent councillor Malcolm Colbran, who grew up in Sussex and came to Bedlinog in 2003 to run the village's post office.  He has been a Merthyr Tydfil councillor since 2017 and he was mayor of the borough in 2021-22 and 2023-24 - the second year being something of a consolation, after Covid-19 prevented Colbran from fully carrying out his duties first time round.  Colbran was re-elected for a second term in 2022 at the top of the poll in Bedlinog and Trelewis ward, with independents overall polling 58% to Labour's 36%.  He stepped down from the council in July for personal reasons.
</p><p>
Two independent candidates have come forward to succeed Colbran.  Richard Searl, who was an unsuccessful candidate for this ward in 2022, is chair of the local community council and works as a charity fundraising manager; while nursery worker Megan Drozd is involved with the local neighbourhood watch and wants to deliver more for additional learning needs in the area.  The Labour candidate Gill Preston has been involved in community work for over 30 years.  Also standing are the Conservatives' Edward Dawson (who previously stood here in 2022 and was the party's candidate for Blaenau Gwent in the 2021 Senedd election) and this ward's first Plaid Cymru candidate since 2004, Naomi Hughes.

<h2>Crewe West</h2>
</p><p>
Cheshire East council; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Connor Naismith.
</p><p>
We now travel to two Labour defences in north-west England, starting in the town of Crewe.  This is of course a manufacturing town: not just for the railways, without which Crewe would not exist, but also for road transport.  Bentley cars, for instance, have their main factory here.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/ches-e-crewe-w-2024.png" alt="Ches E, Crewe W" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
There are some small railway yards in Crewe West ward, but this is mostly a residential and suburban area.  The ward boundary takes in the main campus of Cheshire College - South and West, the town's main further education college.  Also here is the Victorian splendour of Queens Park, which was opened in 1887 on land donated to Crewe Corporation by the London and North Western Railway.
</p><p>
Crewe is part of the sprawling local government district of Cheshire East, which also takes in Congleton, Macclesfield, Knutsford and Wilmslow and a number of other towns.  It's by far the most left-wing part of the district, and in the 2023 local elections the town's ten councillors split nine to Labour and one to the Conservatives; this is now an 8-2 split following a Conservative by-election gain in Crewe Central ward last February.  Crewe West ward was safely in the Labour column last year, with Labour enjoying a 62-20 lead in 2023 over a localist "Putting Crewe First" slate.
</p><p>
Cheshire East council as a whole has been hung since a rather controversial Conservative administration lost control in 2019.  Since then the show has been run by a coalition of Labour and independent and localist councillors, who are battling particularly acute financial issues partly caused by the last Conservative government's cancellation of Phase 2 of High Speed 2: much of this line would have been routed through Cheshire East, and the council made a lot of investment decisions on the basis that the line would go ahead and then found themselves severely out of pocket.  The latest composition has 28 Labour, 7 independent councillors, 5 Residents of Wilmslow, 2 Tytherington Independents and one councillor from Alderley Edge First forming a total of 43 seats out of 82, plus this vacancy.  In opposition are 33 Conservatives, 2 Lib Dems and three Smiths: John Smith (the sane one in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgGmYeAm0jk"><em>that</em> Handforth Parish Council video</a>) and his wife Julie, who are independent councillors, and Laura Smith who was elected for Labour but is now an "Independent Socialist".
</p><p>
Laura Smith was previously the Labour MP for Crewe and Nantwich from 2017 to 2019, winning the seat with a majority of just 48 votes in 2017 and losing it by 8,508 votes two years later.  Despite this large majority, the Conservatives' Kieran Mullan clearly saw the writing on the wall in advance of the 2024 general election: he applied for the Conservative nomination in the new seat of Chester South and Eddisbury (which had taken in the village of Wybunbury from his constituency) but didn't get it, then announced his retirement, then turned up at the last moment in Sussex as the Conservative candidate for Bexhill and Battle, which he won.
</p><p>
This chicken-running more or less left the field open for Crewe and Nantwich's Labour candidate Connor Naismith, who gained the constituency from the Conservatives in July with a large majority of 9,727 votes.  Naismith has appeared in this column before, because he was first elected to Cheshire East council in a by-election to replace Labour councillor Brian Roberts.  Roberts had passed away in February 2020, and a by-election in Crewe West ward to replace him was scheduled for 23rd April 2020 but ended up being cancelled because of the pandemic; as a result, the seat was vacant for more than a year before Naismith was eventually elected in May 2021 (<em>Andrew's Previews 2021</em>, page 83).
</p><p>
There are no scheduled elections now in Cheshire East until May 2027, so Naismith had the choice of seeing out the last three years of his council term or provoking a by-election sooner or later.  He has chosen to go now, so we have another Crewe West by-election for Labour to defend.  Their candidate is Ben Wye, who already represents this ward on Crewe town council.  Putting Crewe First are standing their leader Brian Silvester, who has been around in Crewe politics for a long time and has stood under a large number of political labels: he finished in third place here at the 2021 Crewe West by-election, and he finished fifth and came nowhere near saving his deposit as the Putting Crewe First candidate in the general election two months ago.  Also standing are David Simcox for the Conservatives, Melanie English for the Greens and Nick Goulding for Reform UK.

<h2>Baguley</h2>
</p><p>
Manchester council; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Phil Brickell.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/manchester-baguley.png" alt="Manchester, Baguley" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
We stay with territory which is historically Cheshire, as we have come to the part of the city of Manchester which lies south of the River Mersey.  In other words, we're in Wythenshawe, that Manchester suburb which was developed by the city council as an effective municipal New Town.  Baguley (stress the first syllable only) is very much in this vein, with nearly half of its households still being social housing and with large sources of employment within the ward.  Here can be found part of the massive Roundthorn industrial estate together with Wythenshawe Hospital, a teaching hospital affiliated with the University of Manchester which is a national centre for respiratory medicine and cardiothoracic surgery.  The Metrolink tram stops at Baguley, Roundthorn and Martinscroft, on the Airport branch, link the ward to Manchester city centre.
</p><p>
Wythenshawe has been a politically left-wing area since it was developed: the fact that the old Manchester Wythenshawe constituency had a Conservative MP until 1964 is largely explained by the fact that that seat then included Didsbury.  The modern Wythenshawe and Sale East constituency is entirely south of the Mersey, and it has been a safe seat for Labour MP Mike Kane since he won a by-election in February 2014.  Kane has joined the government frontbench, as a junior minister in the Department for Transport with responsibility for maritime, aviation and security.
</p><p>
Before he became an MP Kane had been a Manchester city councillor.  The latest MP to follow that path is Phil Brickell, an Old Boltonian who was elected to Parliament in July as the MP for Bolton West.  Getting a majority of almost 5,000 votes over the previous Tory MP Chris Green, in a seat which Green had built up over his nine years in office to become the safest Conservative seat in Greater Manchester, is no mean feat.  Brickell had previously worked in the financial services industry, and he was in his first term as a Manchester city councillor having been elected in 2023.
</p><p>
Baguley is a far safer Labour area than Bolton West.  There has been no serious challenge to Labour in this ward for many years, and in May's city council elections Labour enjoyed a 64-17 lead over the Conservatives.  The latest city council composition has 86 Labour councillors plus this vacancy, against 4 Lib Dems, 3 Greens (who represent the airport-influenced Woodhouse Park ward in southern Wythenshawe, not the trendy/student areas), 1 independent and 1 councillor who has defected to the Workers Party of Britain.
</p><p>
Defending for Labour is Munaver Rasul, a chartered accountant who has previous local government experience, albeit some time ago: he sat on Trafford council from 1999 to 2004, representing Sale Moor ward.  The Conservative candidate Stephen Carlton-Woods is a broadcaster who presents shows on local radio stations in Wythenshawe and Altrincham and also does political commentary for GB News.  Also standing are Thirza Asanga-Rae for the Green Party, Euan Stewart for the Lib Dems and Sebastian Moore for the Social Democratic Party.

<h2>Longbeck</h2>
</p><p>
Redcar and Cleveland council, North Yorkshire; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Luke Myer.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/redcar-cleveland-longbeck-2024.png" alt="Redcar/Cleveland, Longbeck" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
For our final by-election of the week we travel to the coast of what was once the North Riding of Yorkshire.  Longbeck ward is just to the south-east of Redcar, off the edge of the Teesside conurbation: it's based on the western end of Marske-by-the-Sea together with the village of New Marske to the south.  At the centre of the ward is Longbeck railway station, opened in the 1980s by British Rail to serve the ward; it's on the Saltburn branch line, with regular trains to Middlesbrough.
</p><p>
New Marske was a mining settlement in the Cleveland Hills, which used to contain large amounts of the ironstone which turned Middlesbrough into such a successful ironworking centre.  Ironstone mining in Cleveland ended long ago, and Longbeck ward's economy was traditionally underpinned in recent years by commuting to the Teesside conurbation and particularly the Redcar steelworks: in the 2011 census Longbeck was in the top 20 wards in England and Wales for Apprenticeship qualifications and in the top 50 wards for the census "lower supervisory, technical" employment group.
</p><p>
When this column last looked at Longbeck ward in detail in March 2018 (<em>Andrew's Previews 2018</em>, page 110), I speculated that the closure of the Redcar steelworks might have an effect on those stats.  Well, I was wrong on that: in the 2021 census return Longbeck ward came in at number 21 for Apprenticeship qualifications and was still in the top 50 for lower supervisory and technical occupations.  The clue here is (for those who remember what I said in the Bedlinog and Trelewis section above) that Longbeck also came in the top 10 wards for those working in the mining and quarrying sector.  This is related to the Boulby mine in Loftus, not too far away on the far side of Saltburn, which once produced half of the UK's supply of potash and now mines polyhalite - both of those minerals are in demand as agricultural fertiliser.  The Boulby mine is so far underground that it is of interest to cosmologists, and the mine houses a number of scientific instruments looking for so-called dark matter - because only very weakly interacting subatomic particles can penetrate into the Earth this far.
</p><p>
In March 2018 I also wrote "Longbeck ward's previous election results are unusually complicated, so please bear with me."  Things have got even more complicated since.  You have been warned.
</p><p>
In 2003 Longbeck ward elected two Conservatives, Norah Cooney and Vera Moody, together with independent councillor Mike Findley.  In 2005 Findley was diagnosed with motor neurone disease and was told that he had between two and five years to live, but this didn't stop him: by the time he eventually passed away in 2019 he had raised around Â£200,000 for research into the disease and he had been appointed MBE.
</p><p>
Findley, Cooney and Moody were re-elected in 2007 from a long ballot paper which featured two different candidates both called Norman Brown - one independent, one Lib Dem.  In 2011 Findley retired and Moody lost her seat: the new councillors were Lib Dem Victoria Reyer and Labour candidate Vic Jeffries, producing a rare three-way split between the three main parties.  The good Lib Dem performance reflected the party's unexpected gain of the Redcar parliamentary seat the previous year.
</p><p>
Both Reyer and Jeffries sought re-election in 2015 as independent candidates for Longbeck ward.  Reyer had left the Lib Dem group in 2013, while the Labour group in Redcar and Cleveland had split down the middle shortly before the 2015 election with Jeffries on the dissident side.  Perhaps in an ironic reflection of that split, the official Labour slate here in the 2015 election was headed by Sheila Argument.  None of those candidates won; Conservative Norah Cooney was re-elected at the top of the poll, Mike Findley successfully returned in second place and the third seat went to UKIP candidate Steve Turner, who beat Argument by 80 votes to become the only UKIP member of Redcar and Cleveland council.  Vic Jeffries finished in seventh place behind the Labour slate and lost his seat; despite this, he continued to attend council meetings and functions by acting as a carer for Mike Findley.  Findley eventually retired from the council for the second time in 2018, the year before he died, and the resulting by-election was gained by the Conservatives' Vera Rider on a low share of the vote.  By this time Steve Turner had defected from UKIP to the Conservatives, giving the Tories all three seats in Longbeck ward.
</p><p>
This changed in May 2019 when a boundary review cut Longbeck ward from three seats to two: the previous ward boundaries contained some new development which was clearly part of Redcar but had overspilled into Saltburn, Marske and New Marske parish, and this area was transferred into a new Wheatlands ward of Redcar.  Steve Turner lives in that transferred area and he decided to seek re-election in Wheatlands, but he lost to the Lib Dems.  Vera Rider and Norah Cooney were re-elected as the two Conservative councillors for Longbeck, with Cooney winning the second seat just six votes ahead of Victor Jeffries.  When the Redcar parliamentary seat was gained by the Conservatives in the December 2019 general election, Cooney and Rider were the only two Conservative councillors in the constituency.
</p><p>
Norah Cooney died in April 2020 at the age of 89, and pandemic restrictions meant that her seat was vacant for more than a year.  The resulting by-election was finally held in May 2021, a day when the Conservatives won every seat in the former Cleveland county that they contested (<em>Andrew's Previews 2021</em>, page 168).  Steve Turner's wife Andrea won the 2021 Longbeck by-election with 45% of the vote, with 26-year-old Labour candidate Luke Myer coming in second on 28% and Mike Findley's widow Judith placing third with 25% as an independent.  Myer did get the consolation prize of a place on Saltburn, Marske and New Marske parish council.  Former ward councillor Steve Turner was elected on the same day as Cleveland Police and Crime Commissioner, gaining that position from Labour.  This did not give the Conservatives a monopoly of Longbeck ward's representation, because by this point the party group on Redcar and Cleveland council had suffered a serious split and Vera Rider had become an independent councillor.
</p><p>
In the May 2023 local elections Longbeck ward came to national attention as the very last ward to declare its result: multiple recounts were not finally settled until the Tuesday after the election, the day after the winning councillors should have taken up their office.  The recounts were not about the position of the winning Labour candidate Luke Myer, who polled 707 votes and finished well clear of the field.  Rather, they were about who would win the second seat; in the final result that went to Vera Rider, now standing as an independent, who polled 413 votes to 409 for the leader of the council's Conservative group Andrea Turner.  Independent Vic Jeffries finished in fourth place, while the other Conservative candidate - Cleveland Police and Crime Commissioner Steve Turner - placed a humiliating fifth.  The vote share percentages, for what they are worth, came out as 46% for Labour and 27% each for independents and the Conservatives.
</p><p>
Not all Redcar and Cleveland wards turn in election results as volatile as those of Longbeck, but the council as a whole has been hung since 2013 and has alternated between Labour-led and independent-led administrations at the three council elections since then.  The current council is rather balanced, with 22 Labour councillors plus this vacancy facing 13 Conservatives, 13 independents and 10 Lib Dems.  Labour run a minority administration, and until his election to Parliament in July Luke Myer was part of the council's cabinet with the children's services portfolio.
</p><p>
The Conservative total above now includes Vera Rider, who rejoined the party last year in a move which, it's fair to say, has not been universally popular.  Steve Turner was reported as calling the decision to readmit Rider to the party as "appalling and spectacularly naÃ¯ve", and this opinion would appear to have been borne out by subsequent chaotic events on Saltburn, Marske and New Marske parish council where Rider was then the chair.  A row over the felling of a sycamore tree led to meetings being abandoned in Handforthesque scenes, and a non-binding parish poll in May expressed no-confidence in Rider by a margin of 324 votes to 76.
</p><p>
Longbeck ward has already gone to the polls twice this year: in May for the Tees Valley mayoral election and for the Cleveland PCC election (in which Steve Turner was defeated), and in July for the general election. Longbeck is part of the Redcar parliamentary seat which was a Labour gain this year for MP Anna Turley: she returns to the Commons after previously representing the town from 2015 to 2019, and she has gone straight into the Government Whips office on her return to Westminster.  Councillor Luke Myer, meanwhile, got the Labour nomination for the neighbouring seat of Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland, which is a traditional marginal although slightly more Labour-inclined than the country as a whole (it voted Labour in 2010 and 2015); he went on to defeat Sir Simon Clarke, who briefly served in the Liz Truss Cabinet as L******** U*, Housing and Communities secretary, by the narrow margin of 214 votes.  Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland was one of the relatively few constituencies which did not have a Reform UK candidate in July; Reform instead endorsed the journalist Rod Liddle, who stood as the SDP candidate and narrowly failed to save his deposit.
</p><p>
Luke Myer MP was in the same position as Connor Naismith in Crewe: with no more scheduled elections due in Redcar and Cleveland until his term was due to end in 2027, he would have to provoke a standalone by-election if he wanted to resign his council seat before then.  So, here we are.
</p><p>
Defending the 2024 Longbeck by-election for Labour is Jane Bradley, who works as a teacher.  The ballot paper for this by-election suggests that the chaos will continue at least for the time being because there are three independent candidates: former Conservative ward councillor Andrea Turner, who would appear to have fallen out with the party; regular independent candidate and ex-Labour ward councillor Vic Jeffries; and Steve Cooper, who stood here in 2019 as a UKIP candidate.  The official Conservative candidate Stephen Crane, a businessman from New Marske, stood here in 2023 as an independent candidate and finished in sixth and last place.  Also standing are Sarah Booth for the Lib Dems and Christopher Gallacher, a former UKIP member of Redcar and Cleveland council (and council cabinet member in a former independent and Lib Dem administration) who lost his seat in Normanby ward as an independent candidate in 2023, and now has the Reform UK nomination.
</p><p>
Confused?  You will be.  Maybe next week's column will be more straightforward; it will certainly be long, because with ten by-elections taking place on 12th September we will have our first Super Thursday of the new Parliament.  Stay tuned for that.
