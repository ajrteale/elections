Seven by-elections on 5th September 2024:

<h2>Camden Square;<br>
Kentish Town South; and<br>
Kilburn</h2>

Camden council, London; caused respectively by the resignations of Labour councillors Danny Beales, Georgia Gould and Lloyd Hatton.

Today is a bit of a left-wing special on Andrew's Previews, with six of our seven by-elections being caused by newly-elected Labour MPs being elected to Westminster two months ago.  They are all supporters of the Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, and two of them represent wards in Starmer's Holborn and St Pancras constituency.

The name of Holborn and St Pancras recalls local government units which ceased to exist six decades ago, when the Metropolitan Boroughs of Hampstead, Holborn and St Pancras merged into a single local government unit as part of the creation of Greater London.  The new London Borough did not take any of these names: instead it became known by a name which has become associated with this area by a rather curious route.

The story starts back in 1575, when a Londoner called William Camden got a job as the Usher of Westminster School - a post which gave him a lot of free time during the school holidays, which Camden used to travel extensively around the British Isles.  The result of this travel was <em>Britannia</em>, which is described on its front page as a <em>chorographica descriptio</em>.  "Chorography" comes from the Greek words for writing about places: the ancient Greek geographer Ptolemy used the word to refer to the study of smaller parts of the word, as opposed to geography as the study of the world as a whole.  Camden's aim in writing <em>Britannia</em> was to describe the Britain of his day, county by county, by linking together its landscape, geography, ancient history and modern history.  Andrew's Previews is proud to follow in that tradition.  Since Camden's day the word "chorography" has fallen out of the English language in favour of "topography" or "cartography", neither of which are really a good description of what William Camden was trying to do - to paint a local or regional picture with words rather than maps.

First published in 1586, <em>Britannia</em> was a huge success and continued to be expanded until its sixth edition in 1607; it was originally written in Latin, and its first English translation in 1610 also contained new material from Camden.  In 1593 Camden moved on from Westminster School, where by this time he was headmaster, to become Clarenceux King of Arms - a post which was intended to give him more free time for research, as at this time the College of Arms was noted both for being a centre of antiquarian study and for its unusually vicious internal politics, which Camden navigated successfully.  Camden's <em>Annales</em>, a history of Elizabeth I's reign, dates from this period; his post as Clarenceux King of Arms meant that he attended the queen's funeral.  William Camden made enough money out of his works to move to a country house in Chislehurst in 1609, and in 1622 - the year before he died - he established a chair at Oxford which is now the Camden Professorship of Ancient History at Brasenose College.

Our story now turns to the eighteenth-century figure of Charles Pratt, who was a confidant of William Pitt the Elder (they had been at Eton together) and had a noted legal and political career - he served in Cabinet for a total of fifteen years under five different Prime Ministers.  Pratt served as an MP for the tiny borough of Downton in Wiltshire from 1757 to 1761, during which time his legal career blossomed and gave him the financial security to buy Camden Place - William Camden's old country house in Chislehurst.  In 1761 Pratt left the Commons to become Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, receiving first the customary knighthood and then being elevated to the Lords in 1765: he took the title Lord Camden, after his country seat.  He quickly became what we would now call an activist judge, freeing the radical MP John Wilkes from arrest on the grounds of parliamentary privilege and giving the leading judgment in the 1765 case of <em>Entick v Carrington</em>, which established that the State can only lawfully do what the common law or the statutes allow it to do.

Some time later <em>Entick v Carrington</em> became one of the main inspirations for the Fourth Amendment to the US Constitution, part of the Bill of Rights - which is ironic, given that Camden ended up on the losing side of the War of Independence.  In 1766 Pitt the Elder appointed him to the Cabinet as Lord Chancellor, in which post Lord Camden served for four years before being forced out in 1770 over his opposition to government policies on America and John Wilkes.  He returned to Cabinet as Lord President of the Council for a short period in 1782-83 and then again in 1784 after Pitt the Younger came to power.  Now promoted to Earl Camden, he remained as Lord President until his death in 1794.

Through his wife, Earl Camden owned some land not far to the north of London.  In 1791 he granted leases for the development of 1,400 homes on this land; thus was born the settlement of Camden Town, which many years later gave its name to the London Borough of Camden.  In the 1820s Camden Road was laid out, running in a straight line north-east from Camden Town to Holloway Road.  At the time this area was still open countryside, but in the 1860s a leafy town square had been laid out parallel to and to the south of Camden Road.

Camden Square has a number of associations with artists.  The wood engraver Orlando Jewitt died here in 1869; Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema briefly lived here in the 1870s; the twentieth-century sculptor William Turnbull had a home on the square; and house number 30 may well gain a blue plaque at some point as the former home of the musician Amy Winehouse, who entered the notorious "27 Club" when she died there in 2011 from an alcohol overdose.  In 2020 Camden council put out a notice asking Winehouse fans not to steal the Camden Square roadsigns as memorabilia; at least 14 replacement signs had to be put up between 2011 and 2020, costing the council Â£290 each to replace.

One of the spurs for building Camden Square may well have been the development of the Midland railway line into St Pancras station, which opened in 1868; the railway runs underneath Camden Square in a tunnel.  The first railway station north of St Pancras is at Kentish Town, whose name has nothing to do with the county of Kent: Kentish Town lies on the lost River Fleet, and the second part of the name is thought to be related to the modern word "ditch" and to refer to that river.  Kentish Town is normally a busy interchange between Thameslink trains and the Northern line of the London Underground: but the Underground station has been closed since 2023 for replacement of the escalators and refurbishment work.

The nearby South Kentish Town underground station closed a century ago due to low usage, becoming one of London Underground's "ghost" stations; it is still maintained as an emergency exit from the system.  John Betjeman wrote a short story in the 1950s about a train stopping there after the closure and opening its doors in error; a passenger then alighted, and couldn't find his way out.  If you want to experience that for yourself, you can: the old South Kentish Town station building is now in use as an escape room.

The Camden Square and Kentish Town South electoral wards adjoin each other, with Camden Road being the ward boundary.  These are gentrifying areas of London, and both wards make the top 80 wards in England and Wales for "associate professional and technical occupations".  Kentish Town South is in the top 30 wards for those working in the arts, entertainment or recreation sector and in the top 100 wards for residents born in the EU-14 countries.  Both wards are in the top 100 for households with no access to a car, and both wards have high proportions of social housing.

A couple of miles to the west we find the two electoral wards which bear the name "Kilburn", either side of the A5 Watling Street which forms the boundary between Brent and Camden boroughs.  Camden's Kilburn ward is on the east side of that road, and its boundaries include the Overground station at Kilburn High Road on the Euston-Watford line together with the small open space of Kilburn Grange Park.  This ward has had rather more redevelopment of its housing stock over the years, and it makes the top 30 wards in England and Wales for households which are flats or apartments.  Camden's Kilburn ward is part of the Hampstead and Highgate parliamentary seat, represented by the City minister Tulip Siddiq who is having a rather difficult family situation at the moment: Siddiq's aunt, Sheikh Hasina, has recently been overthrown as Prime Minister of Bangladesh.

The modern Camden council has been under Labour control since 1971 with the exception of the 2006-10 term, when the council was hung.  Its central London location means that its list of nationally-notable former councillors is ridiculously long.  A look at the previous election results for Kilburn ward alone brings up no less a figure than Ken Livingstone, who was a councillor here from 1978 to 1982 and chaired Camden's housing committee.  Livingstone stood down after one term (he had become leader of the Greater London Council in 1981), and his seat was taken over by his then partner Kate Allen who later served for 21 years as director of Amnesty International's UK section.  From 2010 to 2022 one of the Labour councillors for Kilburn ward was Maryam Eslamdoust, who became the first native Iranian to serve as a UK mayor when she took over the office of Mayor of Camden for 2019-20 and 2020-21; Eslamdoust, who stood down from the council in 2022, is now the general secretary of the Transport Salaried Staffs' Association.

We can add three more names to that list now, after three Camden Labour councillors were elected to Parliament in July.  Possibly the most prominent of them is Georgia Gould, who had served as leader of the council since 2017 and has recently been appointed OBE for services to local government.  She is the daughter of two peers: the former Labour campaigning guru Lord Gould of Brookwood, and the chair of Penguin Random House UK Baroness Rebuck.  Georgia Gould had served since 2010 as councillor for Kentish Town ward, transferring to Kentish Town South in 2022 following boundary changes; she is now the MP for Queen's Park and Maida Vale, and she has gone straight into the ranks of government as one of two parliamentary secretaries for the Cabinet Office.  Regular readers of Andrew's Previews will remember Danny Beales from his tilt last last year at the Uxbridge and South Ruislip parliamentary by-election: Beales lost to the Conservative candidate Steve Tuckwell on that occasion by 495 votes, but this year he won the rematch against Tuckwell by 587 votes to become the first Labour MP for Uxbridge since 1970.  He was first elected to Camden council in 2014 for the former Cantelowes ward (serving alongside the Fawcett Society chair Angela Mason), transferring to Camden Square in the 2022 boundary changes.   But perhaps the most improbable of the new Labour MPs from Camden is Lloyd Hatton, who overturned a Conservative majority of over 18,000 votes to defeat the Tory MP Richard Plunkett-Ernle-Erle-Drax and become the MP for South Dorset; this is the constituency based on Weymouth, where Hatton was born and grew up.  Gould and Beales are both in their late 30s; Hatton is still in his 20s, and he was in his first term as councillor for Kilburn ward.

These three by-elections do not remotely affect the Labour majority on Camden council, where the 2022 elections returned 47 Labour councillors against an opposition of 4 Lib Dems, 3 Conservatives and 1 Green.  The new Labour councillor for Hampstead Town ward resigned immediately, having by all accounts never expected to win, and the Lib Dems won the resulting by-election; we have since had successful by-election defences for Labour (in South Hampstead ward), the Greens (Highgate) and the Conservatives (Frognal).  All three of the wards up for election today were very safely in the Labour column in 2022: Labour polled a massive 76% of the vote in Camden Square, led the Greens 59-22 in Kentish Town South and enjoyed a 67-18 lead over the Conservatives in Kilburn.  Both of Camden's parliamentary seats were also safely Labour in July, with a rather distant second place to Sir Keir Starmer in Holborn and St Pancras going to left-wing pro-Gaza independent Andrew Feinstein.

In Camden Square the defending Labour candidate is Tricia Leman, who is a retired teacher and school governor; she was the losing candidate in the Highgate ward by-election last year, but this should be easier territory for her.  She is up against Alexander Matthews for the Lib Dems, Esmerelda Akpoke for the Conservatives, James Dicker for the Greens, left-wing independent Ali Farah and another independent candidate, Jasper Warwick.

On paper the closest of these wards is Kentish Town South where the defending Labour candidate Joseph Ball is a local businessman, charity trustee, youth sports coach and Yorkshireman.  The Greens have selected Alice Brown, who works as an architect.  Also standing are Tara Copeland for the Lib Dems, Shajib Ziffer for the Cosnervatives, and secondary school taecher Muhammad Abu Naser as an independent candidate.

Finally we come to Kilburn, where the defending Labour candidate is Revd Robert Thompson who has appeared in this column before: he is a Church of England priest currently tending to his flock as vicar of St Mary's Kilburn and St James West Hampstead, and he served as a Labour councillor in Kensington and Chelsea from 2014 to 2019 when he was working at a parish within that borough.  (He is not to be confused with Robert "Mouseman" Thompson, the Kilburn furniture maker who included a carved mouse on every piece he made; "Mouseman" was from Kilburn in North Yorkshire, not this Kilburn.)  The Conservatives have selected Peter Hornsby, who works as a Parliamentary assistant and has played for the Parliamentary chess team.  The Kilburn ballot paper is completed by David Elkan for the Lib Dems and Michael Gomes Vieira for the Greens.

<h2>Bedlinog and Trelewis</h2>

Merthyr Tydfil council, Glamorgan; caused by the resignation of independent councillor Malcolm Colbran.

The odd by-election out this week is in Wales, where we travel to one of the less-visited of the Valleys.  Bedlinog and Trelewis lie in the valley of the Taff Bargoed, a side valley which joins the Taff at Trehearris; Trelewis is divided from Treharris by the river, with Bedlinog a few miles further north up the valley.

Bedlinog and Trelewis' census return shows many of the hallmarks of the Valleys, with the ward being in the top 100 in England and Wales for those of no religion (60.5%) and residents born in the UK (97.9%).  It is the number 7 ward in England and Wales for lower supervisory and technical occupations, a statistic which is often dominated by wards dependent on the mining and quarrying industries.  The villages here were, of course, created by the coal industry; the pits within the ward boundary closed in the 1980s, but the Gelligaer Sandstone Quarry is still open for business.  There is no way beyond Bedlinog by road without ascending into the mountains, but there is a freight-only railway line through the valley serving the massive opencast coal mine at Ffos-y-fran to the east of Merthyr; that mine ceased operations last year, and land remediation work is now underway.  The site of the former Trelewis Drift Mine within the ward has now redeveloped into the Summit Centre, which boasts one of the UK's largest indoor climbing walls.

Bedlinog and Trelewis ward was renamed at the boundary review for the 2022 Welsh local elections (it had previously been just "Bedlinog") but was otherwise left intact.  Since 2008 it has returned two independent councillors to Merthyr Tydfil council, which has been run by the council's independent group since 2017.  The 2022 local elections resulted in a 15-15 tie between the independents and Labour, with the independents keeping control only on the chair's casting vote; Labour have since suffered two defection losses, so they are unlikely to be in a position to challenge for the council leadership if they gain this by-election.

The Labour Party do, however, represent this area in Westminster and in the Senedd.  In July Labour MP Gerald Jones was re-elected for a fourth term of office in the redrewn seat of Merthyr Tydfil and Aberdare, with a comfortable lead over second-placed Reform UK; after some years on the shadow frontbench in Labour's opposition years, Jones is now an assistant government whip.  The local MS Dawn Bowden has represented Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney since 2016, and she is in Eluned Morgan's cabinet as minister for social care - a position to which Bowden was originally appointed by the ill-fated Vaughan Gething.

This by-election is to replace independent coucnillor Malcolm Colbran, who grew up in Sussex and came to Bedlinog in 2003 to run the village's post office.  He has been a Merthyr Tydfil councillor since 2017 and he was mayor of the borough in 2021-22 and 2023-24 - the second year being something of a consolation, after Covid-19 prevented Colbran from fully carrying out his duties during his first mayoral year.  Colbran was re-elected for a second term in 2022 at the top of the poll in Bedlinog and Trelewis ward, with independents overall polling 58% to Labour's 36%.  He stepped down from the council in July for personal reasons.

Two independent candidates have come forward to succeed Colbran.  Richard Searl, who was an unsuccessful candidate for this ward in 2022, is chair of the local community council and works as a charity fundraising manager; while nursery worker Megan Drozd is involved with the local neighbourhood watch and wants to deliver more for additional learning needs in the area.  The Labour candidate Gill Preston has been involved in community work for over 30 years.  Also standing are the Conservatives' Edward Dawson (who previously stood here in 2022 and was the party's candidate for Blaenau Gwent in the 2021 Senedd election) and this ward's first Plaid Cymru candidate since 2004, Naomi Hughes.

<h2>Baguley</h2>

Manchester council; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Phil Brickell.

We stay with territory which is historically Cheshire, as we have come to the part of the city of Manchester which lies south of the River Mersey.  In other words, we're in Wythenshawe, that Manchester suburb which was developed by the city council as an effective municipal New Town.  Baguley (stress the first syllable only) is very much in this vein, with nearly half of its households still being social housing and and large sources of employment within the ward.  Here can be found part of the massive Roundthorn industrial estate together with Wythenshawe Hospital, a teaching hospital affiliated with the University of Manchester which is a national centre for respiratory medicine and cardiothoracic surgery.  The Metrolink tram stops at Baguley, Roundthorn and Martinscroft, on the Airport branch, link the ward to Manchester city centre.

Wythenshawe has been a poltiically left-wing area since it was developed: the fact that the old Manchester Wythenshawe constituency had a Conservative MP until 1964 is largely explained by the fact that that seat then included Didsbury.  The modern Wythenshawe and Sale East constituency is entirely south of the Mersey, and it has been a safe seat for Labour MP Mike Kane since he won a by-election in February 2014.  Kane has goined the government frontbench, as a junior minister in the Department for Transport with responsibility for maritime, aviation and security.

Before he became an MP Kane had been a Manchester city councillor as had Phil Brickell, an Old Boltonian who was elected to Parliament in July as the MP for Bolton West.  Getting a majority of almost 5,000 votes over the previous Tory MP Chris Green, in a seat which Green had built up over his nine years in office to become the safest Conservative seat in Greater Manchester, is no mean feat.  Brickell had previously worked in the financial services industry, and he was in his first term as a Manchester city councillor having been elected in 2023.

Baguley is a far safer Labour area than Bolton West.  There has been no serious challenge to Labour in this ward for many years, and in May's city council elections Labour enjoyed a 64-17 lead over the Conservatives.  The latest city council composition has 86 Labour councillors plus this vacancy, against 4 Lib Dems, 3 Greens (who represent Woodhouse Park ward in Wythenshawe, not the trendy student areas), 1 independent and 1 councillor who has defected to the Workers Party of Britain.

Defending for Labour is Munaver Rasul, a chartered accountant who has previous local government experience, albeit some time ago: he sat on Trafford council from 1999 to 2004, representing Sale Moor ward.  The Conservative candidate Stephen Carlton-Woods is a broadcaster who works for local radio stations in Wythenshawe and Altrincham and also does political commentary for GB News.  Also standing are Thirza Asanga-Rae for the Green Party, Euan Stewart for the Lib Dems and Sebastian Moore for the Social Democratic Party.
