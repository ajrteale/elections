One by-election on 23rd May 2024:
</p><p>
<h2>Wymondham</h2>
</p><p>
Melton council, Leicestershire; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Malise Graham.
</p><p>
If you want to make Stilton cheese, you've got to be careful where you make it.  Under Protected Designation of Origin rules, Stilton cheese can only be made in the counties of Derbyshire, Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire.  It can't be made in Stilton itself, a village on the Great North Road in Cambridgeshire where the cheese was traditionally sold.
</p><p>
Legend has it that the birthplace of Stilton cheese was the small Leicestershire village of Wymondham (pronounced as it is spelled, rather than as the Norfolk town of the same name is pronounced).  The creation of the modern Stilton cheese is generally credited to local cheesemaker Francis Pawlett in the 1720s.  The story then goes that the landlord of Stilton's Bell Inn visited a small farm near Melton Mowbray in 1730, possibly Pawlett's farm, and he liked the cheese so much that the Bell Inn was granted exclusive marketing rights to Blue Stilton.

Melton council is England's smallest second-tier district by population, and the Leicestershire Wymondham, located about 15 miles to the south of Grantham and close to the Lincolnshire and Rutland boundary, is still - as it was 300 years ago - a very small place which is well off the beaten track.  Probably the biggest thing to happen here in recent years was when the England footballer Michael Carrick, then playing for Manchester United and now head coach of Middlesbrough, got married in Wymondham's parish church in the summer of 2007.  Wymondham parish has a population comfortably under 700, but it's still the largest of the four-and-a-bit rural parishes which make up its ward; the electoral ward runs along the B-road east from Melton Mowbray as far as Buckminster.  Buckminster itself is an estate village, which expanded in the nineteenth century to serve an aristocratic estate which is still in the hands of the Tollemache family.  The present Buckminster Park house was built in the 1960s, after the previous stately home of Buckminster Hall burned down in 1951.
</p><p>
This by-election is to replace a very long-serving and high-profile councillor.  Malise Graham has represented this area on Melton council continuously since May 1987, and he has held all the local civic offices.  Graham was leader of the council on three occasions, most recently in 2001-11, led the borough's Conservative group for a total of 18 years, and served three years as mayor of Melton (1993-94 and 2019-21).  His leadership saw the council recover from a fire in 2008 which burned down the council offices, while during Graham's mayoral term he did a tandem parachute jump to raise money for a local hospice.  In the 2009 New Year honours list Graham was appointed MBE for voluntary service to the community in Melton Mowbray.  He is now 75 years old, and he is retiring after 37 years as a Melton councillor.
</p><p>
Elections in this area are like Stilton cheese: rather blue.  Malise Graham had a very safe Melton council ward in which he was often elected unopposed.  He did face a contest when seeking his tenth and most recent term of office in May 2023, defeating Labour by 72-28 in what was generally a poor Conservative year.  The Wymondham ward is split between two divisions of Leicestershire county council, Belvoir and Melton Wolds, which are both very safely Conservative.  The local parliamentary seat of Rutland and Melton is being split into two new seats by the boundary changes, with Melton district being placed within the completely new Parliamentary constituency of Melton and Syston; this is projected to have been safely Conservative in December 2019, and junior Home Office minister Edward Argar - who is coming off three terms as MP for Charnwood - will be the Conservative candidate here very soon.
</p><p>
Those looking to this by-election for clues as to how Melton and Syston might vote are likely to be disappointed, because this by-election is a straight fight between the Conservatives and an independent candidate.  Defending from the blue corner is David Chubb, who is the churchwarden at St Andrew's in Coston, a village within the ward.  The independent challenge comes from Samantha Seaward.
