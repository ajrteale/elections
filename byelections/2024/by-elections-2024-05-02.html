<!-- 2nd May 2024 -->
Welcome to the annual Andrew's Previews megapreview, covering everything that goes on in the ordinary local elections in England and Wales on 2nd May 2024.  This year marks the 50th anniversary of most of the councils up for election in England this year, which first took up their responsibilities on 1st April 1974 after having initial elections in the spring of 1973.  It remains to be seen whether the whole shebang can last another 50 years.
</p><p>
Because of its size, this Preview has been split into four parts.  Part I will cover the introduction, Wales and London.  Part II will cover the English North and Midlands, with the exception of the Lancashire police area.  Part III will cover the South of England outside London.  Finally, Part IV will be the Parliamentary Special for Blackpool South, other elections in Lancashire, and concluding remarks including the annual <em>In memoriam</em> section where we pay tribute to councillors who have passed away over the last year.
</p><p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
</p><p>
In seat terms, this is the quietest local election year since 2017 with the only councils holding elections being those cities, boroughs and districts in England which return one-third or one-half of their councillors at each election.  Since most of these are big cities and large towns outside London, this year's council elections have a rather urban slant.  Only by-elections take place to the London borough councils; there are no council elections in Wales this year, and Scotland misses out on the fun entirely - unless the current troubles for the First Minister end up provoking an early election to Holyrood.
</p><p>
But in voter terms, this is not a quiet year at all because of more recent constitutional innovations of the 21st century.  The London Mayor and Assembly is up for election, together with all the Police and Crime Commissioners and some of the regional mayors.  Between those categories, the whole of England and Wales has something to vote for.
</p><p>
The reason that this is the quietest local election year since 2017 is the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020-21, which led to the May 2020 local elections being postponed by a year and merged into the May 2021 local elections.  The Coronavirus Act 2020, the legal basis for this postponement, provided that once the pandemic was over council elections should go back to their previous cycle, so some of the seats up for election in May 2021 were for four-year terms (mostly the county councils) and some were for three-year terms ending in May 2024.  It's the latter category of seats that are up for re-election this year.
</p><p>
The May 2021 local elections were a very important return to normality as the COVID vaccination programme continued its work.  They also marked a very good performance for the ruling Conservative Party, which was partly ascribed to a "vaccine bounce" and which in many cases seemed to confirm the Brexit-related realignment of politics that had been seen in the December 2019 general election.  The BBC's projected national share of the vote in May 2021 gave 36% to the Conservatives, 29% to Labour and 17% to the Liberal Democrats.
</p><p>
The intervening three years have seen the Conservative vote evaporate on a national level in the face of economic stagnation, high inflation, a series of personal scandals from the Prime Ministers downwards and a general impression of incompetence in government.  The Labour Party is recording double-digit leads in the national opinion polls and has been doing so consistently for a long time.
</p><p>
Really this is the same national picture as we saw at last year's local elections in May 2023, when the projected national share was 35% for Labour, 26% for the Conservatives and 20% for the Liberal Democrats - a swing of 8% to Labour since 2021.  This was widely interpreted at first as the sort of result which presaged a hung parliament at the next general election, but the detail of the results suggests that the Brexit realignment of 2019-21 has unwound, hard.  There aren't that many Conservatives left in urban areas now, and in rural areas the party is often under threat from the Lib Dems, the Greens (who have got the knack of campaigning effectively in local elections) or both.  By contrast the newish kids on the block Reform UK are not much of a threat to the Conservatives in these local elections, mainly because they don't have much of an on-the-ground campaign infrastructure; Reform UK are only contesting around an eighth of the seats up for election this year.  Meanwhile it's not all plain sailing for Labour: in particular, there are a few areas where the war in Gaza has hit the Labour party hard and led to mass defections.
</p><p>
The Conservative Party's in-house psephologist Lord Hayward has done his usual pre-election briefing for journalists in which he suggested that the Conservatives stood to lose upwards of 400 seats - roughly half of what they are defending in these local elections.  In terms of what the 8% swing to Labour implied by last year's results means for a particular district, this column has gone for its usual metric of a "par score" - what would happen if last year's results were repeated.  If, when the results come in, you see one party doing consistently better or worse than the par score then you can reasonably conclude that their performance is better or (as the case may be) worse than last year.
</p><p>
The national political scene affects the local one in the sense that a rising tide lifts all boats, but that doesn’t mean that the tide rises to the same level in all harbours. Local elections are local, and this column is here to describe the local scene. In the rest of this piece I’ll go through England in detail, painting a more local and more varied picture for you. Links given are to results from the Local Elections Archive Project; while the maps are from 2021 or (if different) the year when these seats were last contested, and as such might not reflect the lines on which the election will actually be drawn if there are new ward boundaries this year. Council compositions were correct when this piece was drafted over the Easter weekend. Without further ado, let’s get out into the country:
</p><p>
<h2>Wales</h2>
</p><p>
Let's start with the easy bit.  With Senedd Cymru next up for election in 2026 and the Welsh local government term expiring in 2027, the only polls in Wales on 2nd May 2024 are for its four Police and Crime Commissioners.  Welsh returning officers have scrupulously avoided scheduling any local by-elections for today because of the different rules for PCC and Welsh local elections: most notably, PCC elections require Voter ID and Welsh local elections don't.  The Welsh local election franchise is also wider than the PCC franchise.
</p><p>
At the last elections Wales saw two instances of the now-abolished Supplementary Vote system resulting in a come-from-behind win for the candidate who started in second.  Both of these involved close three-way results with low vote shares for the first-preference leader, so the old system was doing its job in seeing through vote splits and ensuring that the winning candidate had the broadest possible support.
</p><p>
We can see this very clearly in <b>North Wales</b> where there was a close three-way fight in the first round in 2021.  The Conservatives led with just 32%, Labour polled 29% and Plaid Cymru (who were defending the position) 28%; Labour went on to win on transfers from Plaid and minor parties.  Labour PPC Andy Dunbobbin is seeking a second term of office.  The Conservative candidate is Brian Jones, who appeared in this column last year when he won the Rhyl Tŷ Newydd by-election to Denbighshire council.  Plaid Cymru have reselected their 2021 candidate Ann Griffith.  Richard Marbrow completes the North Wales ballot paper for the Lib Dems; there is no sign of any nomination from Mrs Trellis.
</p><p>
A similar freak vote split gave the Conservatives a tiny first-round lead in <b>Dyfed-Powys</b>, with 34.0% against 33.6% for Plaid Cymru and 24% for Labour.  Plaid's Dafydd Llywelyn was the incumbent, and he went on to win the runoff quite easily.  Llywelyn is seeking a third term of office against Powys councillor Ian Harrison for the Conservatives, Labour candidate Philippa Thompson who fought Preseli Pembrokeshire at the last two Westminster elections, and Lib Dem Justin Griffiths.
</p><p>
The two PCC positions in industrial south Wales are both safely Labour.  Last time out the first-round shares in <b>Gwent</b> were 42% for Labour, 29% for the Conservatives and 16% for Plaid Cymru.  Labour PCC Jeff Cuthbert is retiring after two terms and the new Labour candidate is Jane Mudd, the leader of Newport council; she takes on Army veteran Hannah Jarvis for the Conservatives, Caerphilly councillor Donna Cushing for Plaid and Mike Hamilton for the Lib Dems.
</p><p>
We also have a retirement in <b>South Wales</b> where octogenarian political veteran Alun Michael is standing down after three terms as Labour PCC.  He wasn't seriously challenged for his final election in 2021, polling 41% of the first preferences against 24% for the Conservatives and 19% for Plaid.  Michael's deputy Emma Wools has been selected as the new Labour candidate for South Wales PCC.  Again, this is a four-way ballot paper with the Conservatives standing George Carroll who leads the party's group on Vale of Glamorgan council, Barry town councillor Dennis Clarke being the Plaid Cymru candidate and Sam Bennett standing for the Lib Dems.
</p><p>
Last time out all of these elections were combined with the 2021 Senedd election.  For that reason, and perhaps also because this is the first Welsh election which requires Voter ID, we can expect a massive drop in turnout across the board.  Expect that to be a big story of the Welsh PCC elections, whatever result they come up with.  All these posts will count on Friday.
</p><p>

</p><p>
<h2>London</h2>
</p><p>
<h4>Mayor and Assembly</h4>
</p><p>
We now turn to the biggest single election in the UK, the sixth poll for the post of <b>Mayor of London</b>.  This is defended by Labour mayor Sadiq Khan, who in 2021 led the Conservatives' Shaun Bailey by the rather close level of 40-35 in the first round before winning the runoff decisively.  This time there will be no runoff, so we may see a mayor elected on a minority vote for the first time.
</p><p>
Khan, who won more than a million first preferences last time, is seeking re-election for a third term of office.  The Conservative candidate is Susan Hall, who has sat on the London Assembly since 2017: she originally took over the Londonwide seat left behind by Kemi Badenoch after Badenoch's election to Parliament.  Hall is also a Harrow councillor representing Hatch End ward, and she was briefly leader of that council in 2013-14 after Harrow's then Labour administration fell apart.
</p><p>
The Green Party (who were third in 2021 with 7.8%) have selected Zoë Garbett, who appeared in this column last year when she was the Green candidate in the November 2023 Hackney mayoral by-election which we shall return to presently; Garbett is a Hackney councillor representing Dalston ward.  The Lib Dem candidate (4th, 4.4%) is Rob Blackie, who works in digital marketing and has recently completed a course of treatment for cancer.  There are a number of anti-ULEZ candidates on the ballot including podcaster Brian Rose, who placed 7th here in 2021 for his London Real Party.  Defending ninth place is Count Binface, who needs no introduction.  Twelfth last time were the Animal Welfare Party who have secured top spot on the ballot paper by selecting former Afghan refugee Femy Amin: she was fourth on the party's list in 2021, and she fought Ruislip, Northwood and Pinner in December 2019.  Independent candidate Farah London, who placed 14th here in 2021, is back for another go; she will improve on that position, as will the SDP's Amy Gallagher whose party starts 17th, because this time there are only 13 candidates for the electors of London to choose from.
</p><p>
Of the candidates and parties who didn't stand last time, if the national polls are any guide then the one to watch is Howard Cox.  He is a longtime campaigner against fuel duty increases standing on a stridently anti-ULEZ and pro-motorist ticket, and he is the candidate of Reform UK.  In 2021 Reform stood on the Londonwide list (finishing 10th out of 18 parties with 1.0%) but didn't stand a candidate for mayor, instead endorsing the Reclaim candidate Laurence Fox who finished sixth in that poll with 1.9%.  Fox himself applied to stand in this election as an independent candidate, but he was one of two candidates (along with YouTuber Niko Omilana, who was 5th last time with 2.0%) who had their nominations rejected: to stand for Mayor of London you need to get the paperwork signed by ten electors from each borough plus ten electors from the City of London, and when the returning officer checked the forms there were issues with the signatures which Fox and Omilana couldn't sort out before the deadline.  That leaves three independents on the ballot: Natalie Campbell, the chancellor of the University of Westminster, is a businesswoman running a bottled water firm who applied for the Conservative nomination and didn't get it; Tarun Ghulati is an investment banker standing on an anti-ULEZ ticket; and Andreas Michli is a businessman who got into legal trouble for keeping his gym open during lockdown: he is also anti-ULEZ, and he wants Metropolitan Police officers to be trained to blue-belt level in Brazilian jiu-jitsu.  Last on the mayoral ballot is Nick Scanlon for Britain First.
</p><p>
The <b>Greater London Assembly</b> is the only English elected body to use proportional representation.  Last time around Labour polled 38% of the vote on the Londonwide list ballot and won 11 seats; the Conservatives polled 31% of the vote and won 9 seats; the Greens polled 12% and won 3 seats; and the Liberal Democrats won 2 seats with 7%, with no other parties coming close to the 5% threshold which applies to the list vote.  Other parties hoping to win representation this time are (in ballot paper order) the Animal Welfare Party, Nick Scanlon for Britain First, the Christian Peoples Alliance, the Communist Party of Britain, the Heritage Party, Reform UK, Rejoin EU, the Social Democratic Party and independent candidates Laurence Fox, Farah London and Gabe Romualdo.  To date no party has ever held the 13 seats required for an overall majority in the Assembly: to do so Labour will need to improve their list vote.
</p><p>
Results for the Mayor and Assembly will come through on Saturday.
</p><p>
<h4>By-elections</h4>
</p><p>
The London mayoral and assembly elections fall halfway through the term of the 32 London borough councils, which provides a good opportunity for mid-term by-elections to be held for relatively little cost and inconvenience.  Of the 48 local by-elections being held on 2nd May, fifteen are in Greater London.
</p><p>
We'll start our tour of the Great Wen with two polls in Hackney including the second by-election of this term in  <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/iu5m">De Beauvoir</a> ward.  This safely returned two Labour councillors in May 2022.  One of them - Tom Dewey - then resigned almost immediately, and the resulting by-election in July 2022 was very close between Labour and the Green Party with Labour holding the seat by just 27 votes.
</p><p>
At the time of that by-election it was not publicly known that Dewey had been arrested during the May 2022 election campaign on suspicion of possessing indecent images of children.  This eventually came to light in 2023 when Dewey pleaded guilty (he received a 12-month suspended prison sentence), and the resulting scandal led to the resignation of Hackney's elected mayor Philip Glanville who had been Dewey's housemate.  The mayoral by-election in November 2023 was won easily by Labour councillor Caroline Woodley; the consequential by-election for Woodley's council seat in Cazenove ward saw a farcical Labour campaign with their candidate first disendorsed and then re-endorsed, and the end result was that the seat was lost to the Conservatives on a massive swing.
</p><p>
So Hackney Labour will need to get their act together to hold the highly marginal De Beauvoir ward at this second by-election, which follows the resignation of the ward's other councillor Polly Billington.   She has been selected as the party's prospective parliamentary candidate for East Thanet.  The defending Labour candidate is Jasmine Martins, Antoinette Fernandez will hope to gain for the Green Party, and the Lib Dems' Thrusie Maurseth Cahill and the Conservatives' Tareke Gregg also stand.
</p><p>
Another Hackney Labour councillor who has Parliamentary ambitions is Steve Race, who has been selected to stand in the safe Labour seat of Exeter at the next general election and has resigned his seat in the trendy <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i05m">Hoxton East and Shoreditch</a> ward to concentrate on his campaign in Devon.  Race had first been elected in 2018 on a Labour slate that also included Feryal Demirci, as she was then; Feryal Clark is now the MP for Enfield North.  She resigned her seat on Enfield council in July 2020 but no by-election could be held for nearly a year became of the pandemic; the eventual poll in May 2021, and the subsequent Hackney council elections in 2022, both had a large Labour lead in Hoxton East and Shoreditch.  Faruk Tinaz will defend this seat for Labour against competition from Liam Davis for the Green Party, Becket McGrath for the Lib Dems and Samuel Adele for the Conservatives.
</p><p>
In neighbouring Islington we have a by-election in <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i93v">Hillrise</a> ward, which is at the northern end of the borough and runs from the Archway area to Hornsey Rise and Crouch Hill station.  This is part of the Islington North parliamentary seat represented by Labour's former leader and <em>persona non grata</em> Jeremy Corbyn; he enjoyed a big majority, and so did Hillside ward's Labour slate in 2022.  There's no Corbynite independent candidacy in this by-election; instead the unusual feature of this Hillrise ballot paper is that the Islington Conservatives either haven't found a candidate or missed the nomination deadline.  Ollie Steadman defends a safe Labour ward against competition from Alex Nettle for the Greens and Rebecca Taylor for the Lib Dems.
</p><p>
Perhaps the local Conservatives are concentrating on trying to defend one of their three remaining seats on Camden council.  The party's Camden group leader Gio Spinella resigned his seat in March for personal reasons, although a history of outspoken comments about Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Brexit suggests that he is also politically out of step with what the Conservatives have become.  This forces a by-election in <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/ih5v">Frognal</a> ward, which runs from the Finchley Road uphill uphill nearly to Hampstead underground station and is the only remaining safe Conservative ward in Camden.  Steve Adams will try to defend this seat against competition from Simon Lickert for Labour, Charles Harris for the Greens and Sarah Hoyle for the the Lib Dems.
</p><p>
Also in the dwindling number of safe Conservative wards in inner London is <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/iydr">Norland</a> ward, which covers the Victorian Norland estate in Kensington: Norland Square and the Royal Crescent are part of the ward, with Holland Park underground station on its southern boundary.  This is part of the Conservative majority on Kensington and Chelsea council, and the party's defending candidate Stephanie Petit will be challenged by Monica Press for Labour, Heloise Hunter for the Greens and Finlay Dargan for the Lib Dems.
</p><p>
The last Conservative by-election defence in North London is way out in <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i0zv">Hillingdon East</a> ward, which runs from Hillingdon underground station south to the Uxbridge Road.  It's part of the Uxbridge and South Ruislip parliamentary seat which went to the polls in a famous parliamentary by-election last summer: the Conservatives held the seat thanks to a combination of anti-ULEZ rhetoric and a boost from not having as their candidate Boris Johnson, who clearly had a strongly negative personal vote in the seat.  Hillingdon East is safely Conservative in Hillingdon council elections, as this column previously discussed in February 2020. The defending Conservative candidate Kelly Martin faces opposition from Labour's Steve Garelick, Lib Dem Tom Cottew, independent candidate Geoff Courtenay and the Green Party's Sarah Green.  The Local Elections Archive Project database, which goes back 21 years, does show that people with the surname "Green" are more likely to be Green Party candidates; maybe there's something in this nominative determinism thing.
</p><p>
Turning south we come to a Labour defence in <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i05v">Brentford West</a> ward of Hounslow borough, which is centred on the western end of the M4 Chiswick flypass; the ward includes the global headquarters of the pharmaceutical company GSK next to the floyover, although GSK are intending to move out later this year in favour of a central London location.  Brentford railway station (on the Hounslow Loop) and Boston Manor underground station lie at opposite ends of the ward.  Brentford West ward is safely part of the Labour majority on Hounslow council; the defending Labour candidate is Emma Yates, and standing against her are Freya Summersgill for the Green Party, Michael Denniss for the Conservatives, independent candidate Theo Dennison, William Francis for the Lib Dems and John Viner for the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition.
</p><p>
Taking the train from Brentford station towards Waterloo we come to Putney station, which is located at the northeast corner of <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/iflw">West Putney</a> ward.  <!-- READ ADAM GRAY STUFF -->  This is part of the London Borough of Wandsworth, where Normal Rules Did Not Apply until Labour gained a majority on the council in 2022 after 48 years of flagship Conservative rule.  West Putney ward takes in some council or ex-council estates including part of Roehampton; it was very close in 2022 and its three seats split two to Labour and one to the Conservatives.  Labour are defending this by-election with their candidate Jane Briginshaw, the Conservatives have selected Nick Austin, and also standing are Fergal McEntee for the Green Party and Mark Lejman for the Lib Dems.
</p><p>
Another marginal ward which Labour have to defend in South London is <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/it8v">St Helier West</a>.  The large St Helier estate - named after former London County Council alderman Baroness St Helier - is split between the boroughs of Merton and Sutton; we're in the southern, Sutton part of the estate here.  Sutton council has been under Liberal Democrat control since 1990 and for most of that period Labour have drawn a blank in local elections here, but the Labour party returned to the council in 2022 by gaining three seats.  One of those was in St Helier West ward, which is centred on St Helier Hospital; this ward was very close three ways in 2022, with Labour winning one seat on 32%, the Conservatives two seats on 31% and the Lib Dems close behind on 28%.  Labour's candidate Margaret Thomas has the task of defending this seat; the Conservatives have selected Catherine Gray; the Lib Dems candidate is Noor Sumun; and two independent candidates stand, "Hamilton Activist Kingsley" aka Kingsley Hamilton who was an anti-ULEZ candidate in last year's Uxbridge and South Ruislip by-election, and Renos Costi.
</p><p>
In bankrupt Croydon, the Conservatives' attempts to sort out the financial mess left behind by the borough's previous Labour administration will not be helped by the borough's electoral services team having to organise two by-elections.  These are one defence each for the Conservatives and Labour, who are currently tied for first place on the council at 33 seats plus one vacancy each.  However, control of the council is not at stake because Croydon moved in 2022 to the elected mayoral system and its Conservative mayor will serve until at least 2026.
</p><p>
For the second time in three years the London Mayor and Assembly elections are combined with a by-election in <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/iggu">Park Hill and Whitgift</a>, a small ward to the east of Croydon town centre which is served by Sandilands and Lloyd Park tram stops.  This is safely Conservative.  Defending candidate Andrew Price, a former Croydon councillor for the neighbouring Addiscombe area, will take on Labour's Melanie Felten, the Green Party's James Cork, the Lib Dems' Andrew Pelling (who has previously represented this area as a Conservative MP and London Assembly member and has also served on Croydon council for both the Conservative and Labour parties in the past), the Trade and Socialist Coalition's Ben Goldstone and independent candidate Mark Samuel, a regular feature of Croydon local by-elections who sometimes reaches the dizzy heights of ten votes.
</p><p>
Another Croydon ward which featured in the May 2021 megapreview and is having another by-election now is <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/iwgu">Woodside</a>, which lies in the north-east of the borough; it is served by Norwood Junction railway station and by a number of tram stops on the lines to Elmers End and Beckenham.  This is a safe Labour ward with a long ballot paper: defending Labour candidate Jessica Rich takes on Titilope Adeoye for the Conservatives, Nicholas Burman-Vince for the Greens, Jahir Hussain for the Lib Dems, Shane Sobers for the Taking the Initiative Party of Britain, and Michelle Wall of the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition.
</p><p>
Labour have two further seats to defend in Lambeth borough.  In <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i4qx">Knight's Hill</a> ward, which covers the West Norwood area, outgoing councillor Sonia Winifred has fallen out with the party.  Her former ward is safely in the Labour column; defending Labour candidate Emma Nye takes on the Greens' Torla Evans, the Conservatives' Leila Yaasen, the Lib Dems' Nicholas Sanders and independent candidate Janet Gayle.
</p><p>
Meanwhile in <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/ibrx">Streatham Common and Vale</a> Tom Rutland has resigned from another safe Labour ward to focus on a Parliamentary campaign in Sussex: he will stand as the Labour candidate for East Worthing and Shoreham at the next general election.  Here the Labour defence is led by Sarah Cole, while the opposition candidates are Duncan Eastoe for the Green Party, Promise Phillips for the Conservatives and Nicholas Davidson for the Lib Dems.
</p><p>
Moving over the border into what was once Kent, the electors of Lewisham's <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/ihbw">Deptford</a> ward are being called out for their third by-election in six months following a previous council by-election in November and the Lewisham mayoral by-election in May.  This is the latest in a chain of polls which was set off by the Conservative government introducing the Offshore Petroleum Licensing Bill to Parliament in January: that led to the resignation of Conservative MP Chris Skidmore, the resulting February by-election in the Kingswood parliamentary seat was gained by Labour candidate Damian Egan who had previously been Lewisham's elected mayor, and the mayoralty which he left behind was won in the resulting March by-election by his former deputy, Labour candidate Brenda Dacres.  Dacres had previously been a councillor for the safe-Labour Deptford ward, and when she won the Lewisham mayoralty her Lewisham council seat was automatically vacated.  David Walker leads the Labour defence this time against the Greens' Adam Pugh, the Conservatives Hugh Rees-Beaumont, Lib Dem Jean Branch and independent Tan Bui.
</p><p>
For our final London by-election of 2nd May it's back to the suburbs as we travel to the Bromley ward of <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i2lw">Shortlands and Park Langley</a>.  This is safely Conservative based on the 2022 results but looks likely to be closely fought nonetheless: most of the seat is within the future Beckenham and Penge parliamentary seat which is transformed by the boundary changes from safe Conservative to knife-edge marginal, so everybody will be looking to make a good impression here.  Departing councillor Aisha Cuthbert has her own parliamentary ambitions as she will be the next Conservative candidate for Sittingbourne and Sheppey, further down the Chatham railway line.  Gemma Turrell is seeking to defend Cuthbert's Bromley council seat against challenges from Labour's Charlotte Grievson, the Lib Dems' Gita Bapat, Edward Apostolides of Reform UK and independent candidate Brendan Donegan.

<h2>North East</h2>
</p><p>
<h4>Mayors</h4>
</p><p>
We'll now commence our tour of England outside London by starting in the North East, where everybody has at least two votes: one for a regional mayor, one for a Police and Crime Commissioner, and possibly a local council election on top.  Because the mayoral and police boundaries don't match up, I'll take this region as a single section.
</p><p>
The two mayoral contests in this region are a large one and a small one.  The large one is for the <b>North East</b> Mayoral Combined Authority, a new body which is taking over from the former North of Tyne Combined Authority and the former North East Combined Authority.  The new body covers the metropolitan county of Tyne and Wear together with the Durham and Northumberland council areas.
</p><p>
The presence here of the strongly Labour-voting county of Tyne and Wear means that this post should be Labour's to lose.  If we add together the 2021 results in the Northumbria and Durham police areas while deducting votes cast in Darlington (which is not part of this mayoral area), then we get a Labour lead of 46-33 over the Conservatives.  In the 2019 general election the constituencies covering this area returned 15 Labour MPs and six Conservatives, with the latter tally including the Sedgefield constituency which straddles the Durham-Darlington council boundary.
</p><p>
This new mayoral post supersedes the North of Tyne mayoral position which went to the polls in 2021.  That was won by Labour candidate Jamie Driscoll, who was very much on the left of the party and was blocked from the Labour nomination for the new mayoral post.  He is standing as an independent.  The official Labour candidate is Kim McGuinness, who is currently the Northumbria police and crime commissioner.  The Conservative candidate is Guy Renner-Thompson, who is a Northumberland councillor for Bamburgh division; he sits on the Northumberland council cabinet, with the children's and education portfolio.  Also standing (in ballot paper order) are Paul Donaghy for Reform UK, Andrew Gray for the Green Party and Aidan King for the Lib Dems.  One opinion poll in the last week of the campaign has shown a close fight between Labour and Driscoll.
</p><p>
The smaller mayoral position in this region is the <b>Tees Valley</b> mayoralty, which covers the five boroughs of Darlington, Hartlepool, Middlesbrough, Redcar and Cleveland, and Stockton-on-Tees.  This has been held since its establishment in 2017 by Lord Houchen of High Leven, a Conservative mayor who was re-elected for a second term in 2021 with a crushing 72-28 over Labour in a straight fight; despite this, Houchen has never been far away from the pages of <em>Private Eye</em>, and local election results in the five boroughs last year were not encouraging for him.  Houchen is seeking a third term of office against Labour candidate Chris McEwan, who is deputy leader of Darlington council; this time there will not be a straight fight, with the Lib Dems' Simon Thorley intervening.  An opinion poll during the campaign, published by Redfield and Wilton with fieldwork from 17-19 April, put Houchen and McEwan neck-and-neck on 47% each.
</p><p>
Counting for both of these mayoral positions will be on Friday.
</p><p>
<h4>Police and Crime Commissioners</h4>
</p><p>
As stated, the current <b>Northumbria</b> PCC Kim McGuinness is seeking election as the first North East mayor.  She leaves behind a safe PCC position in the Northumbria police area, covering both the Tyne and Wear county and Northumberland, where in 2021 she polled 47% against 31% for the Conservatives and 12% for an independent candidate.  Hoping to take over for Labour is Susan Dungworth, whose recent electoral record has been accident-prone: she was the Labour candidate who lost the safe seat of Blyth Valley in the 2019 general election, and she went on to lose her Northumberland council seat in Hartley ward in 2021 on the returning officer's drawing of lots after tying for first place with the Conservative candidate.  This time her Conservative opposition comes from Ros Munro, a communications professional who has previously worked in the criminal justice system.  Independent candidate Musataque Rahman and Lib Dem John Appleby also stand.
</p><p>
The <b>Durham</b> PCC position, which covers the Durham council area and Darlington, was extremely close in 2021: new Labour candidate Joy Allen won the runoff by just 51-49 over the much-travelled Conservative candidate George Jabbour, who has since finally achieved elected office as a North Yorkshire councillor.  The margin on first preferences was even closer, at 43.8-43.0 to Labour.  Allen is seeking a second term of office against the Conservatives' Rob Potts, who is a Durham county councillor and former police officer, and the Lib Dems' Nigel Boddy.
</p><p>
The Conservatives won everything up for election in the Tees Valley boroughs in 2021, including the <b>Cleveland</b> PCC: Steve Turner gained the position from Labour by the wide margin of 54-29.  Turner is seeking a second term; he is opposed in a straight fight by Labour candidate and Middlesbrough councillor Matt Storey.
</p><p>
Counting for all of these PCC positions will be on Friday.
</p><p>
<h4>Local elections</h4>
</p><p>
There are elections this year for all councillors in North Tyneside on new boundaries (but not the mayor, whose term runs to 2025), and for one-third of councillors in Gateshead, Newcastle upon Tyne, South Tyneside, Sunderland and Hartlepool.  All of these count overnight except for North Tyneside, where results will be announced on Saturday.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/sunderland21.png" alt="Sunderland, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
It's traditional to start in <b>Sunderland</b>, which makes a point of trying to be first to declare its council results - although, with PCC and mayoral votes to be verified before the local count can begin, that might not be the case this year.  The danger for Sunderland Labour in recent years now appears to have passed, and the council currently has a large Labour majority with 47 seats against 13 Conservatives, 12 Lib Dems, 3 independents and 1 for Reform UK.  The 2021 results saw big gains for the Conservatives and Lib Dems in Sunderland proper, but the par score is for Labour to gain five seats.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/hartlepool21.png" alt="Hartlepool, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Instead the one to watch in this region is <b>Hartlepool</b>, which was left on a knife-edge by the 2023 elections: Labour have 18 seats, half of the council, but they are shut out of power by 12 Conservatives, 6 independents and the mayoral casting vote.  This year Labour are only defending Victoria ward and a by-election gain from the independents in Foggy Furze ward <!-- 2022-09-08 -->.  They only need one gain to take control of the council; last year's elections saw a Labour landslide here, and this column sets a par score of <em>seven</em> Labour gains in Hartlepool at this election.
</p><p>
The other four Tyne and Wear boroughs have large Labour majorities which are not in serious danger.  The outgoing localist councillor for Lemington ward in Newcastle resigned shortly before the election and there hasn't been time to hold a by-election to replace him.  This means that readers of this column didn't get to see my photograph of the surviving section of Hadrian's Wall that runs through Lemington ward, right next to the A69 arterial road.  Let's rectify that.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/hadrians-wall-lemington.jpg" alt="Hadrian's Wall, Lemington" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
There definitely had been time for a by-election in the Cullercoats ward of North Tyneside, where a seat has been vacant for nearly eight months following the death of Conservative councillor Linda Arkley.  She was a high-profile political veteran, having been first elected to the council in 1991 for Tynemouth ward.  In June 2003 there was a by-election for Mayor of North Tyneside after Conservative mayor Christopher Morgan was forced to resign over a child pornography scandal; he was found not guilty on all charges at the time, but was successfully prosecuted for similar offences many years later.  Arkley held the mayoralty for the Conservatives in the 2003 by-election, lost it to Labour in 2005, got it back in 2009 but lost re-election again in 2013.  In 2018 Linda Arkley was appointed OBE for political service in the north-east of England; after unsuccessfully applying for the Conservative nomination for the 2021 North of Tyne mayoral election, she returned to North Tyneside council in 2021 as councillor for Cullercoats ward.  Arkley passed away in October at the age of 71, and nobody ever called a by-election for her vacant seat.
</p><p>
In the rest of the North East mayoral area we have a by-election to Durham council in <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/ihqp">Horden</a> ward, which lies on the Durham coast immediately to the east of the New Town of Peterlee and is now part of Peterlee's urban area.  Horden railway station, on the Durham coast line, has recently reopened.  This is a classic ex-mining community and, like many classic ex-mining communities, its local elections have tended to be Labour versus independent; however, in recent years the independent role here has been taken over by the North East Party, a regionalist movement which has a local powerbase in Peterlee.  Nonetheless this is a safe Labour ward which the party are defending following the death of councillor Isabella Roberts at the end of February.  The defending Labour candidate June Clark takes on Bobby Fishwick for the North East Party, George Carter for the Conservatives and Neil Thompson for the Lib Dems.

<h2>Cumbria</h2>
</p><p>
<h4>Police and Crime Commissioner</h4>
</p><p>
In Cumbria the main action is in the PCC election, which is defended by the Conservatives.  The outgoing PCC Peter McCall won last time in the first round, with 54% of the vote against 26% for Labour and 20% for the Lib Dems.  Local elections in the county since have not been promising for the Conservatives: Cumbria's local government was reorganised in 2023, with Labour holding a majority in the new Cumberland council and the Lib Dems having overall control in Westmorland and Furness.
</p><p>
McCall is standing down, and the new Conservative candidate is his current deputy Mike Johnson who is leader of the Conservative group on Cumberland council, used to lead the former Allerdale council, and runs a welding/fabrication business in Cumbria.  The Labour candidate David Allen has previously had a distinguished police career, rising from probationary constable in Carlisle to a senior position with Interpol and retiring as head of the UK International Crime Bureau.  The Lib Dems have selected Adrian Waite, who is an accountant and Kirkby Stephen town councillor; he completes a ballot paper of three.  Counting for this post will take place overnight.
</p><p>
<h4>Local elections</h4>
</p><p>
Apart from parish council elections, the only council poll in Cumbria this year is a by-election to Westmorland and Furness council.  This is for <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/idzx">Grange and Cartmel</a> ward, which is the Furness part of the council - or Lancashire Beyond the Sands, as it used to be known because the main access to Furness was across the sands of Morecambe Bay.  This treacherous route (passable at low tide only) led to Grange-over-Sands, which the Victorians developed as a seaside resort: walkers on Grange's promenade can look out over not sands but saltmarsh, because the River Kent has changed its course since the prom was built.  Even now the quickest access to Grange is by rail, with the viaduct over the Kent estuary cutting miles off the road to the town.  Grange is in a single ward with the village of Cartmel, known for its racecourse; the ward extends north for some distance through hilly terrain to take in much of the eastern shore of Windermere.
</p><p>
Westmorland and Furness council returned a Lib Dem majority at its first elections in 2022.  The Liberal Democrats are extremely weak in the district's largest town of Barrow-in-Furness, and it follows from that they performed extremely well in the rural areas.  Grange and Cartmel ward is safely part of the Lib Dem majority.  The party's defending candidate Andy Hull is opposed in this by-election by Ally Hibbert for the Conservatives and Martin Powell-Davies for the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition.
</p><p>
<h2>Lancashire</h2>
</p><p>
This will be covered in Part IV - the Parliamentary Special.
</p><p>
<h2>Merseyside and Cheshire</h2>
</p><p>
I've taken the Merseyside and Cheshire police areas together because of the presence of Halton borough, which is part of the Cheshire PCC election but also participates in the election of the Liverpool City Region mayor alongside the five Merseyside boroughs.
</p><p>
<h4>Mayor</h4>
</p><p>
The Liverpool City Region mayoralty has been held since its creation in 2017 by Labour's Steve Rotheram, who won re-election in 2021 with a 58-20 lead over the Conservatives.  Since 2021 Rotheram has negotiated a deal which will give the combined authority control over bus franchising, allowing the mayor to specify routes, frequencies and fares.  There is nothing to suggest he will struggle to be re-elected for a third term.  The Conservative candidate from last time Jade Marsden is back for another go; also standing are Tom Crone for the Green Party, Rob McAllister-Bell for the Lib Dems and independent candidate Ian Smith, whom this column has noted standing in a couple of recent local by-elections in Bootle.  Results for this post are expected on Saturday.
</p><p>
<h4>Police and Crime Commissioners</h4>
</p><p>
The Merseyside PCC position is equally safe for the Labour incumbent Emily Spurrell, who had a 57-23 lead over the Conservatives in 2021.  She is seeking another term; opposing her are returning Conservative candidate and former Merseyside police sergeant Bob Teesdale, Christopher Carubia for the Lib Dems and Amanda Onwuemene for the Green Party.
</p><p>
Cheshire PCC, by contrast, is consistently marginal.  First preferences here in 2021 were 45% for the Conservatives, 37% for Labour and 14% for the Lib Dems, with the Conservative candidate John Dwyer going on to gain the position from Labour.  Dwyer is seeking a second term; the Labour candidate is engineer and former Warrington councillor Dan Price; and the Lib Dems' Paul Duffy also stands.  Counting for both PCC elections will be on Friday.
</p><p>
<h4>Local elections</h4>
</p><p>
There are elections here for the whole of Warrington council, and for one-third of councillors in Halton, Knowsley and Sefton.  All of these councils have large Labour majorities, although in the case of <b>Warrington</b> Labour have put in some indifferent by-election results over the last three years and the council continues to generate publicity over its very high debt level.  Sefton counts overnight, Halton and Knowsley on Friday afternoon and Warrington on Saturday.
</p><p>
There's also not much of excitement in Cheshire's local by-election today, which is in the <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i5zu">Wolverham</a> ward of Cheshire West and Chester council.  This covers the south-eastern end of Ellesmere Port, including the Cheshire Oaks outlet village, and it is a place where the Labour vote is not counted but weighed.  Despite this, we have a lot of candidates seeking to take on the defending Labour candidate John Stockton: he is up against Luke Sharples for the Conservatives, Lizzie Jewkes who is not cheap jewellery from Argos but is in fact the Lib Dem candidate, Kate Grannell for the Green Party, Sally James who is the first local by-election candidate for the newly-formed Party of Women, and independent Jonathan Starkey.
</p><p>
<h2>Greater Manchester</h2>
</p><p>
<h4>Mayors</h4>
</p><p>
Possibly the most powerful of all England's regional mayoralties is that in Greater Manchester, where Andy Burnham has built up a nice little empire.  The <b>Greater Manchester</b> Combined Authority has control over (among other things) Greater Manchester Police, the county's health and social care budget, and most prominently the buses.
</p><p>
Having successfully seen off legal challenges from bus companies, Burnham is presently in the middle of a high-profile and very visible reform of Greater Manchester's bus network.  Greater Manchester was the first part of England to cap bus single fares at £2 (which represented a massive fare cut), and buses across the north of the county are now fully regulated and franchised under the banner of the Bee Network - with the south of the county to follow at the start of next year.  Yellow Bee Network buses are now a familiar sight on Greater Manchester's roads.  Mayor Burnham has achieved all this without resorting to road user charging: plans for a Clean Air Zone - in the vein of London's ULEZ - have apparently been seen off in favour of investment in electric buses and taxis to reduce pollution.
</p><p>
All this, together with visibly sticking up for the county and indeed the region during the COVID-19 pandemic, has made Labour's Andy Burnham one of the most popular politicians in the country.  In 2021 he won a second term of office as mayor with 67% of the first preference vote, with only the Conservatives (20%) providing any sort of opposition.  A ward-level breakdown of that vote was published, and Burnham carried not just every borough but every <em>ward</em> in Greater Manchester - including bastions of the middle class like Bramhall, Hale Barns and Bromley Cross.
</p><p>
Nothing has happened since to suggest that Burnham will struggle for re-election, and an opinion poll in the last week of the campaign gave him another massive lead.  The Conservatives had to reselect at the last minute after their original candidate Dan Barker walked off to join Reform UK, and they have ended up with former Trafford councillor Laura Evans who was their candidate last time; also standing are Hannah Spencer for the Green Party, Jake Austin for the Lib Dems, the aforementioned Dan Barker for Reform UK, and independent candidate Nick Buckley who was the Reform UK candidate three years ago.  Counting for this post will be on Saturday.
</p><p>
Andy Burnham's designated deputy mayor is Labour's Paul Dennett, who is himself up for re-election this year as the elected mayor of <b>Salford</b>.  Neither of his two election wins to date went to transfers: in 2021 Dennett won a second term of office with a 59-23 lead over the Conservatives.  He is seeking a third term against opposition from the Conservatives' Jillian Collinson (councillor for Boothstown and Ellenbrook ward), David Jones of the Green Party and Sally Griffiths of the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition.  Results for the Salford mayoral election are expected on Saturday evening.
</p><p>
<h4>Local elections</h4>
</p><p>
There are local elections for one-third of the councillors in every Greater Manchester borough.  Of these, eight have Labour majorities and two are under no overall control.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2023/bolton23.png" alt="Bolton, 2023" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
As usual, the one to watch is <b>Bolton</b>.  This had a whole-council election in 2023 which returned a hung council of 26 Labour councillors, 17 Conservatives, 6 Lib Dems and 11 localists: the latter broke down as 6 seats for Horwich and Blackrod First, 3 members of the One Kearsley party and 2 seats for Farnworth and Kearsley First.  Labour formed a minority administration, ending four years of Conservative minority rule in the Greatest Town in the Known Universe.  The One Kearsley party subsequently disbanded: one of their councillors resigned provoking a by-election in Kearsley ward which was won by Farnworth and Kearsley First, and the other two ex-One Kearsley councillors joined Labour putting the party three seats short of an overall majority.
</p><p>
Opportunities for Labour gains here are limited because they are defending 11 of the borough's 20 wards, including the defection gain in Kearsley.  The party is defending split wards from the Conservatives in Astley Bridge, Breightmet and your columnist's own Little Lever and Darcy Lever; all of these are or soon will be in the very marginal parliamentary seat of Bolton North East.  Labour will also be under pressure from Farnworth and Kearsley First in Farnworth South and Kearsley wards.  The best opportunities for Labour gains are in Hulton, where the Conservative councillor up for election was disendorsed by the party during the 2023 campaign and is seeking re-election as an independent, and in the perennially unpredictable ward of Westhoughton South which the Liberal Democrats are defending.  The Lib Dems are also defending a by-election gain from the Conservatives in Westhoughton North and Hunger Hill.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2022/bury22.png" alt="Bolton, 2023" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
<b>Bury</b> council now has a Labour majority which looks secure enough: they have 31 seats against 11 Conservatives, 7 Radcliffe First localists and 2 independents (one of whom was elected on the Radcliffe First ticket).  The seats being defended here are from all-out elections in 2022; the par score is for just one ward to change hands, with the Conservatives gaining Radcliffe North and Ainsworth from Radcliffe First.  Radcliffe North and Ainsworth is transferring from the very marginal seat of Bury South to the equally marginal seat of Bury North for the next general election.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2022/rochdale22.png" alt="Rochdale, 2022" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
In <b>Rochdale</b> Labour hold three-quarters of the council seats but neither of the borough's two MPs: the Heywood and Middleton constituency is held by the Conservatives' Chris Clarkson with a small majority, while the Rochdale constituency is now in the hands of George Galloway after the Labour campaign in the recent parliamentary by-election cruckled.  (If you don't understand what that means, ask a Rochdalian.)  The forthcoming parliamentary boundary changes transfer Spotland and Falinge ward from Galloway's seat to Clarkson's, which is very unhelpful for both of them; indeed, the redrawn Heywood and Middleton North has a notional Labour majority, and Clarkson has decided not to seek re-election to Parliament.  Control of the council is not up for grabs here, but it might be interesting to see if the Gallowayite Workers Party candidates can do well in the Muslim wards of Rochdale proper - something similar happened in Bradford immediately following the Bradford West by-election a decade ago.  Again, the seats up for election in Rochdale are from all-out elections in 2022: the par score is for Labour to confirm a defection gain from the Middleton Independents Party in East Middleton ward, with no changes elsewhere.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2023/oldham23.png" alt="Rochdale, 2023" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
All-out elections in <b>Oldham</b> last year returned a small Labour majority in the Home of the Tubular Bandage, with 32 seats against 11 Conservatives, 10 Lib Dems, 4 independents and 3 Failsworth localists.  Labour have since recruited to their banner Hussain Aftab, an independent councillor for St Mary's ward, while the three Conservative councillors for Hollinwood ward - which is not natural Conservative territory in any sense - have walked out of the party and formed their own group.  Labour have seats to defend in the split wards of Failsworth West (from independents), Royton South (from independents) and St James' (from the Conservatives); the Lib Dems are defending Saddleworth North ward, where the other two councillors are Conservative, and Shaw ward where an independent topped the poll in 2023.
</p><p>
There were also all-out elections last year in Greater Manchester's other hung council, <b>Stockport</b>.  Amazingly for a borough which includes places like Cheadle, Bramhall and Marple, this is now a Tory-free zone: the 2023 elections returned 30 Lib Dem councillors, 24 Labour, and three seats each for the Green Party, the Heald Green Ratepayers and the Edgeley Community Association.  The wards with split representation are Bredbury and Woodley, Cheadle East and Cheadle Hulme North, and Offerton: all of these are being defended by Labour this year against the Lib Dems.  The Liberal Democrats run a minority administration: for an overall majority they need to gain two of those wards and hold the nine seats they are defending.
</p><p>
The <b>Salford</b> elected mayoralty was covered above.  Labour have large majorities on that council and in <b>Manchester</b>, <b>Tameside</b>, <b>Trafford</b> and <b>Wigan</b> which are under no threat at all.
</p><p>
Bolton, Oldham, Stockport, Tameside and Wigan count overnight; Bury, Manchester, Rochdale and Trafford will count on Friday; while in Salford the mayoral result will come out on Saturday but the council elections will not be declared until Sunday.

<h2>West Yorkshire</h2>
</p><p>
<h4>Mayor</h4>
</p><p>
Like her counterpart over the Pennines, the Mayor of West Yorkshire has control over the police and so there is no Police and Crime Commissioner for the county.  Labour's Tracey Brabin won the inaugural West Yorkshire mayoral election in 2021 easily, polling 43% of the first preferences against 29% for the Conservatives and 10% for the Yorkshire Party.  Brabin had to resign her parliamentary seat in Batley and Spen in consequence; Labour just about held the resulting by-election under pressure from both the Conservatives and George Galloway, before going on to gain a parliamentary by-election in Wakefield from the Conservatives the following year.
</p><p>
Tracy Brabin is seeking re-election for a second term.  The Conservatives have selected Arnold Craven, who works in the energy sector.  Last year's Yorkshire Party candidate Box Buxton, who teaches engineering students, is back for another go.  Also standing are Andrew Cooper for the Green Party, Stewart Golton for the Lib Dems and independent candidate Jonathan Tilt, who is an acupuncturist by trade.
</p><p>
<h4>Local elections</h4>

<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/kirklees21.png" alt="Kirklees, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
There are local elections for a third of councillors in the five West Yorkshire boroughs, all of which have Labour majorities.  The most marginal of these is <b>Kirklees</b> borough, covering the Huddersfield and Dewsbury areas, which has a Labour majority of one seat: 35 councillors against 18 Conservatives, 8 Lib Dems, 4 members of a Labour splinter group, 3 Greens and an ex-Labour independent.  One of the defectors is up for re-election this year: that's Ebrahim Dockrat, who won a by-election in Batley East ward only last August.  A repeat of last year's results would see Labour improve their position by one seat net, gaining Denby Dale and Holme Valley South wards from the Conservatives but losing Golcar ward to the Liberal Democrats.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/calderdale21.png" alt="Calderdale, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Meanwhile in <b>Calderdale</b> we have an only slightly larger Labour majority, with 27 councillors against 15 Conservative seats (one of which is vacant), 6 Lib Dems, 2 Greens and an ex-Labour independent.  The par score is for the Conservatives to lose three seats here: a repeat of 2023 would see Elland ward and Illingworth and Mixenden ward going to Labour and Northowram and Shelf ward going to the Green Party.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/bradford21.png" alt="Bradford, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
In <b>Bradford</b> the Labour majority has been eroded by defections in recent months: there are currently 53 Labour councillors, 15 Conservatives, 8 Greens, 5 Lib Dems and 9 independents of various political hues.  Labour probably shouldn't be too worried about that: a repeat of 2023 would deliver seven Labour net gains here.  The Labour majority in <b>Leeds</b> is under little threat, and in <b>Wakefield</b> the Conservative group has fallen apart so badly that the party is notionally defending eight wards but only has five councillors left.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/wakefield21.png" alt="Wakefield, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
All West Yorkshire councils count on Friday with the mayoral result due on Saturday.
</p><p>
<h2>North Yorkshire</h2>
</p><p>
Another new piece in the devolution jigsaw falls into place this year with the creation of a new combined authority for <b>York and North Yorkshire</b>.  This will have the power to directly invest and transport and housing, and will also take over the police and crime commissioner powers.
</p><p>
That means we see the abolition of the North Yorkshire police and crime commissionership, which has been in Conservative hands since its creation in 2012.  In May 2021 North Yorkshire elected a new PCC, Philip Allott, who polled 47% of the votes in the first round against 26% for Labour and 15% for independent candidate Keith Tordoff.  Allott was forced to resign just five months later over insensitive comments about the Sarah Everard murder; the resulting by-election in November 2021 elected the Conservatives' Zoë Metcalf with 40% against 21% for Labour and 17% for Tordoff (<em>Andrew's Previews 2021</em>, page 495).
</p><p>
Subsequent polls in the county have seen the Conservatives go backwards.  North Yorkshire has recently had its local government reorganised, and the May 2022 county council elections returned a small Conservative majority which has since disappeared thanks to defection and by-election losses.  Shortly afterwards the Conservatives lost a safe parliamentary seat to Labour in the July 2022 Selby and Ainsty by-election.
</p><p>
The Conservative nomination for the new post has gone to Keane Duncan, who served as leader of the former Ryedale council from 2019 to 2021 - starting that job at the age of just 24 - and who now represents Norton-on-Derwent on North Yorkshire council.  The Labour candidate David Skaith runs a clothes shop in York and is chair of the York High Street Forum.  Keith Tordoff, a former police officer who then ran a sweetshop in Pateley Bridge, is back for another independent run; he had successfully applied for the Yorkshire Party nomination, but then left the party after a bizarre row over an election pledge to give free chickens to 20,000 households in the county.  Money for nothing, chicks for free.  Also standing are the Countess of Swinton Felicity Cunliffe-Lister for the Lib Dems, Kevin Foster for the Green Party and Paul Haslam, a North Yorkshire councillor who was elected for the Conservatives but has quit the party to stand here as an independent.   Counting will be on Friday.
</p><p>
There are no local elections this year in North Yorkshire or York.
</p><p>
<h2>Humberside</h2>
</p><p>
<h4>Police and Crime Commissioner</h4>
</p><p>
With regional mayors taking over PCC roles in North Yorkshire (above) and South Yorkshire (below), there is now only one remaining police and crime commissioner in Yorkshire.  This is in Humberside, a marginal police area where the PCC position has regularly swung between the Conservatives and Labour; despite a last-minute change of candidate in the 2021 election, the Conservatives' PCC Jonathan Evison gained the position from Labour in 2021 by a 46-39 margin.  Evison is seeking a second term; Labour will seek to gain with candidate Simon O'Rourke who is a former chair of Scunthorpe Victim Support, and the Lib Dems have nominated Bob Morgan.  Results will be counted on Friday.
</p><p>
<h4>By-elections</h4>
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/hull21.png" alt="Hull, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
There are elections this year for one-third of the councillors in Hull and North East Lincolnshire, both of which will be counted overnight.  The city of <b>Kingston upon Hull</b> is currently a two-party state, with the Lib Dems enjoying a 33-24 majority over Labour; this includes a recent by-election gain in Avenue ward and a defection gain in Longhill and Bilton Grange ward.  The Liberal Democrats are defending both of those wards this time.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/ne-lincs21.png" alt="NE Lincs, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
<b>North East Lincolnshire</b> has a large Conservative majority: there are currently 27 Conservative councillors against 9 Labour, 3 Lib Dems and 3 independents.  But, as can be seen from the map, this majority rests on a wave election in 2021 when the Conservatives won 11 wards out of a possible 12; and that hasn't been repeated since.  The par score here is for the Conservatives to lose six seats, four to Labour and two to independents: that would leave a hung council with the Conservatives relying on the mayoral casting vote.
</p><p>
<h2>South Yorkshire</h2>
</p><p>
<h4>Mayor</h4>
</p><p>
The South Yorkshire mayoralty has grown into a rather powerful position since its establishment in 2018.  Originally it was weak enough that Labour was prepared to let the job be done part-time by an MP, Dan Jarvis.  He handed a rather more beefed-up role in 2022 on to Labour's Oliver Coppard, who polled 43% of the vote against rather split opposition: 17% for the Conservatives, 13% for the Yorkshire Party and 12% for the Greens.
</p><p>
Coppard was originally elected for a four-year term running to 2026, but this has been cut short.  Further devolution to the South Yorkshire Combined Authority means that the mayor is now taking on the role of the South Yorkshire Police and Crime Commissioner Alan Billings, who was most recently re-elected in 2021 with a 54-32 lead over the Conservatives.  Billings is retiring this year, and Coppard's term has been cut short in order to bring South Yorkshire mayoral elections onto the PCC cycle.
</p><p>
Oliver Coppard is seeking a second term for Labour.  His main opposition should come from the Conservatives' Nick Allen who is a Doncaster councillor; also standing are Douglas Johnson for the Green Party, Hannah Kitchking for the Lib Dems and David Bettney for the Social Democratic Party.  Results will come through on Saturday.
</p><p>
<h4>Local elections</h4>
</p><p>
There are elections this year for the whole of Rotherham council and for one-third of the members of Barnsley and Sheffield councils, all of which will be counted on Friday.  There are no council elections this year in Doncaster.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/rotherham21.png" alt="Rotherham, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
<b>Rotherham</b> has a rather small Labour majority.  The 2021 elections here returned 32 Labour councillors, 20 Conservatives, 3 members of the Rotherham Democratic Party, 3 Lib Dems and an independent.  By-elections since then have seen Labour gain two seats, in Aughton and Swallownest ward (from the Conservatives) and in Keppel ward (from the Rotherham Democratic Party); both major parties have had a few councillors leave to become independent, while the Rotherham Democratic Party - the main remnant of the council's once-large UKIP group - has been wound up.  Most of the Conservative seats are in the Rother Valley constituency, so any Labour gains here should lead to tiresome Red Wall-related speculation.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/sheffield21.png" alt="Sheffield, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
By contrast, a messy hung council in <b>Sheffield</b> got even messier over the last term, when eight Labour councillors - including the former council leader Terry Fox - walked out of the party last October.  This has left Labour on 30 seats, one ahead of the Lib Dems on 29; there are also 14 Green councillors, 8 members of the splinter group (the "Sheffield Community Councillors Group"), an ex-Labour independent and a Conservative councillor.  The city's governance arrangements are best described as "it's complicated".  Two of the Sheffield Community Councillors Group and the ex-Labour independent are up for re-election this year.  A repeat of 2023 would see Labour gain one seat net while the Lib Dems gain two, with the Greens going backwards and the Conservatives losing their seat.  </p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/barnsley21.png" alt="Barnsley, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
The Conservatives might also lose group status in <b>Barnsley</b>: they drew a blank in the 2023 Barnsley elections and one of their two elected councillors from 2022 has since walked off to join Reform UK.  Barnsley has a large and secure Labour majority, with the Lib Dems having made gains in recent years to form the main opposition.

<h2>Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire</h2>
</p><p>
<h4>Mayor</h4>
</p><p>
Our final new mayoral election is for the grandly-named <b>East Midlands</b> Combined Authority - which does not in fact cover the whole of the East Midlands, but just the counties of Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire together with their namesake cities.
</p><p>
The Conservatives performed well over this combined area in the Johnson era.  In the 2019 general election the 21 constituencies covering those two counties returned 16 Conservative MPs and just five for Labour (the three Nottingham city seats, Derby South and Chesterfield).  Several of those are canonical Red Wall constituencies - including Chesterfield, which did not in the end fall.  In the 2021 local elections the Conservatives increased their majority on Derbyshire county council and gained overall control of Nottinghamshire county council, and the combined result of the two Police and Crime Commissioner elections gave the Conservatives a 49-40 lead over Labour.
</p><p>
Fast-forward to the 2023 local elections and things now look very different.  With every district council seat in the two counties up for election, the Conservatives now control only one district in the area: that's Rushcliffe in Nottinghamshire.  Everything else is under Labour majority or minority control, with the exceptions of Derbyshire Dales (a very rural area with a Lib Dem-led coalition in charge) and Ashfield (Zadroznyite).
</p><p>
So, there's a lot of work to do for the Conservatives to win this.  Their candidate is Ben Bradley, who is a busy man: he's currently the leader of Nottinghamshire county council and the Conservative MP for Mansfield.  The Labour candidate is Claire Ward, who was the Labour MP for Watford in Hertfordshire from 1997 to 2010 and now chairs the Sherwood Forest Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.  An opinion poll has shown her well ahead of Bradley.  Also standing are (in ballot paper order) Frank Adlington-Stringer for the Lib Dems, the mayor of Derby Alan Graves for Reform UK, independent (Zadroznyite) candidate Matt Reif and Lib Dem Helen Tamblyn-Saville.  Counting for this post will take place on Friday.
</p><p>
<h4>Police and Crime Commissioners</h4>
</p><p>
As stated, the two PCCs for the East Midlands mayoral counties were both Conservative gains from Labour in 2021.  These are definitely marginal counties: the Conservatives led Labour in Derbyshire by 49-38 and in Nottinghamshire by 48-43.
</p><p>
In Derbyshire Angelique Foster is seeking a second term of office.  Labour have selected Nicolle Ndiweni who is a former Ashfield councillor with links to both Derby and Nottingham.  The Lib Dem candidate is David Hancock and Russell Armstrong stands for Reform UK.
</p><p>
Over in Nottinghamshire we have a PCC ballot paper of three.  Caroline Henry is seeking re-election for the Conservatives, Labour have selected former police officer Gary Godden, and the Lib Dem candidate is David Watts.
</p><p>
Both of these posts will be counted on Friday after the East Midlands mayoral result is declared.
</p><p>
<h4>Local elections</h4>
</p><p>
We have three local by-elections to bring you in the East Midlands mayoral area, all of which are in fascinating marginal wards.
</p><p>
Derby and Amber Valley both came off the thirds electoral cycle last year, so there are no ordinary local elections in either Derbyshire or Nottinghamshire this time round.  However, Amber Valley council do have to organise a by-election in <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/ik5x">Crich and South Wingfield</a> ward.  This was created last year by merging the former Wingfield ward, which the Lib Dems gained from the Conservatives at a by-election in December 2022, with the former Crich ward which is known for its tramway museum.  The new ward split its two seats between the Conservatives and Lib Dems in 2023, and it's the Conservative seat which is up in this by-election following the resignation of Dawn Harper.  Both the Conservatives and the Lib Dems have selected their losing candidates from last year.  The defending Conservative candidate is Dawn Harper's husband Tony, who is a serving Crich parish councillor and has previous local government experience in Nottinghamshire: Tony Harper has served on Nottinghamshire county council (Eastwood division, 2017-21) and Broxtowe council (Eastwood Hall ward, 2015-19), and he was the unsuccessful Conservative candidate for Nottinghasmhire police and crime commissioner in 2016 and for Ashfield in the 2017 general election, on that occasion losing by just 441 votes.  The Lib Dem candidate is Marcus Johnson, who is a South Wingfield parish councillor; if he wins, the Lib Dems will be able to form a group on Amber Valley council.  Also standing are Amy Trewick for Labour and Fiona Horton for the Greens.
</p><p>
I mentioned Broxtowe council in the previous paragraph, and there is a by-election to that council in <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i4ds">Attenborough and Chilwell East</a> ward, which rises up from the Trent floodplain to take in the named areas of Nottingham suburbia to the north.  Despite the order of names Chilwell East is the larger part of the ward, and its connections to Nottingham city centre have been improved in recent years by the opening of the Toton branch of Nottingham's tram system.  This ward had been marginal in 2019 but was convincingly gained by Labour in 2023 as Labour took overall control of Broxtowe council.  The defending Labour candidate Tyler Marsh takes on Conservative former ward councillor Eric Kerry, Mary Venning for the Greens and Simon Roche for the Lib Dems.
</p><p>
Further up the Trent we come to <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/iejl">Melbourne</a> - the original Derbyshire town of Melbourne, from which the nineteenth-century British prime minister Viscount Melbourne and (via him) the Australian city of Melbourne took their names.  Melbourne town is a backwater now, but in times past this was an important place because Melbourne lay close to the southern end of Swarkestone Bridge.  This is a mediaeval (and relatively unmodernised) stone bridge and causeway nearly a mile in length which crosses the Trent and its marshes; for centuries Swarkestone Bridge was the only fixed crossing of the river between Burton and Nottingham.  There was a small battle there in the English Civil War, and Swarkestone Bridge marked the point where Bonnie Prince Charlie's forces turned back during the 1745 Jacobite rebellion.  Melbourne is normally a safely Conservative ward, so it says something about how far the party shrunk last year in South Derbyshire district that the ward's two seats split between the Conservatives and Labour in 2023.  The Conservatives are defending this by-election with their candidate Matthew Gotheridge, while Labour's Jackie Lane will hope to gain the seat and increase the Labour majority on South Derbyshire council; also standing are Jonathan Wood for the Green Party, John James for the Lib Dems and Liam Booth-Isherwood for Reform UK.
</p><p>
<h2>Lincolnshire</h2>
</p><p>
<h4>Police and Crime Commissioner</h4>
</p><p>
The Lincolnshire PCC position was very safely Conservative in 2021, and Marc Jones' 60% of the vote was the highest percentage share for any winning PCC candidate that year.  Labour trailed in a long way behind with a second-place score of 20%.  This year Jones is seeking re-election for a third term, the Labour candidate is former police officer Mike Horder, and also standing are Lesley Rollings for the Lib Dems, Peter Escreet for Reform UK and David Dickason for the English Democrats.
</p><p>
<h4>Local elections</h4>
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/lincoln21.png" alt="Lincoln, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
The only East Midlands district which has retained thirds elections is <b>Lincoln</b>, where one-third of the city council will be up for election together with a county council by-election in Park division.  Labour have a large majority on the city council; they have been losing seats to the Lib Dems in recent years, but that should be more than offset this year by gains from the Conservatives.
</p><p>
Also in Lincoln we have a by-election to the county council in <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/ixpt">Park</a> division, which doesn't have the same boundaries as the Park ward on the above map: the county division takes in most of that ward plus the southern half of Abbey ward, so here we have most of the downhill part of the city centre.  Including the bridge over the River Witham on the High Street, which is locally known as the Glory Hole.  The riverside footpath here has recently reopened after essential repairs, with press reports on the work producing a series of golden opportunities for headline writers; <a href="https://tinyurl.com/4ffn65v9">this one from the <em>Metro</em></a> <!--Workmen are grabbing their tools to begin a shift at Lincoln’s Glory Hole--> definitely showed what can be done within the bounds of Clickbait That's Just About Safe For Work.
</p><p>
Anyway, the voters of Park division will be electing a replacement for Labour county councillor Julie Killey, who passed away in March.  She had a safe division in 2021; since then the Lib Dems have won all three seats in Abbey ward, but their continuing weakness in Park ward - and a rare intervention from the continuing Liberal Party - could hold the Lib Dems back in any challenge for the county council seat.  Defending Labour candidate Debbie Armiger takes on Charlie Rogers of the Conservatives, Martin Christopher of the Lib Dems, Sally Horscroft of the Greens, Jane Smith of Reform UK, Emma Knight of the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition and Charles Shaw of the Liberal Party.
</p><p>
All of Lincolnshire's elections this year will be counted overnight.
</p><p>
<h2>Northamptonshire</h2>
</p><p>
Most of Northamptonshire last went to the polls in 2021, when all of the county's elected offices were up at once: the whole of the new North Northamptonshire and West Northamptonshire councils, and the police and crime commissioner election in which the Conservatives' Stephen Mold was re-elected for a second term with a 53-28 lead over Labour.  Mold has proven to be a controversy magnet in office, attracting adverse press in July 2023 over an incident where he appointed Nicci Marzec as the county's interim fire chief, she lasted only ten days and he was forced to deny rumours that they were in a relationship.  In March Mold was effectively forced into a last-minute retirement for making misogynistic comments about Northamptonshire's replacement chief fire officer, Nikki Watson.
</p><p>
The PCC poll is Northamptonshire's only election today and will be counted on Friday.  The Conservative candidate is Martin Emberson, who has previously served for nine years as the county's chief fire officer.  Labour have selected Danielle Stone, who is a West Northamptonshire councillor and previously led the Labour group on the former Northampton council.  Also standing is the Lib Dems' Ana Gunn who comes straight back to the campaign trail after contesting the recent Wellingborough parliamentary by-election.
</p><p>
<h2>Leicestershire</h2>
</p><p>
<h4>Police and Crime Commissioner</h4>
</p><p>
The Conservatives gained the Leicestershire Police and Crime Commissioner position in 2021, with former MEP and paranormal author Rupert Matthews enjoying a big swing to win by 49-33 over Labour.  These figures include Rutland, as England's "smallest" "county" is part of the Leicestershire police area.
</p><p>
Rupert Matthews is seeking a second term against competition from another former member of the European Parliament: Rory Palmer was a Labour MEP for the East Midlands from 2017 to 2020 and served on Leicester city council before that.  Also standing are Ian Sharpe for the Lib Dems, Fizza Askari for "One Leicester" and Aasiya Bora for the Green Party.  Results will be counted on Friday.
</p><p>
<h4>Local elections</h4>
</p><p>
There are no scheduled local elections in Leicestershire or Rutland this year, but we do have three by-elections to bring you.  Two of them are defended by Labour including <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/iv4x">Loughborough East</a>, which is the first part of town travellers arriving at the railway station will see.  This column visited the predecessor ward of Loughborough Hastings in 2013 and 2017.  Loughborough is the main town in the Charnwood local government district where the Conservatives lost control last year and Labour are running a minority administration as the second-largest group; the town's East ward is safe for Labour.  Their defending candidate Louise Taylor-Durrant takes on last year's distant runner-up Daisy Taylor of the Greens and Pauline Ranson of the Conservatives.
</p><p>
To the west of Loughborough, Labour are also defending the <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i36r">Snibston South</a> ward of North West Leicestershire district, where we have the opposite situation to Charnwood on the council: Labour are the largest party, but a coalition of the Conservatives, Lib Dems and independents is in control.  Snibston is an old colliery village which became swallowed up by the growth of the town of Coalville, and Snibston South is effectively Coalville's south-western ward.  The ward became safe Labour in 2023, and new Labour candidate Catherine Beck will seek to defend the seat against Lib Dem Paul Holliday, independent Dan Roberts and the Greens' Greg Simpson.  The Conservatives will soon be looking to wrestle back the local parliamentary seat from expelled MP Andrew Bridgen, but surprisingly there is no Conservative candidate in this by-election.
</p><p>
The Conservatives have found a candidate for the seat they are defending in Leicestershire county council's <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/ibet">Burbage</a> division, which is effectively the southern end of the town of Hinckley although Burbage is still a separate parish from Hinckley.  This is a marginal division which the Tories will be looking to defend from the Lib Dems; in the 2023 elections to Hinckley and Bosworth council the Burbage Sketchley and Stretton ward, which covers nearly all of this division, returned a full slate of Lib Dem councillors.  So the defending Conservative candidate Maddie Lee has a fight on her hands against the Lib Dems' Barry Walker, also standing are James Ross for Labour and Rhiannon Carter for the Green Party.

PCC Philip Seccombe's wife, Izzi Seccombe, has served since 2013 as the leader of Warwickshire county council.  That's not up for election this year, but we can bring you elections for the whole of Nuneaton and Bedworth council and for one-third of Rugby council; both of these will count on Friday.
</p><p>
<b>Nuneaton and Bedworth</b> is all-up on new ward boundaries this year.  This Red Wall district has a large Conservative majority with 27 seats against 5 Labour and 2 Greens; and it definitely helps in this regard that Nuneaton and Bedworth is one of the few English districts that re-elects half of its councillors every two years, so there were no elections here in 2023 when Conservative councillors in other councils were falling like ninepins.  In local elections this is a very swingy district: when one party wins, it tends to win big.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/rugby21.png" alt="Rugby, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
In <b>Rugby</b> the Conservatives lost their council majority last year and have since fallen into a minority after losing a by-election to the Lib Dems in December.  The current council has 20 Conservative councillors, 12 Labour and 10 Lib Dems.  A repeat of last year's results would see Labour gain three seats from the Conservatives, which would still leave the Tories as the largest party but could render their minority administration untenable.
</p><p>
We also return to Warwick district for the third by-election in four years in <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/isdv">Leamington Clarendon</a> ward, which covers all of Leamington Spa town centre: the Parade, the Pump Rooms, the Regent (once Europe's largest hotel, now a Travelodge with very large rooms), they're all here.  This is a safe Labour ward; defending candidate Helen Adkins is top of the ballot paper against the Greens' Amanda Dyakov-Richmond, the Lib Dems' John Kelly, the Conservatives' Moira-Ann Grainger and Gerald Smith for UKIP.
</p><p>
<h2>West Midlands</h2>
</p><p>
<h4>Mayor</h4>
</p><p>
Now we come to our last mayoral contest of the year and one of the most high-profile contests this May: the West Midlands mayoralty.  This has been held since its establishment in 2017 by Andy Street, who is one of the most moderate figures in the current iteration of the Conservative Party.  Perhaps it helps in this regard that Street made his name not as a politician but as a businessman - he was managing director of the John Lewis Partnership before his election - and that in office he has very much kept his distance from the wilder antics of the party.
</p><p>
Street has certainly outperformed the Conservative brand across what would normally be a strongly Labour county.  Even in the 2019 general election Labour won the most parliamentary seats in the West Midlands, 14 to the Conservatives' 13.  So Andy Street can take a lot of personal credit from his re-election in 2021 with a 49-40 lead over the Labour candidate, Birmingham MP Liam Byrne.
</p><p>
After coming close to resigning over the cancellation of High Speed 2 phase 2, Street is now seeking a third term of office as mayor.  Labour have changed tactics after putting up two Birmingham MPs in the last two mayoral elections without success.  Their candidate this time is Richard Parker, a Bengal tiger who was left drifting in the ocean on a lifeboat in the 2001 Yann Martel novel <em>Life of Pi</em> (checks notes) - sorry, this Richard Parker is a former accountant who runs a business "working with SMEs and social enterprises on green investment, housing initiatives and the Birmingham Commonwealth Games".  Opinion polls during the campaign suggest we are in for a close result, with two polls having Parker ahead and one with Street leading.  Also standing are Siobhan Harper-Nunes for the Green Party, Sunny Virk for the Lib Dems, Elaine Williams for Reform UK and Gallowayite independent Akhmed Yakoob.
</p><p>
<h4>Police and Crime Commissioner</h4>
</p><p>
One thing which the new mayor of the West Midlands will <em>not</em> be responsible for is West Midlands Police.  That's not for want of trying.  Andy Street has for some years been trying to merge the mayor and PCC positions, as is being done in South Yorkshire this year; but he had been stymied by opposition from the West Midlands Combined Authority, made up of himself and council leaders from the area, which decided in 2019 not to bring a merger proposal forward.  The police and crime commissioner himself was also against the idea of a merger - and it didn't help that the mayor and PCC were from different parties.  The West Midlands police and crime commissioner, Simon Foster, is a Labour politician who was elected in 2021 with a 46-39 lead over the Conservatives, at the same time and on the same boundaries as Andy Street's re-election.  Foster's first-preference score of 276,743 votes was the highest for any PCC candidate in 2021, beating the 267,404 votes scored by the Conservatives in the Thames Valley police area into second place.
</p><p>
In October last year a change in the law removed the requirement for the combined authority to consent to a plan for merging the mayoral and PCC position.  Street now saw his chance, and he formally proposed a merger to the Home Secretary who has to sign off the paperwork for this change.  James Cleverly duly wrote to the PCC and the mayor on 6th December 2023 indicating that he would draw up  the appropriate legal order under section 107F of the Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act 2009 and lay it before Parliament for approval.
</p><p>
However, Street and the Home Secretary had been caught out by another change in the law made in October: orders under section 107F are now subject to section 113 of the 2009 Act, which says that the Secretary of State can make such an order only if three conditions are satisfied.  First, the Secretary of State must consider that to do so is likely to improve the economic, social, and environmental well-being of some or all of the people who live or work in the area; second, the Secretary of State must consider that to do is appropriate having regard to the need to secure effective and convenient local government, and to reflect the identities and interests of local communities; and finally, a public consultation has to be carried out.
</p><p>
PCC Foster's solicitors wrote to the Home Secretary pointing all this out, and as a result a public consultation was rather hastily set up which closed at the end of Janaury.  Having considered the submissions, the Home Secretary made a decision on 6th February to merge the Mayor and PCC for the West Midlands.  A draft statutory instrument was drawn up to effect this.
</p><p>
Simon Foster now took the Home Secretary to judicial review.  On 18th March the High Court ruled that the public consultation was inadequate: the consultation document had not given the public enough information to allow for a fair opportunity to participate with the consultation.  Mr Justice Swift accordingly quashed the merger decision.  With only eight days left before notice of election had to be given, the Home Secretary immediately appealed the decision; the Court of Appeal heard the case within the week, but on 22nd March they upheld the High Court's decision.  Notice of election was duly published on 26th March.
</p><p>
So we have a PCC election as well as a mayoral election.  A hastily-assembled candidate list sees a straight fight between the Conservatives and Labour: Simon Foster is seeking re-election from the red corner, former West Midlands policeman Tom Byrne challenges from the blue corner.  Counting for both this and the mayoral election will be on Saturday.
</p><p>
<h4>Local elections</h4>
</p><p>
The mayoral and PCC elections are combined with elections for the whole of Dudley council on new ward boundaries, and for one-third of the councillors in Coventry, Sandwell, Solihull, Walsall and Wolverhampton.  All of these will count on Friday.  There is also a by-election to cash-strapped Birmingham city council, whose next ordinary elections are due in 2026.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/dudley21.png" alt="Dudley, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
<b>Dudley</b> will definitely be one to watch.  The ward boundary changes are minimal so I've given a map of the current wards above; the council currently has a Conservative majority with 41 seats against 26 for Labour, 4 independents and a recent Lib Dem by-election winner.  As can be seen from the map above, 21 Conservative councillors - more than half of the group - were elected in the landslide year of 2021; the two years since then have not been like that, with the ward count being 12-all in both 2022 and 2023.  On that basis we can expect a close result here this time.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/walsall21.png" alt="Walsall, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
The other Black Country council run by the Conservatives is <b>Walsall</b>, where the local Labour party has been an unholy mess for decades.  The latest loony left antics here involve the Labour group splitting down the middle last November, which left the council at 37 Conservatives, 12 Labour, 7 for the Labour splinter group (which includes the former Labour group leader) and four independents.  Even in 2023 the Conservatives led the ward count here 13-7, and accordingly this column's par score is for the Conservatives to increase their majority in Walsall by gaining Blakenall ward from an independent councillor.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/solihull21.png" alt="Solihull, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Walsall now has a larger Conservative majority than the traditional middle-class enclave of <b>Solihull</b>.  The latest composition here has 29 Conservatives against 12 Greens, 6 Lib Dems and four independents; the par score here is for the Conservatives to lose two seats nett, with a gain from the Greens in Kingshurst and Fordbridge offset by three losses to the Lib Dems.
</p><p>
The Labour majorities in Wolverhampton, Sandwell and Coventry are not under threat.
</p><p>
In Birmingham there is a by-election to note in <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/izft">Bournbrook and Selly Park</a> ward, which lies immediately south of the Birmingham University campus and is around 64% student according to the 2021 census return.  This poll could be classed as a knock-on effect of the city's bankruptcy, because the outgoing councillor is Labour's Brigid Jones who was previously the cabinet member responsible for finance.  She leaves behind a safe Labour ward for defending candidate Jamie Scott, who takes on the Greens' Carla Charles, the Conservatives' Andrew Hardie, the Lib Dems' Joe Norris, independent Pete Bloomer, Corinthia Ward for the Socialist Alternative and Ed Woollard for the Workers Party of Britain.
</p><p>
<h2>Staffordshire</h2>
</p><p>
<h4>Police and Crime Commissioner</h4>
</p><p>
Staffordshire has often been a happy hunting ground for Conservative election candidates in recent years, and that extended to the 2021 PCC election.  Conservative PCC Ben (as in Benedict) Adams was elected in 2021 with a large majority of 57-28 over the Labour candidate.  Adams is seeking another term of office, and he is opposed by Labour candidate Alastair Watson (the Stoke-on-Trent cabinet member for finance) and Lib Dem Alec Sandiford.
</p><p>
<h4>Local elections</h4>
</p><p>
There are local elections this year for the whole of Cannock Chase council on new ward boundaries, and for one-third of Tamworth council.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/cannock-chase21.png" alt="Cannock Chase, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Similarly to Dudley above, <b>Cannock Chase</b> saw a Conservative landslide in 2021.  However, this is generally a stronger Labour area than Dudley when local election time comes around, and by-election losses meant that the Tory majority had disappeared going into the 2023 election - where Labour went on to gain five seats and formed a coalition administration with the Green Party and a Lib Dem councillor.  The Lib Dem subsequently went on to defect to Labour, meaning that the council composition is now 18 Labour, 18 Conservatives and 5 Greens.  Labour can expect to take overall control here.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/tamworth21.png" alt="Tamworth, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
In <b>Tamworth</b> the Conservatives fell into a minority at the May 2023 election: the current composition has 14 Conservative councillors, 9 Labour and 7 independents.  The problem the Conservatives face is immediately apparent from the map: in 2021, the seats which are up for re-election now, they won all ten wards.  Now, it's not quite the case that the opposition have literally nothing to lose - three of the Conservative councillors up for re-election have gone independent - but the Tories are clearly in deep trouble here.
</p><p>
This is only reinforced by looking at the results of the Tamworth parliamentary by-election which Labour gained from the Conservatives last October.  The Tamworth constituency also includes some rural and strongly Conservative wards of Lichfield district, so Labour clearly had a big lead in the town in the by-election.  Taking all the 2023 results into account, this column sets a very high par score: expect Labour to gain eight seats and an overall majority on Tamworth council.
</p><p>
All of the above Staffordshire results will come through on Friday.  There is also a by-election to Stoke-on-Trent council in the <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i21x">Meir North</a> ward: this lies on the eastern edge of Stoke's built-up area just to the north of the A50 dual carriageway towards Derby, which burrows under the Meir Crossroads in a tunnel.  Stoke-on-Trent has a full slate of Conservative MPs, and Stoke South (which includes this ward) has its Conservative majority greatly increased by the boundary changes which will shortly expand the seat outside the city; however, the city council was gained by Labour in 2023 and Meir North is safely part of the Labour majority.   Defending Labour candidate Lauren Davison takes on last year's runner-up Michelle Swift of the City Independents and Khawar Ali for the Conservatives.
</p><p>
<h2>West Mercia</h2>
</p><p>
<h4>Police and Crime Commissioner</h4>
</p><p>
The West Mercia police area covers three counties in the Severn and Wye valleys along the beautiful Welsh Marches: Shropshire, Herefordshire and Worcestershire.  Shropshire is geographically large but sparsely populated, and its population was clearly below the threshold for a police force of its own when the current county-based police structure was set up in 1974.  Herefordshire had been merged with Worcestershire into a single county by that local government reform, but if it was still separate no doubt the same considerations would have applied.
</p><p>
This is normally a strongly Conservative area of the country, and the 2021 PCC election was a case in point: the Tories' John-Paul Campion finished top of the poll with a 55-24 lead over Labour.  Campion is seeking another term.  The Labour candidate is Richard Overton, who is the deputy leader of Telford and Wrekin council.  Also standing are Sarah Murray for the Lib Dems, Henry Curteis for the English Democrats and Julian Dean for the Green Party.  Results are expected on Friday.
</p><p>
<h4>Local elections</h4>
</p><p>
There are local elections this year for the whole of Redditch and Worcester councils on new ward boundaries.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/redditch21.png" alt="Redditch, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
<b>Redditch</b>, which counts overnight, is rather similar to Tamworth which we just discussed in that it's a town transformed by Birmingham overspill: the main difference is that Redditch is officially a New Town, whereas Tamworth just looks like one.  And, as in Tamworth, the Conservatives swept every seat up for election here in 2021.  Redditch Labour were staring wipeout in the face in 2022, but they have impressively bounced back with wins in the 2022 and 2023 local elections sharply cutting the Tory majority.  The latest composition has 16 Conservatives, 12 Labour and 1 Lib Dem.  In 2023 the ward count was 6-4 in Labour's favour with the two strongest Labour wards (Central and Lodge Park) not up for election, so again Labour are projected to take control here.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/worcester21.png" alt="Worcester, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
By contrast, the Worcester Conservatives have gone from an overall council majority to contemplating their own potential wipeout in just two years.  The Tories lost every seat they were defending in Worcester in the 2023 local elections, and went on to perform appallingly in subsequent county and city council by-elections in the traditionally-Conservative Warndon Parish wards last October.  The Tory party needs to get its act together, fast, if it wants to have councillors here for the next four years.  Worcester council is currently hung with 13 Labour councillors, 11 Greens, 7 Conservatives and 4 Lib Dems; some rather complicated governance arrangements mean that there is a Labour-Green coalition.  Worcester counts its votes on Friday.
</p><p>
There is also a by-election to Worcestershire county council in the <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/itgf">Evesham North West</a> division, which takes in the western half of Evesham town centre, some housing over the River Avon in the south of the town and the village of Hampton to the west.  It is a safely Conservative division and most of it is contained within the safe-Conservative Hampton ward of Wychavon council, but parts of the division are covered by the Green-voting Evesham South ward (which this column visited last August) or by Evesham North ward which in 2023 elected the only Labour member of Wychavon council.  Conservative county councillor Peter Griffiths died in December, so this by-election has taken quite a long time to put together; the Tories' Mark Goodge should be favoured to hold the seat against competition from Labour's David Tasker, the Lib Dems' Oliver Walker, independent candidates John Campbell-Muir and Peter Scurfield, and the Green Party's Stephen Squires.

<h2>Gloucestershire</h2>
</p><p>
<h4>Police and Crime Commissioner</h4>
</p><p>
The Conservatives gained the Gloucestershire PCC position in 2021.  Their candidate Chris Nelson had a big lead on first preferences with 41%, with second place hotly contested: the Lib Dems polled 19%, outgoing independent PCC Martin Surl was third with 18% and Labour finished on 16%.
</p><p>
Nelson is seeking re-election.  Former PCC Martin Surl is back for another go and this time he has the Liberal Democrat nomination.  Labour have selected Ashley Smith, who is also seeking re-election this year to Stroud council.  Independent Matthew Randolph completes the candidate list.
</p><p>
<h4>Local elections</h4>
</p><p>
There are elections this year for the whole of Cheltenham, Gloucester and Stroud councils.  New ward boundaries are coming in for <b>Cheltenham</b>, where the council has had a very large Lib Dem majority for many years.
</p><p>
The other two councils up for election haven't seen any local elections since 2021, which may have been particularly helpful for the Conservatives in <b>Gloucester</b>.  This is now the only Conservative-run district in Gloucestershire: the 2021 elections returned 26 Conservative councillors, 10 Lib Dems and 3 Labour, but by-election and defection gains for the Lib Dems mean the Tory lead is now down to 21-14.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/stroud21.png" alt="Stroud, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
All of the above posts count on Friday, while the voters of <b>Stroud</b> will have to wait until Saturday to see who their new councillors are.  Stroud council, despite its rural nature, has always had a left-wing bent: the Stroud constituency has returned the Labour candidate to parliament a number of times over the years, and many years ago this was the first place where the Green Party became a serious electoral force.  The 2021 Stroud elections returned a hung council with an anti-Conservative majority: 20 Conservatives, 15 Labour, 13 Greens and 3 Lib Dems.  The Labour group has since fallen apart so badly that there are now only four Labour councillors left, and the Green Party are now leading a coalition administration which includes two Labour splinter groups.
</p><p>
<h2>Avon and Somerset</h2>
</p><p>
<h4>Police and Crime Commissioner</h4>
</p><p>
The first two PCC elections for Avon and Somerset returned independent candidate Sue Mountstevens, who didn't seek a third term in 2021.  A rather fragmented picture on first preferences saw the Conservatives lead with 35%, against 24% for Labour, 16% for the Green Party and 13% for the Liberal Democrats.  The Conservative candidate Mark Shelford went on to win the runoff against Labour narrowly.  He is seeking re-election against opposition from Labour's Clare Moody, who was an MEP for the South West from 2014 to 2019, the Greens' Katy Grant who is also seeking re-election to Bristol council, and the Lib Dems' Benet Allen who used to be deputy leader of the abolished Somerset West and Taunton council and who previously appeared in this column in a February 2018 by-election for Minehead South.  This result will be counted overnight.
</p><p>
<h4>Local elections</h4>
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/bristol21.png" alt="Bristol, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
The only local authority in Avon and Somerset holding elections this year is <b>Bristol</b> city council, which has abolished its elected mayoralty and sent control back to the council.  The city's outgoing Labour mayor Marvin Rees had won a second term comfortably in 2021, but he had a difficult council to work with: the simultaneous council elections returned 24 seats each for the Greens and Labour, 14 Conservatives and 8 Lib Dems.  There have been no local elections here since, but by-election results in the city over the last term have been very promising for the Green Party.  Results here will come through on Friday.  Win or lose, the Greens' Filwood ward candidate Danica Priest has been left with a permanent reminder of this campaign after having one of her fingers partly bitten off by a dog.
</p><p>
Another interesting recent by-election result in the Bristol area is the Labour gain of the Kingswood parliamentary seat from the Conservatives in February.  The Kingswood constituency includes South Gloucestershire's <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/izqu">New Cheltenham</a> ward, which covers housing in northern Kingswood town on the eastern edge of Bristol's built-up area.  This was close between Labour and the Conservatives in 2019 but now looks safe for Labour, and the defending Labour candidate Angela Morey is favoured against the Conservatives' Kelly Cole, the Lib Dems' James Corrigan and the Greens' AJ Coakham.
</p><p>
In the Somerset half of the Avon and Somerset police area, we have a by-election to Somerset council for the <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i1wx">Mendip South</a> division, which covers the countryside between Shepton Mallet, Glastonbury, Somerton and Castle Cary.  This division includes the sprawling site at Worthy Farm, between the villages of Pilton and East Pennard, which hosts the Glastonbury Festival most summers.
</p><p>
Most of Mendip South division went to the polls last July in the Somerton and Frome parliamentary by-election, and the villages of Butleigh and Baltonsborough are having their third by-election in as many years after polling in October 2022 for the last election to the now-abolished Mendip council.  That Butleigh and Baltonsborough poll was won by the former Somerset county council leader Ken Maddock, who beat the Lib Dems by just four votes; his Mendip council seat then disappeared six months later.  Mendip South was marginal when it was last contested in 2022, with the Lib Dem slate prevailing by 53-47; Rob Reed defends for the Lib Dems, Ken Maddock will try to make another political comeback for the Conservatives, and there is more choice for the electors this time with interventions from Labour's David Oakensen and the Greens' Michael Smyth.
</p><p>
<h2>Wiltshire</h2>
</p><p>
<h4>Police and Crime Commissioner</h4>
</p><p>
The Wiltshire PCC election of May 2021 was, in terms of the number of voters inconvenienced, the biggest electoral mess of that year.  It was won easily by the new Conservative candidate Jonathan Seed, who polled 41% of the vote against 17% each for the Lib Dems and Labour and 15% for independent candidate Mike Rees.
</p><p>
However, at the time of polling it was not widely known that Seed was disqualified from being a police and crime commissioner due to his criminal record.  He had spent convictions from 1993 for drink-driving and failure to stop at the scene of an accident, for which he was fined £500 and disqualified from driving for 18 months by Kennet magistrates.  The maximum penalty for those offences is now six months' imprisonment and an unlimited fine, and these were also imprisonable offences in 1993.  Which meant Seed was ineligible to be a police and crime commissioner: being convicted of any imprisonable offence is a disqualification for that post, whether you actually went to prison or not.
</p><p>
Full marks are due to the investigative team at ITV News for digging up Seed's past, but they didn't get the story out until the interval between polls closing and the votes being counted.  By the time Seed had been declared as the winner by the returning officer, it was clear that he could not take up the post of PCC.  The job was declared vacant when he failed to sign his declaration of acceptance of office within the two-month deadline after the poll.  Jonathan Seed was subsequently charged with making a false statement (that he was not disqualified from office) on his nomination papers; he pleaded not guilty at Oxford Crown Court in November 2021, and the charge was subsequently dropped due to insufficient evidence.
</p><p>
The by-election resulting from all this took place at the awkward time of mid-August 2021, and on the predictable awful turnout the Conservatives' Philip Wilkinson became Wiltshire PCC with 36% of the vote, against 28% for independent Mike Rees and 20% for the Lib Dems.
</p><p>
Philip Wilkinson is seeking a second term of office for the Conservatives.  Mike Rees is also having another go after his second-place finish last time; he spent 30 years in Wiltshire police before starting a second career in business a decade ago.  The Lib Dem candidate Alan Hagger is an Amesbury town councillor who has previously worked for three PCCs in Hampshire.  Labour's Stanka Adamcova completes the Wiltshire PCC ballot, which will not be counted until Saturday.

<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/swindon21.png" alt="Swindon, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
There are elections this year for one-third of <b>Swindon</b> council, which Labour impressively gained from the Conservatives last year.  On that occasion the Conservatives lost 10 seats, including that of the council leader David Renard; this time round could be even worse for the Tories, as 15 of their councillors - nearly two-thirds of the council group - are up for election.  The current council composition is 32 Labour, 23 Conservatives, 1 Lib Dem and 1 vacancy, which includes a Conservative by-election gain from Labour last July in St Margaret and South Marston ward; despite this, the expectation has to be that Labour will massively increase its council majority here.  Results here will come through on Friday.
</p><p>
<h2>Dorset</h2>
</p><p>
<h4>Police and Crime Commissioner</h4>
</p><p>
The Dorset PCC position was won by independent Martin Underhill in 2012 and 2016.  He retired in 2021 and the open seat went to the Conservative candidate David Sidwick, who polled 43% of the vote against 21% for independent candidate Dan Hardy and 14% for the Green Party.  Sidwick is now seeking a second term of office against rather different opposition, as neither Hardy nor the Greens are standing this year.  There is however a new independent, Marianne Storey, who used to run a mental health charity in the county and who is endorsed by former PCC Underhill.  Also standing are Howard Legg for the Liberal Democrats and David Stokes for Labour.  The Dorset PCC votes will be counted on Saturday.
</p><p>
<h4>Local elections</h4>
</p><p>
There are elections this year for the whole of Dorset council, which covers everything in the county outside Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole.  Dorset has an unusual electoral cycle at the moment.   Although it's not technically a county council, its elections are transitioning onto the county council electoral cycle over a 10-year period: so the councillors up for election here are coming off a five-year term and the winners will serve another five-year term to 2029.  This means that Dorset is the last remaining UK council whose members were last elected in the Theresa May era - that's three prime ministers ago.

</p><p>
The 2019 <b>Dorset</b> council elections returned a Conservative majority, but not a particularly large one: 43 councillors against 29 Lib Dems, 4 Greens, 4 independents and 2 Labour.  By-election results since then have seen the Conservatives lose a seat in Lyme Regis to the Green Party.  May 2019 was a poor election for the Conservatives generally, but given everything that has happened since in the South West the Lib Dems may well fancy their chances of gaining overall control here after the votes are counted on Friday.
</p><p>
Mention of Dorset brings us back to a story this column covered in January concerning a by-election in the Littlemoor and Preston ward of Weymouth.  The Conservatives selected as their defending candidate for that by-election Peter Dickenson, and he went on to win.  Which was a problem, because at the time he worked for the council as a lollipop man.  I wrote at the time:
</p><p>
<blockquote>
</p><p>
The problem with this is that Dickenson's employer is Dorset council - which means he's not eligible to be a Dorset councillor.  Local government law says you can't stand for election to a council you're drawing a wage from.  Unfortunately, by the time this was realised it was too late to take Dickenson off the ballot paper and he has gone forward to the election as the official Conservative candidate.
</p><p>
If Dickenson wins this by-election, then he will be unable to take up his seat, Dorset council will remain a man down until May, the returning officer will have spent a five-figure sum in council taxpayers' money organising this by-election with nothing to show for it, and Dorset Police (who have already received a complaint about the matter) will have to investigate why Dickenson signed the declaration on his nomination papers that he was not disqualified from office.  Lying about that is electoral fraud, and in November last year Councillors Behaving Badly favourite Jeff Milburn of South Tyneside (<em>Andrew's Previews 2021</em>, page 358) was sent to prison for ten months for falsely making that declaration.
</p><p>
</blockquote>
</p><p>
I was criticised at the time for apparently calling for the imprisonment of a popular local lollipop man.  For the avoidance of doubt, I felt at the time that Dickenson's conduct fell into the category of cockup rather than conspiracy; but what has happened since in this story is worrying.  Dickenson went on to resign his employment as a school crossing attendant, and he was then <em>sworn in</em> as a Dorset councillor on 1st March and is duly listed as such on the council website despite being returned in the January by-election while ineligible.  There was no council meeting for him to attend before May - April's full council was cancelled due to lack of business - and press reports indicated that Dickenson would not take his allowance before the May election, which is probably for the best on his part given that he is not legally a councillor and he should not be using or profiting from that title.  Peter Dickenson is standing again this May, and this time he <em>is</em> eligible to do so; but the electors of Littlemoor and Preston ward may wish to consider whether this is the sort of person they want to represent them for the next five years.
</p><p>
The only other Dorset district is the urban Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole - unwieldy name, unwieldy council - which went to the polls last year on the usual four-year cycle.  That 2023 election was a Conservative bloodbath, and the Tories have another seat to defend in this by-election.  Luckily for them, it's in probably the safest Conservative ward left in the three towns: <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/iuhv">Canford Cliffs</a> ward covers the southern end of Poole and includes the notoriously expensive enclave of Sandbanks jutting out into Poole harbour.  The Conservatives' Gavin Wright should have little trouble being elected here; he is opposed by Ray Sparrow for the Lib Dems, Jim Buchanan for Labour and Johnny Tutton for the Green Party.
</p><p>
<h2>Devon and Cornwall</h2>
</p><p>
<h4>Police and Crime Commissioner</h4>
</p><p>
Our final PCC position in the south-west is Devon and Cornwall, which is in Conservative hands at present.  The current PCC Alison Hernandez polled 49.97% in 2021, finishing just a handful of votes away from being re-elected in the first round; second place went to Labour on 20%, with the Lib Dems on 18%.  Hernandez is seeking re-election for a third term of office; Labour have selected former diplomat Daniel Steel, while the Lib Dem candidate Steve Lodge runs a marketing and communications agency.  Results will come through on Friday.
</p><p>
<h4>Local elections</h4>
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/plymouth21.png" alt="Plymouth, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
There are elections this year for one-third of Plymouth and Exeter councils, both of which have Labour majorities and are counting overnight.  <b>Plymouth</b> was an impressive Labour gain last year, and with more than half of the remaining Conservative group up for election this year an immediate Tory comeback looks out of the question.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/exeter21.png" alt="Exeter, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
By contrast Labour are coming under pressure on their left flank in <b>Exeter</b>, which currently stands at 24 Labour seats (one of which is vacant) against 6 Greens, 4 Conservatives, 3 Lib Dems and 2 ex-Labour independents.  Both of the independents are up for re-election this year.  A repeat of 2023 would see Labour gain Topsham ward from the Conservatives and recover one defection loss in Pinhoe ward, but this would be offset by two losses to the Greens and one to the Lib Dems.
</p><p>
There are four council by-elections taking place in Devon, one of which is in the cursed West Devon ward of <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i6es">Tavistock North</a> which is having its third by-election in as many years, and its sixth of this century.  This ward returned three independent councillors in 2019; one of them resigned at the end of 2021 and the Conservatives won the resulting by-election in February 2022.
</p><p>
The May 2023 West Devon elections saw Tavistock North's three seats split three ways between re-elected independent councillor Jeff Moody, Lib Dem Pete Squire and the Green Party's Terry Wheeler.  Wheeler then resigned immediately, because his landlord had served a no-fault eviction notice on him during the campaign and he had been unable to find alternative accommodation in Tavistock.  The Greens finished third in the resulting June 2023 by-election but only by 18 votes in a close four-way race, with the Lib Dems' Holly Greenbury-Pullen and independent candidate Ursula Mann tying for first place on 233 votes each.  Mann won the returning officer's drawing of lots and was declared elected.
</p><p>
This Tavistock North by-election is defended by the Liberal Democrats following the resignation of Pete Squire.  The Lib Dem candidate is again Holly Greenbury-Pullen, who this time is defending the seat.  Independent candidate Michael Fife Cook, who was the runner-up here in May 2023, is back for another go; the Greens have changed candidate to Sara Wood; and Judy Hughes, who finished fourth in the June 2023 by-election, is back for the Conservatives.  Uwem Edo completes the ballot paper for Labour.
</p><p>
West Devon council is bracketed for parliamentary purposes with Torridge district, where the Green Party are defending <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/izcu">Bideford North</a> ward following the death in February of Peter Christie at the age of 73.  He was one of the longest-serving Green councillors in the country, having represented Bideford North ward on Torridge council continuously since 1991.  Even before that Christie was a Bideford town councillor, serving as mayor in 1985: he was the youngest-ever mayor of Bideford, and the UK's first ever Green Party mayor.
</p><p>
Peter Christie had a massive personal vote in Bideford North in which he was regularly the only Green candidate: in 2023 the ward's other two seats went to the Lib Dems and an independent candidate.  He'll be a hard act to follow for the defending Green candidate John Puddy, who is opposed by a long candidate list: Teresa Tinsley for the Lib Dems, independent candidates Ruth Craigie and Tony Inch, Tom Hammett for Labour, Morgan Taylor for the Conservatives and Nigel Johnson for Reform UK.
</p><p>
Another Devon town with an unusual mayoral distinction is Ashburton, which used to the be the political home of Alan "Howling Laud" Hope, the leader of the Official Monster Raving Loony Party.  Hope was an Ashburton town councillor before he moved to Hampshire, and he served two terms as mayor of the town.
</p><p>
Ashburton is bracketed for electoral purposes with Buckfastleigh, from where the monks of Buckfast Abbey contribute to the Christian peace of Scotland by brewing Buckfast Tonic Wine.  You've heard of the Coca-Cola Christmas truck tour; well, every December the equally eagerly-awaited Buckie Truck brings the neds of the Central Belt their coveted bottles of "Wreck the Hoose Juice", "Commotion Lotion", "Cumbernauld Rocket Fuel", "Coatbridge Table Wine" and "What the Hell Are You Looking At?".
</p><p>
<img src="https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13614357.ece/ALTERNATES/s810/46435012_2211441402512198_6449225069498466304_o.jpg" alt="Buckie Truck" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
And if you believe that, you'll believe anything.  <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/ifdu">Ashburton and Buckfastleigh</a> ward of Teignbridge council covers those two towns together with four other parishes.  Most of its area, including the two eponymous towns, lies within the Dartmoor National Park where the Official Monster Raving Loony Party used to hold regular events sliding down the Haytor butter mountain.
</p><p>
Sadly the OMRLP are now extinct here as a political force.  In both the 2019 and 2023 elections Ashburton and Buckfastleigh's three seats split two to the Lib Dems and one to the Conservatives.  The Lib Dems, who have a small majority on Teignbridge council, are defending this by-election following the death in January of councillor Huw Cox who was the serving mayor of Buckfastleigh.  Their defending candidate on another long ballot paper is Jack Major, who was a close runner-up in both 2019 and 2023; he is opposed by Richard Edlmann for the Conservatives, Sue Clarke for the South Devon Alliance (which already holds nine seats on Teignbridge council), Lisa Robillard Webb for Labour, independent candidate Michael Hext, Madeleine Hunt for the Heritage Party and Pauline Wynter for the Greens.
</p><p>
Our final Devon by-election comes in East Devon district, where the Conservatives are defending <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/ixmu">Exmouth Brixington</a> ward.  This is the north-eastern of Exmouth's five wards and it was a rare bright spot for the Tories in 2023, as they won all three seats in the ward including a gain from the Lib Dems.  The defending Conservative candidate is Aurora Bailey, who is opposed by Dianne Conduit for the Lib Dems, Julie Bennett for Labour and Michael Rosser for the Greens.

<h2>Norfolk</h2>
</p><p>
<h4>Police and Crime Commissioner</h4>
</p><p>
Our tour of England now crosses to East Anglia where we start by considering the election for Norfolk police and crime commissioner.  This was an easy hold for the Conservatives in 2021, although the wonderfully-named Giles Orpen-Smellie was taken to transfers: he polled 45% in the first round against 22% for Labour and 14% for the Liberal Democrats.  Orpen-Smellie is seeking a second term; the Labour candidate is Sarah Taylor who is a district councillor in Dereham and is described as a national expert in road safety; the Lib Dem candidate John Crofts is a retired headteacher who won a county council by-election in Freebridge Lynn division last year; and also standing is Martin Schmierer for the Greens.  Votes here will be counted on Friday.
</p><p>
<h4>Local elections</h4>
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/norwich21.png" alt="Norwich, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
The only Norfolk council which retains thirds elections is the city of <b>Norwich</b>, whose boundary really does look like that: the city council is also the port authority for the Port of Norwich, and as such the council controls the navigable River Yare downstream as far as Hardley Cross.  Norwich has recently fallen into No Overall Control as a result of a split in the ruling Labour group; the latest composition has 19 Labour councillors, 13 Greens, 4 councillors in the splinter group and 3 Lib Dems.  Two of the defectors are up for re-election this year, but Labour will need to do better than 2023 - when the Greens gained Sewell and Wensum wards - to get their majority back.  Norwich's ward results won't come out until Saturday.
</p><p>
There are two by-elections taking place in rural Norfolk, both in wards which have appeared in this column fairly recently.  The <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i7bu">Bunwell</a> ward of South Norfolk goes to the polls following the recent death of Conservative councillor Stephen Ridley, who had served the ward since 2019 and was re-elected for a second term in 2023 with a large majority.  So on paper the new Tory candidate Charles Easton should be favoured.  However, this ward is part of the West Depwade county council division which was gained by former Green Party MEP Catherine Rowett at a by-election last July, and the ward will form part of the new Waveney Valley parliamentary seat where the local Greens fancy their chances.  This could be one to watch.  Opposing the Conservatives here are Mike Crouch for Labour, Trevor Wenman for the Lib Dems and Suzanne Wateridge for the Green Party.
</p><p>
In the west of the county we return to Breckland council's <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i98r">Hermitage</a> ward, which covers a number of villages between Dereham and Fakenham.  This ward featured in this column in December 2021, when the Conservatives held off a Lib Dem challenge in a previously-safe ward by just 22 votes; the Liberal Democrats went on to gain the ward by 19 votes at the 2023 Breckland council elections.  A year later, this ward is clearly going to be closely fought again between the defending Lib Dem Ian Minto and the Conservative challenger Robin Hunter-Clarke; the only other candidate on this ballot is Joe Sisto for Labour.
</p><p>
<h2>Suffolk</h2>
</p><p>
<h4>Police and Crime Commissioner</h4>
</p><p>
In the 2021 Suffolk PCC election the Conservatives' Tim Passmore was re-elected in the first round for his third term of office, enjoying a 55-23 lead over Labour.
</p><p>
Tim Passmore is one of two remaining police and crime commissioners who have been in post continuously since the inaugural PCC elections with the comedy turnouts in November 2012 and who are seeking re-election for a fourth term; the other is Katy Bourne in Sussex.  Up against him is another political veteran: the Labour candidate Sir Robin Wales was the directly-elected mayor of Newham in east London from 2002 to 2018, and he was a Newham councillor before then as far back as 1982.  Rachel Smith-Lyte for the Green Party and James Sandbach for the Liberal Democrats also stand.  Counting for Suffolk PCC will take place on Friday.
</p><p>
<h4>Local elections</h4>
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/ipswich21.png" alt="Ipswich, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
There are elections this year for one-third of <b>Ipswich</b> council, which has had a secure Labour majority for many years.  The current composition has 31 Labour councillors, 9 Conservatives, 3 Lib Dems and 3 independents, so more than half of the Conservative group is up for election this year.  Ipswich will count overnight.
</p><p>
A little bit of history is made here as we have the first by-election to a Green-majority council.  This isn't Brighton or Bristol or anywhere full of urban professionals: it's the rural Mid Suffolk district, where many years of Green growth culminated in a gain of overall control last year.  In this by-election the ruling Greens are defending <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/iwfv">Chilton</a> ward, which is the western of the four wards covering the town of Stowmarket.  In 2023 the Green Party were guaranteed a seat in this ward because their two-man slate was opposed only by a single Conservative candidate, who lost badly.  On previous form the defending Green candidate Lorraine Baker should have little to worry about; hoping to prove me wrong on that are Steven Runciman for the Conservatives and William Howman for Labour.
</p><p>
<h2>Cambridgeshire</h2>
</p><p>
<h4>Police and Crime Commissioner</h4>
</p><p>
Like the West Midlands, Cambridgeshire was a county which had mayoral and PCC elections in 2021 that were won by two different parties.  The Labour Mayor of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough, Nik Johnson, isn't due for re-election until next year.  Johnson came from behind to win on transfers, but the Conservative PCC for Cambridgeshire Darryl Preston didn't suffer that fate: Preston led on the first round with 43% against 31% for Labour and 23% for the Lib Dems, and he went on to win the runoff 53-47.  Darryl Preston is seeking a second term against opposition from Labour candidate Anna Smith, a Cambridge councillor (and former Cambridge council leader) who is currently Johnson's deputy mayor, and Liberal Democrat candidate Edna Murphy who is a county councillor for Bar Hill and chairs the county's fire authority.  Counting for the PCC position will take place on Friday.
</p><p>
<h4>Local elections</h4>
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/cambridge21.png" alt="Cambridge, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
There are elections this year for one-third of the councillors in the cities of Cambridge and Peterborough.  <b>Cambridge</b> has been under Labour control for some years, and the Labour majority currently stands at 25 out of 42; in opposition are 11 Lib Dems, 4 Greens, 1 Conservative and an ex-Labour independent.  A repeat of last May's results would see Labour lose Newnham ward to the Green Party with the Lib Dems confirming a by-election gain from an independent councillor in Queen Edith's ward, but we should also note the subsequent Conservative by-election gain in King's Hedges ward - an apparent reaction to now-dropped plans for a Cambridge congestion charge.  Results for Cambridge will come through on Friday.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/peterborough21.png" alt="Peterborough, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Local politics in <b>Peterborough</b> is confusing at the best of times, but there was a particularly confusing turn of events in the city last November when a long-standing Conservative minority administration was voted out of office; it was replaced by a rather unstable-looking minority administration run by the localist/independent group Peterborough First.  This group won only one seat in 2023 - in Werrington ward, which has long been in the hands of localist independents - but now has 10 out of 60 councillors.  In opposition are 22 Conservatives, 14 Labour, 8 Lib Dems, 3 independents and 2 Greens.
</p><p>
In 2021 the Conservatives won 16 out of 23 wards in Peterborough.  They are also defending a by-election gain from Labour in Park ward, but this is offset by three of their councillors walking off to join Peterborough First; so 14 of the 22 Conservative councillors are up for re-election this year.  That suggests we are on track for large Conservative losses.  A comparison with the 2023 results suggests that this would benefit the Lib Dems, Labour and the Greens in that order, but it will be interesting to see what sort of campaign Peterborough First put up.  We won't have too long to wait, because Peterborough will count its council votes overnight.
</p><p>
Huntingdonshire council has a non-standard electoral cycle and is not up this year, but we do have a by-election to report in <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i70t">Great Paxton</a> ward which covers a number of villages to the east of St Neots.  This is vacated by the Conservatives' Richard West, who saw his previously-safe seat turn marginal in 2022 as the Conservatives lost control of Huntingdonshire council.  New Conservative candidate Ari Laakkonen has a 9-point lead to defend over the Lib Dems, whose candidate is James Catmur; also standing are James Hughes for Labour and Catherine Goodman for the Green Party.
</p><p>
<h2>Essex</h2>
</p><p>
<h4>Police and Crime Commissioner</h4>
</p><p>
Essex is one of the few remaining bright spots for modern Conservatism, and this was reflected in a first-round win for the party in the 2021 PCC election.  Roger Hirst enjoyed a 54-23 lead over Labour then for his re-election.  If anything, this understates the Conservative position given that the English Democrats, who fish for votes in the same general area as the modern Conservative party, polled almost 10%.  Hirst is seeking re-election for a third term of office; the Labour candidate Adam Fox is a former leader of the Labour group on Colchester council; and also standing are Kieron Franks for the Lib Dems and Robin Tilbrook again for the English Democrats.  Results here are expected on Friday evening.
</p><p>
<h4>Local elections</h4>
</p><p>
There are elections this year for the whole of Basildon, Brentwood, Castle Point, Epping Forest and Harlow councils where new ward boundaries are being brought in, and also for one-third of Colchester, Rochford, Southend-on-Sea and Thurrock councils.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/harlow21.png" alt="Harlow, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
One of the few places where the Conservatives made net gains in the 2023 local elections was <b>Harlow</b>, where the party now has a 21-12 lead over Labour.  Harlow gets new ward boundaries this year, and on the old lines Labour actually won the ward count here 6-5 last year.  In an even year the Conservatives are disadvantaged in Harlow council elections by having most of their voters packed into very safe wards like Church Langley; that's split into two new wards this year which might help the Conservatives a bit, but a repeat of 2023 would clearly still give a very close result.
</p><p>
The Church Langley area is also the basis for the <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/inzd">Harlow South East</a> division of Essex county council, where veteran county and borough councillor Eddie Johnson is retiring.  The defending Conservative candidate here is his son Andrew Johnson, the chair of Harlow council, who has himself been a borough councillor since 1998; he led the town's Conservative group for many years, served three terms as leader of the council, and now has a good chance to double up at county level.  Johnson is top of a ballot paper which also includes Kay Morrison for Labour, Christopher Millington for the Lib Dems, Dan Long for UKIP and Jennifer Steadman for the Greens.  The Harlow South East county council by-election will be counted on Friday afternoon, but the Harlow council results will come out overnight.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/brentwood21.png" alt="Brentwood, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
The Harlow borough is surrounded on its Essex side by <b>Epping Forest</b> district, which is safely Conservative: the latest composition has 34 Conservatives, 13 councillors for the Loughton Residents Association, 5 Lib Dems, 4 independents and two Greens.  There are new boundaries here and also further along the M25 in <b>Brentwood</b>, at the eastern end of the Elizabeth Line; here the Conservatives lost control in 2023.  Brentwood council is currently finely balanced, with 18 Conservative councillors, 17 Lib Dems and two Labour councillors holding the balance of power: they have formed a coalition with the Lib Dems.  The Liberal Democrats performed well across the district in 2023, and a repeat of that should deliver a council majority for them.  Both Epping Forest and Brentwood will count their votes on Friday.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/thurrock21.png" alt="Thurrock, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
The financial chickens came home to roost some time ago at <b>Thurrock</b>, which is moving to whole-council elections next year by government diktat.  The Conservative majority here has recently disappeared thanks to defections to independents: this has left the Tory administration in a minority with 23 councillors against 19 Labour and 7 independents.   Labour performed well here in 2023, after the full horror of the council's bankruptcy became apparent; a repeat of those results would deliver five Labour gains, which would leave that party one seat short of an overall majority.  There is an overnight count here.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/basildon21.png" alt="Basildon, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
There were several Essex councils apart from Harlow where the Conservatives made net gains in 2023, which partly reflects some polling-based analysis that the Tory vote is holding up relatively well here and partly reflects some unusually poor local election results for the Essex Conservatives in 2019.  One of those was <b>Basildon</b>.  Like Harlow, Basildon is a New Town; like Harlow, it has new ward boundaries this year; like Harlow, a repeat of the 2023 results would deliver a council which is rather closer between the Conservatives and the Labour than the current one (24 Conservatives plus 2 vacancies, 9 Labour and 7 independents).  Basildon counts its votes on Friday.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/southend21.png" alt="Southend-on-Sea, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
The Conservatives gained minority control of <b>Southend-on-Sea</b> last year, after a net gain of one seat delivered a council of 22 Conservatives, 16 Labour, 8 independents of various stripes, 4 Lib Dems and a Green councillor.  This time the Conservatives have a much more difficult map to defend, and they stand to lose six seats (three to Labour, two to independents and one to the Lib Dems) if the 2023 results are repeated.  There will be an overnight count here.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/castle-point21.png" alt="Castle Point, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
In between Basildon and Southend we find the curiously-named <b>Castle Point</b> district, combining Benfleet and nearby towns on the mainland with Canvey Island in the Thames estuary.  This is in the joint hands of two independent slates: the Canvey Island Independent Party, which has had a lock on elections on the island for many years, and a newer group which has taken the mainland wards by storm in recent years.  Between them, those two independent groups control 33 seats on the council against eight Conservatives.  Castle Point may be coming up in national MRP-based polling models as one of the safest Conservative seats around in general elections, but local elections are a different matter - and the Tory cause here will not be helped by a large number of their intending candidates having their nominations rejected due to paperwork issues.  Hopefully we will not see further paperwork issues affecting the count once that gets underway on Friday.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/rochford21.png" alt="Rochford, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
To the north of Southend we have a very messy situation in <b>Rochford</b> council, where the largest single group is the Conservatives with 12 councillors; however, they are shut out of power by a coalition of the Rochford District Residents (7 councillors), the Liberal Democrats (9), independent Greens (4), official Greens (1) and the Rochford District Independents (3).  There are also two Independent Conservatives and an ungrouped councillor.  All this doesn't bear much relation to recent election results in the borough, and the extent of the defections here makes it very difficult to make any prediction other than that Rochford council should remain hung after these elections.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/colchester21.png" alt="Colchester, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Rochford will count overnight as will our last Essex borough, <b>Colchester</b>, where we have another messy hung council.  A traffic-light coalition broke down after last year's elections and the Lib Dems run the city as a minority.  They are currently the second-largest party on the council with 16 seats, against 19 Conservatives, 13 Labour councillors plus a vacant seat, and 2 Greens.  A repeat of the 2023 results would see the Lib Dems gain Stanway ward from the Conservatives.
</p><p>
<h2>Hertfordshire</h2>
</p><p>
<h4>Police and Crime Commissioner</h4>
</p><p>
The 2021 Hertfordshire PCC election saw the Conservatives' David Lloyd re-elected.  He was just short of a first-round win, polling 49% in the first round against 27% for Labour and 24% for the Lib Dems.
</p><p>
Lloyd is retiring after 12 years in post, and the new Conservative candidate is Jonathan Ash-Edwards who was formerly a long-serving member of Mid Sussex council; he was that council's leader for four years until he lost his seat in 2023.  Labour and the Liberal Democrats have both selected North Hertfordshire councillors who represent wards in Letchworth: the Labour candidate Tom Plater is a musician by trade, wihle the Lib Dems' Sean Prendergast is an investigator for the Housing Ombudsman Service.  The Green Party's Matt Fisher completes the Hertfordshire PCC ballot, for which votes will not be counted until Saturday.
</p><p>
<h4>Local elections</h4>
</p><p>
There are elections this year for the whole of North Hertfordshire council which is moving off the thirds electoral cycle, the whole of Stevenage council on new ward boundaries, and for one-third of councillors in Broxbourne, St Albans, Three Rivers, Watford and Welwyn Hatfield.  Broxbourne council will count its votes overnight, the others on Friday.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2014/three-rivers14.png" alt="Three Rivers, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Most of these districts are safe for one party or another.  Broxbourne has an impregnable Conservative majority, Stevenage is safe for Labour, and Watford's Lib Dem elected mayor isn't up for election this year.  <b>Three Rivers</b> council looks marginal on paper but in practice most of its wards are safe, with a Lib Dem majority group of 21 councillors facing 12 Conservatives, 3 Labour, 2 Greens and an ex-Lib Dem independent who is up for re-election this year.  If the Lib Dems get the defector's seat back, that may be offset by losing their last seat in Dickinsons ward to the Green Party.  There is a whole-council election in North Hertfordshire: this is a hung council, with Labour (19) and the Lib Dems (15) in coalition - both of those parties performed very well in last year's elections - and the Conservatives (15) in opposition.
</p><p>
<h2>Bedfordshire</h2>
</p><p>
<h4>Police and Crime Commissioner</h4>
</p><p>
This year's election for Bedfordshire PCC could be one to watch.  Bedfordshire surprisingly voted Labour in the first PCC elections in 2012 on a comedy turnout, before being gained by the Conservatives in 2016.  The current incumbent is Festus Akinbusoye, whose position does not look safe on current polling: in 2021 Akinbusoye had 42% of the vote, against 35% for Labour and 13% for the Liberal Democrats.  Mind, he did do relatively well on transfers to win the runoff 54-46.
</p><p>
You can see why PCC Festus Akinbusoye tried to move on to greater things by standing as the Conservative candidate in the Mid Bedfordshire by-election last year, after Nadine Dorries flounced out of Parliament.  But instead of a safe seat on the green benches, he got the unwanted record of being the candidate who squandered the largest majority (in raw votes) ever overturned in a parliamentary by-election.  At least the Conservative loss there spared me from having to write the PCC By-Election Rant again.
</p><p>
Akinbusoye is seeking a second term of office.  The Labour candidate John Tizard is seeking to return to elected office after a very long time away: he was a Bedfordshire county councillor from 1981 to 1999, and for 14 of those 18 years he led the county council's Labour group.  (Bedfordshire county council was abolished in 2009.)  The Lib Dems have reselected their 2021 candidate Jasbir Singh Parmar, who used to be a Bedford councillor and has also been a policeman in the past.  Completing the ballot paper is Waheed Akbar for the (Gallowayite) Workers Party.  Results here should come through on Friday.
</p><p>
<h4>Local elections</h4>
</p><p>
The only local election in Bedfordshire this year is a by-election in the <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i5sx">Riverfield</a> ward of Bedford council.  The river here is the Great Ouse, which runs through the middle of this ward; however, all the housing lies to the north of the river along Riverfield Drive.  Riverfield ward is a safe Lib Dem area which was created in 2023 from the eastern half of the former Newnham ward; that was gained by the Lib Dems in 2019, and their defending candidate in this by-election is former Newnham ward councillor Hilde Hendrickx.

<h2>Thames Valley</h2>
</p><p>
<h4>Police and Crime Commissioner</h4>
</p><p>
Like West Mercia, the Thames Valley police area covers three counties: in this case Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire and Berkshire.  These are traditionally strongly Conservative areas, and in 2021 the Conservative candidate Matthew Barber won easily with 42% of the vote against 28% for Labour and 18% for the Lib Dems.  It was a good way to continue a political career: Barber had previosuly been leader of Vale of White Horse council in Oxfordshire, which is now a Tory-free zone.
</p><p>
Matthew Barber is seeking re-election for a second term.  The Labour candidate Tim Starkey is a barrister specialising in criminal prosecutions.  The Lib Dem candidate Tim Bearder has appeared in this column a few times in the past: he worked as a BBC journalist before being elected to Oxfordshire county council and South Oxfordshire council, and he is Oxfordshire county council's cabinet member for adult social care.  Also standing are independent candidate Russell Fowler, and Ben Holden-Crowther who has bagged the ballot paper description "More Police Officers for Thames Valley".  Votes here will not be counted until Saturday.  Surprisingly there is no candidacy from former Thames Valley police DI James Hathaway, who may well have his eyes set on higher political office.
</p><p>
<h4>Local elections</h4>
</p><p>
There are elections this year for the whole of Wokingham council on new ward boundaries, one-half of Oxford council, and one-third of councillors in Cherwell, Milton Keynes, Reading and West Oxfordshire.  All of these are Friday counts except for Reading, whose results should come through overnight.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/mk21.png" alt="Milton Keynes, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
We'll start by looking at <b>Milton Keynes</b>, which has been a hung council for many years and has a Labour-Lib Dem coalition in place.  However, that may change at this election: the Labour group currently stands at 27 councillors with the Lib Dems on 16 and the Conservatives on 14, meaning that Labour are close to a council majority.  This year Labour are only defending five council seats from 2021 plus a defection gain from the Conservatives in Stony Stratford, and they recently successfully defended a by-election in the marginal Loughton and Shenley ward.  Based on the 2023 results, this column's par score is for five Labour gains in Milton Keynes giving overall control of the council.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/cherwell21.png" alt="Cherwell, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Moving over into Oxfordshire, in <b>Cherwell</b> district - whose main towns are Banbury and Bicester - the Conservative vote more or less collapsed in 2023 when they held only three seats and lost overall control of the council.  The Tories remain in minority control with 20 seats because a coalition deal could not be negotiated between Labour (12), the Lib Dems (10), the Greens (3) and independent councillors (3); progressive alliance types should probably remember that different left and centrist parties exist for a reason.  More than half of the Conservative group is up for re-election this year, and a repeat of 2023 would see the Conservatives lose four seats to the Lib Dems, two to Labour and two to the Greens; that would put Labour and the Lib Dems in a tie for first place with 14 seats each.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/w-oxon21.png" alt="W Oxon, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
The Conservatives should probably also brace themselves for further losses in <b>West Oxfordshire</b>, which is now run by a Lib Dem-led traffic-light coalition.  The former political home of the Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron now has 17 Lib Dem councillors, 16 Conservatives, 11 Labour, 3 Greens and two ex-Conservative independents.  The Tory cause will not be helped by their retiring councillor for Hailey, Minster Lovell and Leafield ward (who wasn't seeking re-election) being prosecuted last week for falsely claiming council tax reductions.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/oxford21.png" alt="Oxford, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
<b>Oxford</b> council has surprisingly been brought into play for this election following a recent split in the ruling Labour group, which has sent the council into No Overall Control.  The current composition has 20 Labour councillors, 9 Lib Dems, 6 Greens, 6 members of the new Oxford Socialist Independent group, 5 independent councillors and 2 vacant seats.  The Green Party, who would make two gains if the last city council results in 2022 were repeated, might seek to take advantage.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/wokingham21.png" alt="Wokingham, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Of the two Berkshire councils up for election, Reading is safe for Labour but all eyes will be on neighbouring <b>Wokingham</b>, where all the councillors are up on radical new ward boundaries.  This council fell into no overall control in 2022 after some years of Tory underperformance, and the Lib Dems became the largest party in 2023 with 26 seats against 22 Conservatives, 5 Labour and an independent councillor.  They currently run a minority administration.  Both the Lib Dems and the Conservatives will be looking for a majority here, and all three main parties will be looking for a good performance in the wards making up the new and fascinatingly unpredictable Earley and Woodley parliamentary seat.
</p><p>
<h2>Hampshire</h2>
</p><p>
<h4>Police and Crime Commissioner</h4>
</p><p>
The Hampshire PCC position was almost a Conservative win in the first round in 2021.  Donna Jones polled 49.8% of the vote against three candidates whose vote split roughly evenly: Labour were second on 19%, the Lib Dems third on 18%.  Jones is seeking another term of office; the Labour candidate Becky Williams is a Rushmoor councillor, Hampshire county councillor Prad Bains (who has previously served as the youngest-ever mayor of Havant) stands for the Lib Dems; and Don Jerrard completes the ballot paper for his Justice and Anti-Corruption Party.  Results here will be counted on Friday.
</p><p>
<h4>Local elections</h4>
</p><p>
There are elections this year for the whole of Fareham and Havant councils on new ward boundaries, one-half of Gosport council, and one-third of councillors in Basingstoke and Deane, Eastleigh, Hart, Portsmouth, Rushmoor, Southampton and Winchester.  All of these are overnight counts except for Basingstone and Deane, whose results will be declared on Friday.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/rushmoor21.png" alt="Rushmoor, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
We'll start by working our way down the M3 corridor with a district which hasn't really figured in these megapreviews before.  <b>Rushmoor</b> council covers the towns of Aldershot and Farnborough, and as such its economy is dominated by the Army, aerospace and related industries.  Rushmoor also has all of England and Wales' top four wards for Buddhism, and six of the top eight wards: this can also be linked to the Army, because Aldershot and Farnborough have a large population of either serving or retired Gurkhas.
</p><p>
Military towns have historically tended to go for the Conservatives in a big way, and Rushmoor council has been in Conservative hands continuously since 2000.  The 2021 results here - when the borough's thirteen wards split 11-2 between the Conservatives and Labour - are not untypical of those in recent years.  But in 2023 there was a big jump for Labour who suddenly gained five seats and turned this council into a marginal.  The latest composition has 23 Conservative seats (one of which is vacant) against 14 Labour and 2 Lib Dems; a repeat of last year's results would see Labour gain six seats, bringing them to the 20 required for an overall majority.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/hart21.png" alt="Hart, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
The neighbouring <b>Hart</b> council, the UK's least deprived local government district, has an almost perfect three-way split between the Conservatives (11), the Lib Dems (10 plus a vacant seat) and the Community Campaign (Hart) (10), plus one independent councillor.  The Lib Dems and the Community Campaign have a coalition and electoral pact to run the council.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/basingstoke-deane21.png" alt="Basingstoke and Deane, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Things are messier in <b>Basingstoke and Deane</b>, which is a hung council with 23 Conservatives, 11 independents, 10 Labour, 9 Lib Dems and a Green.  An independent-Lib Dem coalition is in place, but if the 2023 results are anything to go by it might struggle to make gains; the par score here is for four Conservative losses, with Labour being the main beneficiaries.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2022/gosport22.png" alt="Gosport, 2022" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Further down the M3, Winchester and Eastleigh councils both have secure Lib Dem majorities, while Southampton is safe for Labour and Fareham is securely in the Conservative column.  The all-out election in <b>Gosport</b> in 2022 returned a narrow Liberal Democrat majority with 16 councillors against 10 Conservatives and two Labour.  There are two wards with split C/LD representation, Lee East and Peel Common, both of which are Lib Dem defences this year; the party needs to hold one of these to keep its majority.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/portsmouth21.png" alt="Portsmouth, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Over the harbour in <b>Portsmouth</b> - one of the few remaining councils which has never had the full Andrew's Previews treatment over the last fourteen years - a hung council is currently run by a minority Lib Dem group with 18 seats; they face nine independent councillors, eight Conservatives and seven Labour.  Six of the independents are affiliated with the Portsmouth Independent Party, who have performed well in recent city elections.  More than half of the Conservative group are up for election this year: a repeat of 2023 would see the Tories lose four seats, with the Portsmouth Independent Party picking up two and the Lib Dems and Labour one each.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/havant21.png" alt="Havant, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
There are new ward boundaries this year and a whole council election in <b>Havant</b>, where the Conservatives won a clean sweep of all wards in 2021.  Unlike some other councils where this happened, like Tamworth, the Conservatives haven't collapsed at all here and still have a large majority: going into this election the council composition is 28 Conservatives, 4 Labour, 2 Lib Dems, 1 Green and three vacant seats.
</p><p>
The Conservatives have two by-elections to Hampshire county council to defend.  That in <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/i5lt">Fareham Sarisbury</a> division, which covers the Sarisbury and Swanwick areas to the east of the Hamble estuary and takes in the air traffic control centre at Swanwick, is to replace one of our longest-serving council leaders: Seán Woodward is retiring this year after 25 unbroken years as leader of Fareham council, and he has taken the opportunity to stand down from the county council as well.  <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/ismt">Meon Valley</a> division stretches from Whiteley, next to Swanwick, a long way to the north-east as far as the village of West Meon.  Both of these are safe Conservative at county level and Fareham Sarisbury is like that at district level too, but Meon Valley division is part of the Winchester district where the Conservative vote has collapsed in recent years: both the Lib Dems and Greens won district council seats here in 2023.  The defending Conservative candidates are Neil Bolton in Meon Valley and Joanne Burton in Fareham Sarisbury; other candidates in Fareham Sarisbury are independent candidate Nick Gregory, Graham Everdell for the Lib Dems and the wonderfully-named Verden Meldrum for Labour, while Meon Valley is additionally contested by the Greens' Malcolm Wallace, the Lib Dems' Vivian Achwal and Labour's Oliver Hirsch.
</p><p>
The Hampshire police area includes the Isle of Wight, where there are no elections this year.  The Wight council elected in 2021 had a four-year term and is up for re-election in 2025.
</p><p>
<h2>Surrey</h2>
</p><p>
<h4>Police and Crime Commissioner</h4>
</p><p>
The Conservative vote in traditionally true-blue Surrey seems to have gone into freefall in recent years.  But in PCC terms the party has been underperforming for a long time: the inaugural 2012 election was won by an independent, Kevin Hurley, and in 2021 the Conservatives' Lisa Townsend finished top with just 34% of the vote.  21% went to the Lib Dems, 18% to Hurley, 16% to Labour and 12% to the outgoing Conservative PCC David Munro, who unsuccessfully sought re-election as an independent.  Munro subsequently appeared in this column when he won a by-election to Waverley council, standing as an independent and gaining his seat from the Conservatives.
</p><p>
Lisa Townsend is seeking another term of office.  The Lib Dems have selected Mole Valley councillor Paul Kennedy.  Labour's Kate Chinn is an Epsom and Ewell councillor as is the remaining candidate Alex Coley, who was elected to that council as a Residents candidate but is standing for PCC as an independent.  Coley is the chair of Epsom and Ewell council's wonderfully-named Crime and Disorder Committee.  Results from this election should come through on Friday.
</p><p>
<h4>Local elections</h4>
</p><p>
There are elections this year for the whole of Tandridge council on new ward boundaries and for one-third of councillors in Elmbridge, Mole Valley, Reigate and Banstead, Runnymede and Woking.  All of these are Friday counts.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/reigate-banstead21.png" alt="Reigate/Banstead, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
It says a lot about how far the Conservative brand has sunk that they no longer have majority control of any district in Surrey.  The last domino to fall was <b>Reigate and Banstead</b>, which recently fell into a Conservative minority when councillor Zelanie Cooper quit the party; she is seeking re-election as an independent candidate in Lower Kingswood, Tadworth and Walton ward.  The current composition has 22 Conservatives, 11 Greens, 6 Residents (including a vacant seat), 3 Lib Dems, 2 independents and one Labour.  A repeat of 2023 would see the Conservatives lose one seat nett to the Greens and also lose Redhill West and Wray Common ward to Labour.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/woking21.png" alt="Woking, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
In recent years the Liberal Democrats have built up a very large majority in Mole Valley district, while last year they gained control of bankrupt <b>Woking</b> council which now stands at 20 Lib Dem seats (one of which is vacant), 4 Conservatives, 4 independents and 2 Labour.  All four remaining Tory councillors are up for re-election this year and the Woking Conservatives are facing the prospect of wipeout - which rather reflects what they did to the borough's finances before the recent Lib Dem takeover.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/runnymede21.png" alt="Runnymede, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
<b>Runnymede</b> district went into No Overall Control last year, with a Conservative minority administration of 19 seats (one of which is vacant) facing six councillors from the Runnymede Independent Residents Group, 5 independents, 4 each from Labour and the Lib Dems, 2 Greens and one ex-Tory councillor who has walked off to join Reform UK.  He was the outgoing councillor for Addlestone North ward, which voted Green last year, but is seeking re-election in Englefield Green West.  A repeat of last year's results would see the Conservatives lose three seats, with Labour gains in Egham Hythe and Englefield Green West wards plus a Lib Dem gain in New Haw ward.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/elmbridge21.png" alt="Elmbridge, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Further into the Surrey commuter belt we have the <b>Elmbridge</b> district, which is one of a number of Surrey councils where Residents Associations are a significant factor.  The Residents currently have a coalition agreement with the Lib Dems, who have rather usurped them in recent years to become the largest party on a hung council: there are currently 20 Lib Dems, 16 Residents and 12 Conservatives.  The Liberal Democrats did very well in the 2023 elections here, and a repeat of that would see them confirm a by-election gain from the Residents in Molesey East and make five other gains (four from the Conservatives, one from the Residents): that would give 25 Lib Dem seats and an overall majority.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/tandridge21.png" alt="Tandridge, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
We have an all-out election to <b>Tandridge</b> council which covers the rural eastern end of Surrey.  This has been subject to an independent/Residents takeover in recent years; the council is currently run by the Residents Alliance of 10 independents and eight councillors from the Oxted and Limpsfield Residents Group, who face-off against 11 Lib Dems, 9 Conservatives and four other independents.  There's not much sign from last year's elections that this will significantly change.
</p><p>
There is one by-election to Waverley council for the <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/iudy">Witley and Milford</a> ward, which covers villages in the Surrey countryside to the south-west of Godalming.  This ward split its three seats three ways in 2023, between independent councillor Maxine Gale who had won a February 2020 by-election for the former Milford ward; the Lib Dems' Andrew Law; and the Conservatives' Phoebe Sullivan, who defeated her running-mate Gary Hudson for the final seat by just one vote.  Andrew Law died in January, so after some delay the Lib Dems are defending a by-election which is hard to call.  Their defending candidate is Laura Cavaliere, who takes on independent Tony Sollars and Gary Hudson (again) for the Conservatives.
</p><p>
<h2>Sussex</h2>
</p><p>
<h4>Police and Crime Commissioner</h4>
</p><p>
Katy Bourne of the Conservatives has been the Sussex police and crime commissioner since the post was set up in 2012.  In 2021 she was re-elected for a third term of office with 47% of the vote, against 19% for Labour and 14% for the Lib Dems.  Bourne is seeking a fourth term of office against Labour's Paul Richards, who runs a communications firm; the Lib Dems' Jamie Bennett who is a hotel manager and former Arun councillor; and the Green Party's Jonathan Kent.  This will be one of the last results to come through, with counting not due to start until Sunday.
</p><p>
<h4>Local elections</h4>
</p><p>
There are elections this year for one-half of councillors in Adur and Hastings and for one-third of councillors in Crawley and Worthing.  All of these will count their votes on Friday.
</p><p>

We'll start with <b>Crawley</b>, a two-party state where Labour currently have a 20-16 council majority over the Conservatives.  The Tories' situation looks like it's about to get worse, as a repeat of last year's performance would result in three net gains for Labour.
</p><p>

</p><p>
Following the recent Labour takeover in Worthing and massive Tory losses elsewhere in the county in 2023, the last-remaining Conservative-majority district in Sussex is <b>Adur</b> - which wasn't up for election in 2023.  Here the Conservative overall majority is just one seat: they have 15 councillors against 9 Labour seats (one of which is vacant), 3 independents and 2 Greens.  Labour actually polled the most votes here in 2022, but that was mainly because the Conservatives didn't oppose the independent councillor for Marine ward.  A repeat of the 2022 results would see Labour gain Eastbrook ward from the Conservatives, tipping Adur council into No Overall Control.

</p><p>
<b>Hastings</b>, on the other hand, has turned into a very messy hung council.  Labour lost control of this council in 2022 after losing seats to the Greens; a Labour minority administration resulted.  The Labour group then split down the middle last December with eight of its 14 members - including the entire cabinet - walking off to form a new Hastings Independents group.  The Hastings Independents now run the council in coalition with the Green Party - the council composition is 10 Conservatives, 8 Hastings Independents, 6 members of the rump Labour group, 4 Greens, 3 other independents and one councillor who left the Conservatives to join Reform UK.  Goodness knows what the electors will make of this - but if the last elections in 2022 are anything to go by, the Greens should be well-placed to make gains.
</p><p>
Our final two local by-elections are in adjoining wards in the city of Brighton and Hove.  <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/iksy">Kemptown</a> and <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/iqsy">Queen's Park</a> wards lie to the east of Brighton city centre, with Kemptown being a long and thin ward running along the seafront while Queen's Park ward lies inland.  Eastern Road is the boundary between the wards.  Brighton and Hove was taken over by Labour at the 2023 local elections and both of these wards are safely part of the Labour majority.
</p><p>
These by-elections both arise as the result of a scandal involving Kemptown councillor Bharti Gajjar and her daughter Chandni Mistry, who is the youngest member of the council and represented Queen's Park ward.  Both of them were thrown out of the Labour party in December over allegations that they do not live in the city: Mistry is a student reading medicine at Lancaster University, while a Companies House filing for Gajjar gives a correspondence address in Leicester.  The pair have also become embroiled in legal action in India.  Labour have a good opportunity to take these seats back in the by-elections, with their defending candidates being Théresa Mackey in Kemptown and Milla Gauge in Queen's Park.  The other candidates for Kemptown ward are Ricky Perrin for the Greens, Gary Farmer for the Brighton and Hove Independents, Josephine O'Carroll for the Conservatives, Robert Brown for the Lib Dems and independent candidate Jamie Gillespie; while Queen's Park is additionally contested by the Greens' Luke Walker, the Brighton and Hove Independents' Adrian Hart, the Conservatives' Sunny Choudhury and the Liberal Democrats' Dominique Hall.

<h4>Police and Crime Commissioner</h4>
</p><p>
Our last PCC election this year comes in one of the strongest counties for the Conservatives in 2021.  Matthew Scott was re-elected for a second term three years ago with a 58-25 lead over Labour.  He is seeking a third term now against Labour candidate Lenny Rolles, who is a Gravesham councillor, and Lib Dem Graham Colley.  Again, this will not be counted until Sunday making Kent PCC one of the last results to declare.
</p><p>
<h4>Local elections</h4>
</p><p>
There are elections this year for the whole of Maidstone council, which is moving off the thirds electoral cycle, and for the whole of Tunbridge Wells council on new ward boundaries.  Both of these are Friday counts.
</p><p>

</p><p>
<b>Maidstone</b> has been one of the brighter spots in Kent local government for the Conservatives in recent years, but they are currently short of a majority and run the council as a minority.  There are currently 25 Conservative councillors, 12 Lib Dems, 11 independents of varying stripes, 4 Labour and 3 Greens.  The way the borough's previous wards came up for election makes it difficult to construct a par score, but the Conservatives performed well here in 2021 and defending all of those seats could be difficult.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/tunbridge-wells21.png" alt="Tunbridge Wells, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Finally we come to the spiritual home of disgust, <b>Tunbridge Wells</b>, where the voters have made their disgust with the Conservatives abundantly clear in recent years.  The council currently has 17 Lib Dem councillors, 11 Conservatives, 9 seats for the Tunbridge Wells Alliance, 7 Labour and 4 independents.  The Lib Dems, Tunbridge Wells Alliance and Labour are in coalition.  In each of the last two years the Conservatives have won just two wards (behind Labour's three) despite still topping the poll across the district, which shows just how badly their brand has sunk here.  Based on the 2023 results, we can probably expect the current coalition to continue.

Part IV of the May megapreview will cover the Blackpool South by-election.  Stay tuned for that.
