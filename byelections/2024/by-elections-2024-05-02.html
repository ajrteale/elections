<!-- 2nd May 2024 -->
<h2>Wales</h2>
</p><p>
Let's start with the easy bit.  With Senedd Cymru next up for election in 2026 and the Welsh local government term expiring in 2027, the only polls in Wales on 2nd May 2024 are for its four Police and Crime Commissioners.  Welsh returning officers have scrupulously avoided scheduling any local by-elections for today because of the different rules for PCC and Welsh local elections: most notably, PCC elections require Voter ID and Welsh local elections don't.  The Welsh local election franchise is also wider than the PCC franchise.
</p><p>
<h3>Police and Crime Commissioners</h3>
</p><p>
At the last elections Wales saw two instances of the now-abolished Supplementary Vote system resulting in a come-from-behind win for the candidate who started in second.  Both of these involved close three-way results with low vote shares for the first-preference leader, so the old system was doing its job in seeing through vote splits and ensuring that the winning candidate had the broadest possible support.
</p><p>
We can see this very clearly in <b>North Wales</b> where there was a close three-way fight in the first round in 2021.  The Conservatives led with just 32%, Labour polled 29% and Plaid Cymru (who were defending the position) 28%; Labour went on to win on transfers from Plaid and minor parties.  Labour PPC Andy Dunbobbin is seeking a second term of office.
</p><p>
A similar freak vote split gave the Conservatives a tiny first-round lead in <b>Dyfed-Powys</b>, with 34.0% against 33.6% for Plaid Cymru and 24% for Labour.  Plaid's Dafydd Llywelyn was the incumbent, and he went on to win the runoff quite easily.
</p><p>
The two PCC positions in industrial south Wales are both safely Labour.  Last time out the first-round shares in <b>Gwent</b> were 42% for Labour, 29% for the Conservatives and 16% for Plaid Cymru.  Labour PCC Jeff Cuthbert is retiring after two terms and the new Labour candidate is Jane Mudd, the leader of Newport council.
</p><p>
We also have a retirement in <b>South Wales</b> where octogenarian political veteran Alun Michael is standing down after three terms as Labour PCC.  He wasn't seriously challenged for his final election in 2021, polling 41% of the first preferences against 24% for the Conservatives and 19% for Plaid.  Michael's deputy Emma Wools has been selected as the new Labour candidate for South Wales PCC.
</p><p>
Last time out all of these elections were combined with the 2021 Senedd election.  For that reason, and perhaps also because this is the first Welsh election which requires Voter ID, we can expect a massive drop in turnout across the board.  Expect that to be a big story of the Welsh PCC elections, whatever result they come up with.

<h2>London</h2>
</p><p>
<h3>Mayor and Assembly</h3>
</p><p>
We now turn to the biggest single election in the UK, the sixth poll for the post of <b>Mayor of London</b>.  This is defended by Labour mayor Sadiq Khan, who in 2021 led the Conservatives' Shaun Bailey by the rather close level of 40-35 in the first round before winning the runoff decisively.  This time there will be no runoff, so we may see a mayor elected on a minority vote for the first time.
</p><p>
Khan, who won more than a million first preferences last time, is seeking re-election for a third term of office.  The Conservative candidate is Susan Hall, who has sat on the London Assembly since 2017: she originally took over the Londonwide seat left behind by Kemi Badenoch after Badenoch's election to Parliament.  Hall is also a Harrow councillor representing Hatch End ward, and she was briefly leader of that council in 2013-14 after Harrow's then Labour administration fell apart.
</p><p>
The Green Party (who were third in 2021 with 7.8%) have selected ZoÃ« Garbett, who appeared in this column last year when she was the Green candidate in the Hackney mayoral by-election; she is a Hackney councillor representing Dalston ward.  The Lib Dem candidate (4th, 4.4%) is Rob Blackie, who works in digital marketing and has recently completed a course of treatment for cancer.  There are a number of anti-ULEZ candidates on the ballot including podcaster Brian Rose, who placed 7th here in 2021 for his London Real Party.  Defending ninth place is Count Binface, who needs no introduction.  Twelfth last time were the Animal Welfare Party who have secured top spot on the ballot paper by selecting former Afghan refugee Femy Amin: she was fourth on the party's list in 2021, and she fought Ruislip, Northwood and Pinner in December 2019.  Independent candidate Farah London, who placed 14th here in 2021, is back for another go; she will improve on that position, as will the SDP's Amy Gallagher whose party starts 17th, because this time there are only 13 candidates for the electors of London to choose from.
</p><p>
Of the candidates and parties who didn't stand last time, if the national polls are any guide then the one to watch is Howard Cox.  He is a longtime campaigner against fuel duty increases standing on a stridently anti-ULEZ and pro-motorist ticket, and he is the candidate of Reform UK.  In 2021 Reform stood on the Londonwide list (finishing 10th out of 18 parties with 1.0%) but didn't stand a candidate for mayor, instead endorsing the Reclaim candidate Laurence Fox who finished sixth in that poll with 1.9%.  Fox himself applied to stand in this election as an independent candidate, but he was one of two candidates (along with YouTuber Niko Omilana, who was 5th last time with 2.0%) who had their nominations rejected: to stand for Mayor of London you need to get the paperwork signed by ten electors from each borough plus ten electors from the City of London, and when the returning officer checked the forms there were issues with the signtures which Fox and Omilana couldn't sort out before the deadline.  That leaves three independents on the ballot: Natalie Campbell, the chancellor of the University of Westminster, is a businesswoman running a bottled water firm who applied for the Conservative nomination and didn't get it; Tarun Ghulati is an investment banker standing on an anti-ULEZ ticket; and Andreas Michli is a businessman who got into legal trouble for keeping his gym open during lockdown: he is also anti-ULEZ, and he wants Metropolitan Police officers to be trained to blue-belt level in Brazilian jiu-jitsu.  Last on the mayoral ballot is Nick Scanlon for Britain First.
</p><p>
The <b>Greater London Assembly</b> is the only English elected body to use proportional representation.  Last time around Labour polled 38% of the vote on the Londonwide list ballot and won 11 seats; the Conservatives polled 31% of the vote and won 9 seats; the Greens polled 12% and won 3 seats; and the Liberal Democrats won 2 seats with 7%, with no other parties coming close to the 5% threshold which applies to the list vote.  To date no party has ever held the 13 seats required for an overall majority in the Assembly: to do so Labour will need to improve their list vote.

<h2>North East</h2>
</p><p>
<h3>Mayors</h3>
</p><p>
We'll now commence our tour of England outside London by starting in the North East, where everybody has at least two votes: one for a regional mayor, one for a Police and Crime Commissioner, and possibly a local council election on top.  Because the mayoral and police boundaries don't match up, I'll take this region as a single section.
</p><p>
The two mayoral contests in this region are a large one and a small one.  The large one is for the <b>North East</b> Mayoral Combined Authority, a new body which is taking over from the former North of Tyne Combined Authority and the former North East Combined Authority.  The new body covers the metropolitan county of Tyne and Wear together with the Durham and Northumberland council areas.
</p><p>
The presence here of the strongly Labour-voting county of Tyne and Wear means that this post should be Labour's to lose.  If we add together the 2021 results in the Northumbria and Durham police areas while deducting votes cast in Darlington (which is not part of this mayoral area), then we get a Labour lead of 46-33 over the Conservatives.  In the 2019 general election the constituencies covering this area returned 15 Labour MPs and six Conservatives, with the latter tally including the Sedgefield constituency which straddles the Durham-Darlington council boundary.
</p><p>
This new mayoral post supersedes the North of Tyne mayoral position which went to the polls in 2021.  That was won by Labour candidate Jamie Driscoll, who was very much on the left of the party and was blocked from the Labour nomination for the new mayoral post.  He is standing as an independent.  The official Labour candidate is Kim McGuinness, who is currently the Northumbria police and crime commissioner.  The Conservative candidate is Guy Renner-Thompson, who is a Northumberland councillor for Bamburgh division; he sits on the Northumberland council cabinet, with the children's and education portfolio.
</p><p>
The smaller mayoral position in this region is the <b>Tees Valley</b> mayoralty, which covers the five boroughs of Darlington, Hartlepool, Middlesbrough, Redcar and Cleveland, and Stockton-on-Tees.  This has been held since its establishment in 2017 by Lord Houchen of High Leven, a Conservative mayor who was re-elected for a second term in 2021 with a crushing 72-28 over Labour in a straight fight; despite this, Houchen has never been far away from the pages of <em>Private Eye</em>, and local election results in the five boroughs last year were not encouraging for him.  Houchen is seeking a third term of office against Labour candidate Chris McEwan, who is deputy leader of Darlington council.
</p><p>
<h3>Police and Crime Commissioners</h3>
</p><p>
As stated, the current <b>Northumbria</b> PCC Kim McGuinness is seeking election as the first North East mayor.  She leaves behind a safe PCC position in the Northumbria police area, covering both the Tyne and Wear county and Northumberland, where in 2021 she polled 47% against 31% for the Conservatives and 12% for an independent candidate.  Hoping to take over for Labour is Susan Dungworth, whose recent electoral record has been accident-prone: she was the Labour candidate who lost the safe seat of Blyth Valley in the 2019 general election, and she went on to lose her Northumberland council seat in Hartley ward in 2021 on the returning officer's drawing of lots after tying for first place with the Conservative candidate.
</p><p>
The <b>Durham</b> PCC position, which covers the Durham council area and Darlington, was extremely close in 2021: new Labour candidate Joy Allen won the runoff by just 51-49 over the much-travelled Conservative candidate George Jabbour, who has since finally achieved elected office as a North Yorkshire councillor.  The margin on first preferences was even closer, at 43.8-43.0 to Labour.
</p><p>
The Conservatives won everything up for election in the Tees Valley boroughs in 2021, including the <b>Cleveland</b> PCC: Steve Turner gained the position from Labour by the wide margin of 54-29.
</p><p>
<h3>Local elections</h3>
</p><p>
There are elections this year for all councillors in North Tyneside on new boundaries (but not the mayor, whose term runs to 2025), and for one-third of councillors in Gateshead, Newcastle upon Tyne, South Tyneside, Sunderland and Hartlepool.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/sunderland21.png" alt="Sunderland, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
It's traditional to start in <b>Sunderland</b>, which makes a point of trying to be first to declare its council results - although, with PCC and mayoral votes to be verified before the local count can begin, that might not be the case this year.  The danger for Sunderland Labour in recent years now appears to have passed, and the council currently has a large Labour majority with 47 seats against 13 Conservatives, 12 Lib Dems, 3 independents and 1 for Reform UK.  The 2021 results saw big gains for the Conservatives and Lib Dems in Sunderland proper, but the par score is for Labour to gain five seats.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/hartlepool21.png" alt="Hartlepool, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Instead the one to watch in this region is <b>Hartlepool</b>, which was left on a knife-edge by the 2023 elections: Labour have 18 seats, half of the council, but they are shut out of power by 12 Conservatives, 6 independents and the mayoral casting vote.  This year Labour are only defending Victoria ward and a by-election gain from the independents in Foggy Furze ward <!-- 2022-09-08 -->.  They only need one gain to take control of the council; last year's elections saw a Labour landslide here, and this column sets a par score of <em>seven</em> Labour gains in Hartlepool at this election.
</p><p>
The other four Tyne and Wear boroughs have large Labour majorities which are not in serious danger.  The outgoing localist councillor for Lemington ward in Newcastle resigned shortly before the election and there hasn't been time to hold a by-election to replace him.  This means that readers of this column didn't get to see my photograph of the surviving section of Hadrian's Wall that runs through Lemington ward, right next to the A69 arterial road.  Let's rectify that.
</p><p>

</p><p>
There definitely had been time for a by-election in the Cullercoats ward of North Tyneside, where a seat has been vacant since October following the death of Conservative councillor Linda Arkley.  She was a high-profile political veteran, having been first elected to the council in 1991 (originally serving for Tynemouth ward).  In June 2003 there was a by-election for Mayor of North Tyneside after Conservative mayor Christopher Morgan was forced to resign over a child pornography scandal (he was found not guilty on all charges at the time, but was successfully prosecuted for similar offences many years later).  Arkley held the mayoralty for the Conservatives in the 2003 by-election, lost it to Labour in 2005, got it back in 2009 but lost re-election again in 2013.  In 2018 Linda Arkley was appointed OBE for political service in the north-east of England; after unsuccessfully applying for the Conservative nomination for the 2021 North of Tyne mayoral election, she returned to North Tyneside council in 2021 as councillor for Cullercoats ward.  Arkley passed away in October at the age of 71, and nobody ever called a by-election for her vacant seat.

<h2>Cumbria</h2>
</p><p>
<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>
</p><p>
In Cumbria the main action is in the PCC election, which is defended by the Conservatives' Peter McCall.  He won last time in the first round, with 54% of the vote against 26% for Labour and 20% for the Lib Dems.  Local elections in the county since have not been promising for the Conservatives: Cumbria's local government was reorganised in 2023, with Labour holding a majority in the new Cumberland council and the Lib Dems having overall control in Westmorland and Furness.

<h2>Lancashire</h2>
</p><p>
This will be covered in Part IV - the Parliamentary Special.
</p><p>
<h2>Merseyside and Cheshire</h2>
</p><p>
I've taken the Merseyside and Cheshire police areas together because of the presence of Halton borough, which is part of the Cheshire PCC election but also participates in the election of the Liverpool City Region mayor alongside the five Merseyside brooguhs.
</p><p>
<h3>Mayor</h3>
</p><p>
The Liverpool City Region mayoralty has been held since its creation in 2017 by Labour's Steve Rotheram, who won re-election in 2021 with a 58-20 lead over the Conservatives.  Since 2021 Rotheram has negotiated a deal which will give the combined authority control over bus franchising, allowing the mayor to specify routes, frequencies and fareas.  There is nothing to suggest he will struggle for re-election.
</p><p>
<h3>Police and Crime Commissioners</h3>
</p><p>
The Merseyside PCC position is equally safe for the Labour incumbent Emily Spurrell, who had a 57-23 lead over the Conservatives in 2021.
</p><p>
Cheshire PCC, by contrast, is consistently marginal.  First preferences here in 2021 were 45% for the Conservatives, 37% for Labour and 14% for the Lib Dems, with the Conservative candidate John Dwyer going on to gain the position from Labour.
</p><p>
<h3>Local elections</h3>
</p><p>
There are elections here for the whole of Warrington council, and for one-third of councillors in Halton, Knowsley and Sefton.  All of these councils have large Labour majorities, although in the case of <b>Warrington</b> Labour have put in some indifferent by-election results over the last three years and the council continues to generate publicity over its very high debt level.

<h2>Greater Manchester</h2>
</p><p>
<h3>Mayors</h3>
</p><p>
Possibly the most powerful of all England's regional mayoralties is that in Greater Manchester, where Andy Burnham has built up a nice little empire.  The <b>Greater Manchester</b> Combined Authority has control over (among other things) Greater Manchester Police, the county's health and social care budget, and most prominently the buses.
</p><p>
Having successfully seen off legal challenges from bus companies, Burnham is presently in the middle of a high-profile and very visible reform of Greater Manchester's bus network.  Greater Manchester was the first part of England to cap bus single fares at Â£2 (which represented a massive fare cut), and buses across the north of the county are now fully regulated and franchised under the banner of the Bee Network - with the south of the county to follow at the start of next year.  Yellow Bee Network buses are now a familiar sight on Greater Manchester's roads.  Mayor Burnham has achieved all this without resorting to road user charging: plans for a Clean Air Zone - in the vein of London's ULEZ - have apparently been seen off in favour of investment in electric buses and taxis to reduce pollution.
</p><p>
All this, together with visibly sticking up for the county and indeed the region during the COVID-19 pandemic, has made Labour's Andy Burnham one of the most popular politicians in the country.  In 2021 he won a second term of office as mayor with 67% of the first preference vote, with only the Conservatives (20%) providing any sort of opposition.  A ward-level breakdown of that vote was published, and Burnham carried not just every borough but every <em>ward</em> in Greater Manchester - including bastions of the middle class like Bramhall, Hale Barns and Bromley Cross.  Nothing has happened since to suggest that Burnham will struggle for re-election.
</p><p>
Andy Burnham's designated deputy mayor is Labour's Paul Dennett, who is himself up for re-election this year as the elected mayor of <b>Salford</b>.  Neither of his two election wins to date went to transfers: in 2021 Dennett won a second term of office with a 59-23 lead over the Conservatives.
</p><p>
<h3>Local elections</h3>
</p><p>
There are local elections for one-third of the councillors in every Greater Manchester borough.  Of these, eight have Labour majorities and two are under no overall control.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2023/bolton23.png" alt="Bolton, 2023" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
As usual, the one to watch is <b>Bolton</b>.  This had a whole-council election in 2023 which returned a hung council of 26 Labour councillors, 17 Conservatives, 6 Lib Dems and 11 localists: the latter broke down as 6 seats for Horwich and Blackrod First, 3 members of the One Kearsley party and 2 seats for Farnworth and Kearsley First.  Labour formed a minority administration, ending four years of Conservative minority rule.  The One Kearsley party subsequently disbanded: one of their councillors resigned provoking a by-election in Kearsley ward which was won by Farnworth and Kearsley First, and the other two ex-One Kearsley councillors joined Labour putting the party three seats short of an overall majority.
</p><p>
Opportunities for Labour gains here are limited because they are defending 11 of the borough's 20 wards, including the defection gain in Kearsley: that includes seats in the split wards of Astley Bridge, Breightmet, Farnworth South, Kearsley, and your columnist's own Little Lever and Darcy Lever: the party will be under pressure from Farnworth and Kearsley First in Farnworth South and Kearsley wards and from the Conservatives in the other three wards listed, which are all in the very marginal parliamentary seat of Bolton North East.  The best opportunities for Labour gains are in Hulton, where the Conservative councillor up for election was disendorsed by the party during the 2023 campaign, and in the perennially unpredictable ward of Westhoughton South which the Liberal Democrats are defending.  The Lib Dems are also defending a by-election gain from the Conservatives in Westhoughton North and Hunger Hill.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2022/bury22.png" alt="Bolton, 2023" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
<b>Bury</b> council now has a Labour majority which looks secure enough: they have 31 seats against 11 Conservatives, 7 Radcliffe First localists and 2 independents (one of whom was elected on the Radcliffe First ticket).  The seats being defended here are from all-out elections in 2022; the par score is for just one ward to change hands, with the Conservatives gaining Radcliffe North and Ainsworth from Radcliffe First.  Radcliffe North and Ainsworth is transferring from the very marginal seat of Bury South to the equally marginal seat of Bury North for the next general election.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2022/rochdale22.png" alt="Rochdale, 2022" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
In <b>Rochdale</b> Labour hold three-quarters of the council seats but neither of the borough's two MPs: the Heywood and Middleton constituency is held by the Conservatives' Chris Clarkson with a small majority, while the Rochdale constituency is now in the hands of George Galloway following the unforced Labour loss in the recent parliamentary by-election.  The forthcoming parliamentary boundary changes transfer Spotland and Falinge ward from Galloway's seat to Clarkson's, which is very unhelpful for both of them; indeed, the redrawn Heywood and Middleton North has a notional Labour majority, and Clarkson has decided not to seek re-election to Parliament.  Control of the council is not up for grabs here, but it might be interesting to see if a few Gallowayite candidates do well in the Muslim wards of Rochdale proper - something similar happened in Bradford immediately following the Bradford West by-election a decade ago.  Again, the seats up for election in Rochdale are from all-out elections in 2022: the par score is for Labour to confirm a defection gain from the Middleton Independents Party in East Middleton ward, with no changes elsewhere.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2023/oldham23.png" alt="Rochdale, 2023" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
All-out elections in <b>Oldham</b> last year returned a small Labour majority, with 32 seats against 11 Conservatives, 10 Lib Dems, 4 independents and 3 Failsworth localists.  Labour have since recruited to their banner Hussain Aftab, an independent councillor for St Mary's ward, while the three Conservative councillors for Hollinwood ward - which is not natural Conservative territory in any sense - have walked out of the party and formed their own group.  Labour have seats to defend in the split wards of Failsworth West (from independents), Royton South (from independents) and St James' (from the Conservatives); the Lib Dems are defending Saddleworth North ward, where the other two councillors are Conservative, and Shaw ward where an independent topped the poll in 2023.
</p><p>
There were also all-out elections last year in Greater Manchester's other hung council, <b>Stockport</b>.  Amazingly for a borough which includes places like Cheadle, Bramhall and Marple, this is now a Tory-free zone: the 2023 elections returned 30 Lib Dem councillors, 24 Labour, and three seats each for the Green Party, the Heald Green Ratepayers and the Edgeley Community Association.  The wards with split representation are Bredbury and Woodley, Cheadle East and Cheadle Hulme North, and Offerton: all of these are being defended by Labour this year against the Lib Dems.  The Liberal Democrats run a minority administration: for an overall majority they need to gain two of those wards and hold the nine seats they are defending.
</p><p>
The <b>Salford</b> elected mayoralty was covered above.  Labour have large majorities on that council and in <b>Manchester</b>, <b>Tameside</b>, <b>Trafford</b> and <b>Wigan</b> which are under no threat at all.

<h2>Yorkshire and the Humber</h2>
</p><p>
<h2>West Yorkshire</h2>
</p><p>
<h3>Mayor</h3>
</p><p>
Like her counterpart over the Pennines, the Mayor of West Yorkshire has control over the police and so there is no Police and Crime Commissioner for the county.  Labour's Tracey Brabin won the inaugural West Yorkshire mayoral election in 2021 easily, polling 43% of the first prefernences against 29% for the Conservatives and 10% for the Yorkshire Party.  Brabin had to resign her parliamentary seat in Batley and Spen in consequence; Labour just about held the resulting by-election under pressure from both the Conservatives and George Galloway, before going on to gain a parliamentary by-election in Wakefield from the Conservatives the following year.
</p><p>
<h3>Local elections</h3>
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/kirklees21.png" alt="Kirklees, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
There are local elections for a third of councillors in the five West Yorkshire boroughs, all of which have Labour majorities.  The most marginal of these is <b>Kirklees</b> borough, covering the Huddersfield and Dewsbury areas, which has a Labour majority of one seat: 35 councillors against 18 Conservatives, 8 Lib Dems, 4 members of a Labour splinter group, 3 Greens and an ex-Labour independent.  One of the defectors is up for re-election this year: that's Ebrahim Dockrat, who won a by-election in Batley East ward only last August.  A repeat of last year's results would see Labour improve their position by one seat net, gaining Denby Dale and Holme Valley South wards from the Conservatives but losing Golcar ward sto the Liberal Democrats.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/calderdale21.png" alt="Calderdale, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Meanwhile in <b>Calderdale</b> we have an only slightly larger Labour majority, with 27 councillors against 15 Conservative seats (one of which is vacant), 6 Lib Dems, 2 Greens and an ex-Labour independent.  The par score is for the Conservatives to lose three seats here: a repeat of 2023 would see Elland ward and Illingworth and Mixenden ward going to Labour and Northowram and Shelf ward going to the Green Party.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/bradford21.png" alt="Bradford, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
In <b>Bradford</b> the Labour majority has been eroded by defections in recent months: there are currently 53 Labour councillors, 15 Conservatives, 8 Greens, 5 Lib Dems and 9 independents of various political hues.  Labour probably shouldn't be too worried about that: a repeat of 2023 would deliver seven Labour net gains here.  The Labour majority in <b>Leeds</b> is under little threat, and in <b>Wakefield</b> the Conservative group has fallen apart so badly that the party is notionally defending eight wards but only has five councillors left.

</p><p>
<h2>North Yorkshire</h2>
</p><p>
Another new piece in the devolution jigsaw falls into place this year with the creation of a new combined authority for <b>York and North Yorkshire</b>.  This will have the power to directly invest and transport and housing, and will also take over the police and crime commissioner powers.
</p><p>
That means we see the abolition of the North Yorkshire police and crime commissionership, which has been in Conservative hands since its creation in 2012.  In May 2021 North Yorkshire elected a new PCC, Philip Allott, who polled 47% of the votes in the first round against 26% for Labour and 15% for independent candidate Keith Tordoff.  Allott was forced to resign just five months later over insensitive comments about the Sarah Everard murder; the resulting by-election in November 2021 elected the Conservatives' ZoÃ« Metcalf with 40% against 21% for Labour and 17% for Tordoff (<em>Andrew's Previews 2021</em>, page 495).
</p><p>
Subsequent polls in the county have seen the Conservatives go backwards.  North Yorkshire has recently had its local government reorganised, and the May 2022 county council elections returned a small Conservative majority which has since disappaeared thanks to defection and by-election losses.  Shortly afterwards the Conservatives lost a safe parliamentary seat to Labour in the July 2022 Selby and Ainsty by-election.
</p><p>
There are no local elections this year in North Yorkshire or York.
</p><p>
<h2>Humberside</h2>
</p><p>
<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>
</p><p>
With regional mayors taking over PCC roles in North Yorkshire (above) and South Yorkshire (below), there is now only one remaining police and crime commissioner in Yorkshire.  This is in Humberside, a marginal police area where the PCC position has regularly swung between the Conservatives and Labour; despite a last-minute change of candidate in the 2021 election, the Conservatives' PCC Jonathan Evison gained the position from Labour in 2021 by a 46-39 margin.
</p><p>
<h3>By-elections</h3>
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/hull21.png" alt="Hull, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
There are elections this year for one-third of the councillors in Hull and North East Lincolnshire.  The city of <b>Kingston upon Hull</b> is currently a two-party state, with the Lib Dems enjoying a 33-24 majority over Labour; this includes a recent by-election gain in Avenue ward and a defection gain in Longhill and Bilton Grange ward.  The Liberal Democrats are defending both of those wards this time.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/ne-lincs21.png" alt="NE Lincs, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
<b>North East Lincolnshire</b> has a large Conservative majority: there are currently 27 Conservative councillors against 9 Labour, 3 Lib Dems and 3 independents.  But, as can be seen from the map, this majority rests on a wave election in 2021 when the Conservatives won 11 wards out of a possible 12; and that hasn't been repeated since.  The par score here is for the Conservatives to lose six seats, four to Labour and two to independents: that would leave a hung council with the Conservatives relying on the mayoral casting vote.
</p><p>
<h2>South Yorkshire</h2>
</p><p>
<h3>Mayor</h3>
</p><p>
The South Yorkshire mayoralty has grown into a rather powerful position since its establishment in 2018.  Originally it was weak enough that Labour was prepared to let the job be done part-time by an MP, Dan Jarvis.  He handed a rather more beefed-up role in 2022 on to Labour's Oliver Coppard, who polled 43% of the vote against rather split opposition: 17% for the Conservatives, 13% for the Yorkshire Party and 12% for the Greens.
</p><p>
Coppard was originally elected for a four-year term running to 2026, but this has been cut short.  Further devolution to the South Yorkshire Combined Authority means that the mayor is now taking on the role of the South Yorkshire Police and Crime Commissioner Alan Billings, who was most recently re-elected in 2021 with a 54-32 lead over the Conservatives.  Billings is retiring this year, and Coppard's term has been cut short in order to bring South Yorkshire mayoral elections onto the PCC cycle.
</p><p>
<h3>Local elections</h3>
</p><p>
There are elections this year for the whole of Rotherham council and for one-third of the members of Barnsley and Sheffield councils.  There are no council elections this year in Doncaster.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/rotherham21.png" alt="Rotherham, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
<b>Rotherham</b> has a rather small Labour majority.  The 2021 elections here returned 32 Labour councillors, 20 Conservatives, 3 members of the Rotherham Democratic Party, 3 Lib Dems and an independent.  By-elections since then have seen Labour gain two seats, in Aughton and Swallownest ward (from the Conservatives) and in Keppel ward (from the Rotherham Democratic Party); both major parties have had a few councillors leave to become independent, while the Rotherham Democratic Party - the main remnant of the council's once-large UKIP group - has been wound up.  Most of the Conservative seats are in the Rother Valley constituency, so any Labour gains here should lead to tiresome Red Wall-related speculation.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/sheffield21.png" alt="Sheffield, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
By contrast, a messy hung council in <b>Sheffield</b> got even messier over the last term, when eight Labour councillors - including the former council leader Terry Fox - walked out of the party last October.  This has left Labour on 30 seats, one ahead of the Lib Dems on 29; there are also 14 Green councillors, 8 members of the splinter group (the "Sheffield Community Councillors Group"), an ex-Labour independent and a Conservative councillor.  The city's governance arrangements are best described as "it's complicated".  Two of the Sheffield Community Councillors Group and the ex-Labour independent are up for re-election this year.  A repeat of 2023 would see Labour gain one seat net while the Lib Dems gain two, with the Greens going backwards and the Conservatives losing their seat.  </p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/barnsley21.png" alt="Barnsley, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
The Conservatives might also lose group status in <b>Barnsley</b>: they drew a blank in the 2023 Barnsley elections and one of their two elected councillors from 2022 has since walked off to join Reform UK.  Barnsley has a large and secure Labour majority, with the Lib Dems having made gains in recent years to form the main opposition.

<h2>East Midlands</h2>
</p><p>
<h2>Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire</h2>
</p><p>
<h3>Mayor</h3>
</p><p>
Our final new mayoral election is for the grandly-named <b>East Midlands</b> Combined Authority - which does not in fact cover the whole of the East Midlands, but just the counties of Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire together with their namesake cities.
</p><p>
The Conservatives performed well over this combined area in the Johnson era.  In the 2019 general election the 21 constituencies covering those two counties returned 16 Conservative MPs and just five for Labour (the three Nottingham city seats, Derby South and Chesterfield).  Several of those are canonical Red Wall constituencies - including Chesterfield, which did not in the end fall.  In the 2021 local elections the Conservatives gained overall control of Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire county councils, and the combined result of the two Police and Crime Commissioner elections gave the Conservatives a 49-40 lead over Labour.
</p><p>
Fast-forward to the 2023 local elections and things now look very different.  With every district council seat in the two counties up for election, the Conservatives now control only one district in the area: that's Rushcliffe in Nottinghamshire.  Everything else is under Labour majority or minority control, with the exceptions of Derbyshire Dales (a very rural area with a Lib Dem-led coalition in charge) and Ashfield (Zadroznyite).
</p><p>
So, there's a lot of work to do for the Conservatives to win this.  Their candidate is Ben Bradley, who is a busy man: he's currently the leader of Nottinghamshire county council and the Conservative MP for Mansfield.  The Labour candidate is Claire Ward, who was the Labour MP for Watford in Hertfordshire from 1997 to 2010 and now chairs the Sherwood Forest Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.
</p><p>
<h3>Police and Crime Commissioners</h3>
</p><p>
As stated, the two PCCs for the East Midlands mayoral counties were both Conservative gains from Labour in 2021.  These are definitely marginal counties: the Conservatives led Labour in Derbyshire by 49-38 and in Nottinghamshire by 48-43.
</p><p>
Derbyshire - Angelique Foster
Notts - Caroline Henry

<h2>Lincolnshire</h2>
</p><p>
<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>
</p><p>
The Lincolnshire PCC position was very safely Conservative in 2021, with Marc Jones' 60% of the vote was the highest percentage share for any winning PCC candidate that year.  Labour trailed in a long way behind with a second-place score of 20%.
</p><p>
<h3>Local elections</h3>
</p><p>
The only East Midlands district which has retained thirds elections is Lincoln, where one-third of the city council will be up for election together with a county council by-election in Park division.
</p><p>
<h2>Northamptonshire</h2>
</p><p>
Most of Northamptonshire last went to the polls in 2021, when all of the county's elected offices were up at once: the whole of the new North Northamptonshire and West Northamptonshire councils, and the police and crime commissioner election in which the Conservatives' Stephen Mold was re-elected for a second term with a 53-28 lead over Labour.  Mold has proven to be a controversy magnet in office, attracting adverse press in July 2023 over an incident where he appointed Nicci Marzec as the county's interim fire chief, she lasted only ten days and he was forced to deny rumours that they were in a relationship.  In March Mold was effectively forced into a last-minute retirement for making misogynistic comments about Northamptonshire's replacement chief fire officer, Nikki Watson.

<h2>Warwickshire</h2>
</p><p>
<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>
</p><p>
Warwickshire was a safely Conservative county in 2021, with Philip Seccombe returned for a second term as PCC with a 52-28 lead over Labour.
</p><p>
<h3>Local elections</h3>
</p><p>
PCC Philip Seccombe's wife, Izzi Seccombe, has served since 2013 as the leader of Warwickshire county council.  That's not up for election this year, but we can bring you elections for the whole of Nuneaton and Bedworth council and for one-third of Rugby council.
</p><p>

</p><p>
<h2>West Midlands</h2>
</p><p>
<h3>Mayor</h3>
</p><p>
Now we come to our last mayoral contest of the year and one of the most high-profile contests this May: the West Midlands mayoralty.  This has been held since its establishment in 2017 by Andy Street, who is one of the most moderate figures in the current iteration of the Conservative Party.  Perhaps it helps in this regard that Street made his name not as a politician but as a businessman - he was managing director of the John Lewis Partnership before his election - and that in office he has very much kept his distance from the wilder antics of the party.
</p><p>
Street has certainly outperformed the Conservative brand across what would normally be a strongly Labour county.  Even in the 2019 general election Labour won the most parliamentary seats in the West Midlands, 14 to the Conservatives' 13.  So Andy Street can take a lot of personal credit from his re-election in 2021 with a 49-40 lead over the Labour candidate, Birmingham MP Liam Byrne.
</p><p>
After coming close to resigning over the cancellation of High Speed 2 phase 2, Street is now seeking a third term of office as mayor.  Labour have changed tactics after putting up two Birmingham MPs in the last two mayoral elections without success.  Their candidate this time is Richard Parker, a Bengal tiger who was left drifting in the ocean on a lifeboat in the 2001 Yann Martel novel <em>Life of Pi</em> (checks notes) - sorry, this Richard Parker is a former accountant who runs a business "working with SMEs and social enterprises on green investment, housing initiatives and the Birmingham Commonwealth Games".  MORE HERE
</p><p>
<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>
</p><p>
One thing which the new mayor of the West Midlands will <em>not</em> be responsible for is West Midlands Police.  That's not for want of trying.  Andy Street has for some years been trying to merge the mayor and PCC positions, as is being done in South Yorkshire this year; but he had been stymied by opposition from the West Midlands Combined Authority, made up of himself and council leaders from the area, which decided in 2019 not to bring a merger proposal forward.  The police and crime commissioner himself was also against the idea of a merger - and it didn't help that the mayor and PCC were from different parties.  The West Midlands police and crime commissioner, Simon Foster, is a Labour politician: he was elected in 2021 with a 46-39 lead over the Conservatives, at the same time and on the same boundaries as Andy Street's re-election.  Foster's first-preference score of 276,743 votes was the highest for any PCC candidate in 2021, beating the 267,404 votes scored by the Conservatives in the Thames Valley police area into second place.
</p><p>
In October last year a change in the law removed the requirement for the combined authority to consent to a plan for merging the mayoral and PCC position.  Street now saw his chance, and he formally proposed a merger to the Home Secretary who has to sign off the paperwork for this change.  James Cleverly duly wrote to the PCC and the mayor on 6th December 2023 indicating that he would draw up  the appropriate legal order under section 107F of the Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act 2009 and lay it before Parliament for approval.
</p><p>
However, Street and the Home Secretary had been caught out by another change in the law made in October: orders under section 107F are now subject to section 113 of the 2009 Act, which says that the Secretary of State can make such an order only if three conditions are satisfied.  First, the Secretary of State must consider that to do so is likely to improve the economic, social, and environmental well-being of some or all of the people who live or work in the area; second, the Secretary of State must consider that to do is appropriate having regard to the need to secure effective and convenient local government, and to reflect the identities and interests of local communities; and finally, a public consultation has to be carred out.
</p><p>
PCC Foster's solicitors wrote to the Home Secretary pointing all this out, and as a result a public consultation was rather hastily set up which closed at the end of Janaury.  Having considered the submissions, the Home Secretary made a decision on 6th February to merge the Mayor and PCC for the West Midlands.  A draft statutory instrument was drawn up to effect this.
</p><p>
Simon Foster now took the Home Secretary to judicial review.  On 18th March the High Court ruled that the public consultation was inadquate: the consultation document had not given the public enough information to allow for a fair opportunity to participate with the consultation.  Mr Justice Swift accordingly quashed the merger decision.  With only eight days left before notice of election had to be given, the Home Secretary immediately appealed the decision; the Court of Appeal heard the case within the week, but on 22nd March they upheld the High Court's decision.  Notice of election was duly published on 26th March.
</p><p>
So we have a PCC election as well as a mayoral election.
</p><p>
<h3>Local elections</h3>
</p><p>
The mayoral and PCC elections are combined with elections for the whole of Dudley council on new ward boundaries, and for one-third of the councillors in Coventry, Sandwell, Solihull, Walsall and Wolverhampton.  There is also a by-election to cash-strapped Birmingham city council, whose next ordinary elections are due in 2026.
</p><p>
<h2>Staffordshire</h2>
</p><p>
<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>
</p><p>
Staffordshire has often been a happy hunting ground for Conservative election candidates in recent years, and that extended to the 2021 PCC election.  Conservative PCC Benedict Adams was elected in 2021 with a large majority of 57-28 over the Labour candidate.
</p><p>
<h3>Local elections</h3>
</p><p>
There are local elections this year for the whole of Cannock Chase council on new ward boundaries, and for one-third of Tamworth council.
</p><p>
There is also a by-election to Stoke-on-Trent council in the Meir North ward.
</p><p>
<h2>West Mercia</h2>
</p><p>
<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>
</p><p>
The West Mercia police area covers three counties in the Severn and Wye valleys along the beautiful Welsh Marches: Shropshire, Herefordshire and Worcestershire.  Shropshire is geographically large but sparsely populated, and its population was clearly below the threshold for a police force of its own when the current county-based police structure was set up in 1974; Herefordshire had been merged with Worcestershire into a single county by that local government reform, but if it was still separate no doubt the same considerations would have applied.
</p><p>
This is normally a strongly Conservative area of the country, and the 2021 PCC election was a case in point: the Tories' John-Paul Champion lived up to his name by finishing top of the poll, with a 55-24 lead over Labour.
</p><p>
<h3>Local elections</h3>
</p><p>
There are local elections this year for the whole of Redditch and Worcester councils on new ward boundaries.
</p><p>
There is also a by-election to Worcestershire county council in the Evesham North West division.

<h2>Gloucestershire</h2>
</p><p>
<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>
</p><p>
The Conservatives gained the Gloucestershire PCC position in 2021.  Their candidate Chris Nelson had a big lead on first preferences with 41%, with second place hotly contested: the Lib Dems polled 19%, outgoing independent PCC Martin Surl was third with 18% and Labour finished on 16%.
</p><p>

<h2>Avon and Somerset</h2>
</p><p>
<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>
</p><p>
The first two PCC elections for Avon and Somerset returned independent candidate Sue Mountstevens, who didn't seek a third term in 2021.  A rather fragmented picture on first preferences saw the Conservatives lead with 35%, against 24% for Labour, 16% for the Green Party and 13% for the Liberal Democrats.  The Conservative candidate Mark Shelford went on to win the runoff against Labour narrowly.
</p><p>
<h3>Local elections</h3>

<h2>Wiltshire</h2>
</p><p>
<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>
</p><p>
The Wiltshire PCC election of May 2021 was, in terms of the number of voters inconvenienced, the biggest electoral mess of that year.  It was won easily by the new Conservative candidate Jonathan Seed, who polled 41% of the vote against 17% each for the Lib Dems and Labour and 15% for independent candidate Mike Rees.
</p><p>
However, at the time of polling it was not widely known that Seed was disqualified from being a police and crime commissioner due to his criminal record.  He had spent convictions from 1993 for drink-driving and failure to stop at the scene of an accident, for which he was fined Â£500 and disqualified from driving for 18 months by Kennet magistrates.  The maximum penalty for those offences is now six months' imprisonment and an unlimited fine, and these were also imprisonable offences in 1993.  Which meant Seed was ineligible to be a police and crime commissioner: being convicted of any imprisonable offence is a disqualification for that post, whether you actually went to prison or not.
</p><p>
Full marks are due to the investigative team at ITV News for digging up Seed's past, but they didn't get the story out until the interval between polls closing and the votes being counted.  By the time Seed had been declared as the winner by the returning officer, it was clear that he could not take up the post of PCC.  The job was declared vacant when he failed to sign his declaration of acceptance of office within the two-month deadline after the poll.  Jonathan Seed was subsequently charged with making a false statement (that he was not disqualified from office) on his nomination papers; he pleaded not guilty at Oxford Crown Court in November 2021, and the charge was subsequently dropped due to insufficient evidence.
</p><p>
The by-election resulting from all this took place at the awkward time of mid-August 2021, and on the predictable awful turnout the Conservatives' Philip Wilkinson became Wiltshire PCC with 36% of the vote, against 28% for independent Mike Rees and 20% for the Lib Dems.

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>
</p><p>
The Dorset PCC position was won by independent Martin Underhill in 2012 and 2016.  He retired in 2021 and the open seat went to the Conservative candidate David Sidwick, who polled 43% of the vote against 21% for independent candidate Dan Hardy and 14% for the Green Party.
</p><p>
<h3>Local elections</h3>
</p><p>
There are elections this year for the whole of Dorset council, which covers everything in the county outside Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole.  Dorset has an unusual electoral cycle at the moment.   Although it's not technically a county council, its elections are transitioning onto the county council electoral cycle over a 10-year period: so the councillors up for election here are coming off a five-year term and the winners will serve another five-year term to 2029.  This means that Dorset is the last remaining UK council whose members were last elected in the Theresa May era - that's three prime ministers ago.

Our tour of England now crosses to East Anglia where we start by considering the election for Norfolk police and crime commissioner.

The Labour Mayor of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough, Nik Dakin, isn't due for re-election until next year.  Dakin came from behind to win on transfers, but the Conservative PCC for Cambridgeshire Darryl Preston didn't suffer that fate: Preston led on the first round with 43% against 31% for Labour and 23% for the Lib Dems, and he went on to win the runoff 53-47.

Essex is one of the few remaining bright spots for modern Conservatism, and this was reflected in a first-round win for the party in the 2021 PCC election.  Roger Hirst enjoyed a 54-23 lead over Labour then for his re-election.  If anything, this understates the Conservative position given that the English Democrats, who fish for votes in the same general area as the modern Conservative party, polled almost 10%.

<h3>Local elections</h3>
</p><p>
There are elections this year for the whole of Basildon, Brentwood, Castle Point, Epping Forest and Harlow councils where new ward boundaries are being brought in, and also for one-third of Colchester, Rochford, Southend-on-Sea and Thurrock councils.

<h2>Hertfordshire</h2>
</p><p>
<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>
</p><p>
The 2021 Hertfordshire PCC election saw the Conservatives' David Lloyd re-elected.  He was just short of a first-round win, polling 49% in the first round against 27% for Labour and 24% for the Lib Dems.
</p><p>
<h3>Local elections</h3>
</p><p>
There are elections this year for the whole of North Hertfordshire council which is moving off the thirds electoral cycle, the whole of Stevenage council on new ward boundaries, and for one-third of councillors in Broxbourne, St Albans, Three Rivers, Watford and Welwyn Hatfield.
</p><p>
<h2>Bedfordshire</h2>
</p><p>
<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>
</p><p>
This year's election for Bedfordshire PCC could be one to watch.  Bedfordshire surprisingly voted Labour in the first PCC elections in 2012 on a comedy turnout, before being gained by the Conservatives in 2016.  The current incumbent is Festus Akinbusoye, whose position does not look safe on current polling: in 2021 Akinbusoye had 42% of the vote, against 35% for Labour and 13% for the Liberal Democrats.  Mind, he did do relatively well on transfers to win the runoff 54-46.
</p><p>
You can see why PCC Festus Akinbusoye tried to move on to greater things by standing as the Conservative candidate in the Mid Bedfordshire by-election last year, after Nadine Dorries flounced out of Parliament.  But instead of a safe seat on the green benches, he got the unwanted record of being the candidate who squandered the largest majority (in raw votes) ever overturned in a parliamentary by-election.  At least the Conservative loss there spared me from having to write the PCC By-Election Rant again.

<h3>Local elections</h3>
</p><p>
The only local election in Bedfordshire this year is a by-election in the Riverfield ward of Bedford council.

<h2>Thames Valley</h2>
</p><p>
<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>
</p><p>
Like West Mercia, the Thames Valley police area covers three counties: in this case Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire and Berkshire.  These are traditionally strongly Conservative areas, and in 2021 the Conservative candidate Matthew Barber won easily with 42% of the vote against 28% for Labour and 18% for the Lib Dems.  It was a good way to continue a political career: Barber had previosuly been leader of Vale of White Horse council in Oxfordshire, which is now a Tory-free zone.
</p><p>
Surprisingly there is no candidacy from former Thames Valley police DI James Hathaway, who may well have his eyes set on higher political office.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

<h2>Hampshire</h2>
</p><p>
<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>
</p><p>
The Hampshire PCC position was almost a Conservative win in the first round in 2021.  Donna Jones polled 49.8% of the vote against three candidates whose vote split roughly evenly: Labour were second on 19%, the Lib Dems third on 18%.

<h2>Surrey</h2>
</p><p>
<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>
</p><p>
The Conservative vote in traditionally true-blue Surrey seems to have gone into freefall in recent years.  But in PCC terms the party has been underperforming for a long time: the inaugural 2012 election was won by an independent, Kevin Hurley, and in 2021 the Conservatives' Lisa Munro finished top with just 34% of the vote.  21% went to the Lib Dems, 18% to Hurley, 16% to Labour and 12% to the outgoing Conservative PCC David Munro, who unsuccessfully sought re-election as an independent.

<h3>Local elections</h3>
</p><p>
There are elections this year for the whole of Tandridge council on new ward boundaries and for one-third of councillors in Elmbridge, Mole Valley, Reigate and Banstead, Runnymede and Woking.

<h2>Sussex</h2>
</p><p>
<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>
</p><p>
Katy Bourne of the Conserfvatives has been the Sussex police and crime commissioner since the post was set up in 2012.  In 2021 she was re-elected for a third term of office with 47% of the vote, against 19% for Labour and 14% for the Lib Dems.
