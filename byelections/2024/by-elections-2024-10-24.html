<h2>Croft</h2>

East Lindsey council, Lincolnshire; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Sid Dennis.

Now it's time for this column to break new ground, as Andrew's Previews covers the first ever local by-election in a Parliamentary seat which was won at its last election by a Reform UK candidate.  Specifically, that's Richard Tice: he was leader of Reform UK from 2021 until being supplanted by Nigel Farage earlier this year, still serves as the party's deputy leader, and has previous experience in elected office as an MEP for the East of England from 2019 to 2020.  Tice came to politics from a successful business career, in which he ran a number of large property and asset management firms.

So it's slightly disappointing that Reform UK haven't been able to find a candidate for a council by-election in Richard Tice's constituency of Boston and Skegness.  Croft ward covers the sparsely-populated fenland to the south and west of Skegness, and the main road towards Boston and the railway line to Skegness both pass through here.  Thorpe Culvert and Havenhouse railway stations lie within the ward boundary: these stations have a very limited service, and Thorpe Culvert recorded fewer than 400 passengers in the year 2022-23.  Croft itself is the largest parish within this ward but it only has 685 electors on the roll; the ward includes six other parishes to the west, stretching as far as Great Steeping.

This corner of Lincolnshire has an unusually old, an unusually white and an unusually British demographic.  In the 2021 census Croft also made the top 40 wards in England and Wales for detached housing, at 77% of households.  Politically it has been fertile ground for Euroscepticism for a long time, and all of the present Croft ward was within the Wainfleet and Burgh division of Lincolnshire county council which voted for UKIP in 2013.  This division was broken up at the 2017 county elections, with Croft itself now covered by the Skegness South division and the other parishes being part of the Wainfleet county division; both of these were safely Conservative at the last Lincolnshire county council elections in 2021.

East Lindsey council is one of England's largest and most sparsely-populated local government districts, and it had local politics to match with rural independent councillors holding a council majority into the 21st century.  However, the Conservatives took over the council leadership in 2007 and have held it ever since: there is currently a Conservative minority administration after the 2023 council elections returned a hung council.

Croft ward has been in the Conservative column since 2007 and finding candidates to run against the Tories here hasn't always been easy.  In 2011 the ward was a straight fight between the Conservatives and UKIP; while in 2015 the Tories were challenged only by An Independence from Europe, a now-defunct UKIP splinter group associated with former MEP Mike Nattrass whose curious name was a blatant attempt to secure first place on the alphabetical ballot paper for European Parliament elections.  An Independence from Europe's candidate Valerie Pain, wife of Croft ward's by now ex-UKIP county councillor Chris Pain, polled 32.5% here in 2015 which was the party's best-ever score in an actual election.

Croft ward was last contested all the way back in 2019, when new Conservative candidate Sid Dennis was elected with a 64-20 lead over an independent candidate.  Dennis transferred here from St Clement's ward in Skegness, where he had been first elected in 2015; his chicken run proved to be a wise move, as in 2019 St Clement's ward voted in two councillors from the Skegness Urban District Society which wants self-government for the town.  In 2023 nobody stood against Dennis in Croft ward, and he was re-elected unopposed for his final term.  By day Sid Dennis ran the family scrapyard and recycling firm in Skegness; by night he worked as a comedian and after-dinner speaker, and he was a member of the showbusinese fraternity and charity known as the Grand Order of Water Rats until his death in July.

The by-election to replace Sid Dennis has generated a lot of interest.  The defending Conservative candidate is Carl Drury, who is a town councillor in Wainfleet All Saints to the south of the ward and, like Dennis, runs a recycling firm.  Standing as an independent is Paul Collins, who is a Skegness town councillor and was an unsuccessful Labour candidate for East Lindsey council last year.  Also on the ballot are official Labour candidate Mark Anderson, Adrian Findley for the Skegness Urban District Society, Phil Gaskell for the Greens and David Tucker for the Lib Dems.

<h2>Histon and Impington</h2>

South Cambridgeshire council; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Pippa Heylings.

We now move south for our second Lib Dem defence of the week, to arrive in two large villages just to the north of Cambridge.  But in truth, Histon and Impington - although they are still separate parishes - have merged together into a single urban area and they now share a parish council.

Histon and Impington ward has a very educated middle-class demographic these days, but Histon was traditionally an agricultural centre.  Its main employers were Chivers and Sons, who started exporting jam from the village in the 1870s.  By 1900 Chivers were employing over 1,000 people at their canning factory next to Histon railway station, and they were one of the UK's largest manufacturers of preserves.  The business was sold to Schewppes in 1959 and ended up as part of Premier Foods, which built a new Histon factory in the 1980s.  This factory is still very much in operation: now owned by the Hain Daniels Group, it manufactures "a number of the UK's favourite jams, marmalades, jellies, honey, mincemeat, fruit fillings and fruit ingredients, pure and blended maple syrups and natural sweeteners" right here in Histon.

Histon railway station is now part of the Cambridgeshire Guided Busway, which - continuing the fruity theme - continues south-east to Orchard Park.  This consists of housing from the 21st century on the northern edge of the city of Cambridge and is essentially an overspill development of that city, although for the time being it is outside the Cambridge boundary.  Orchard Park declared independence from Impington and became a parish of its own in 2009.

Despite all this population growth over the decades, Histon and Impington ward has survived successive boundary reviews to have unchanged boundaries since at least 1976.  Impington was officially added to the ward name in 2004, but the current name seems to have been in regular use long before then.  The ward had some Liberal and Liberal/SDP Alliance activity in the early 1980s, but then the Liberals gave enough and Histon and Impington became a marginal Conservative v Labour ward in the 1990s.  Labour won it in 1995, 1996 and 1998.

Histon and Impington ward's first Liberal Democrat candidate was Sal Brinton, now Baroness Brinton, who many years later became the party's president and briefly served as acting leader following the defeat of Jo Swinson in 2019.  Brinton finished a poor third here in 1992, and it took ten years for the Lib Dems to win the ward again.  For much of this century Histon and Impington then developed into a close fight between the Lib Dems and independent candidates, with the exception of Conservative wins in 2003 and 2015 when no independent stood.

South Cambridgeshire council came off the thirds electoral cycle and moved to whole-council elections in 2018, and since then Histon and Impington ward has had a full slate of Lib Dem councillors.  The last district elections here were in 2022 when the Lib Dems had 41% against 21% for independent candidate Edd Stonham, 14% for Labour and 12% for the Conservatives.  This Lib Dem score is inflated by a very large personal vote for Pippa Heylings, who ran a long way ahead of her running-mates; indeed the third Lib Dem councillor, who has a Muslim name, was elected rather narrowly.  Since 2017 this ward has had the same boundaries as the Histon and Impington division of Cambridgeshire county council, which last went to the polls in 2021; on that occasion there was no indepenedent candidate and the Lib Dems enjoyed a 57-18 lead over the Conservatives.  South Cambridgeshire council has a Lib Dem majority, while the Liberal Democrats run the county council in coalition with Labour and independent councillors.

Cambridgeshire's strong population growth in recent years resulted in the creation of the St Neots and Mid Cambridgeshire parliamentary seat in July.  This seat, which includes Histon and Impington, voted Liberal Democrat at its first contest: Ian Sollom, a consultant in the energy industry, defeated Anthony Browne who had been the outgoing Conservative MP for South Cambridgeshire.  Browne's old South Cambridgeshire seat also returned a Lib Dem MP, as Pippa Heylings won what was essentially an open seat with a majority of 10,641 votes over the Conservatives.  Heylings, who has become the Lib Dem spokesperson for energy security and net zero, has now stood down from South Cambridgeshire council.

Defending this by-election for the Lib Dems is James Rixon, who is an architect and runs his own archictural firm in Cambridge.  Independent candidate Edd Stonham is back for another go after his runner-up placing in 2022: Stonham sits on the parish council and he was previously a district councillor for this ward from 2010 to 2018, being elected first with the Lib Dem nomination and then as an independent.  Labour have selected William Mason, who is a teacher and union rep.  Standing for the Conservatives is lawyer and property investment expert Clive Pelbrough-Power.  Kathryn Fisher completes the ballot paper for the Green Party.

<h2>Old Dean</h2>

Surrey Heath council; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Lewis Mears.

We now move to another parliamentary seat which the Lib Dems gained in July 2024.  Surrey Heath is now represented in Parliament by Al Pinkerton, who presumably never sleeps: Pinkerton is now the party's Northern Ireland spokesman, and before entering the Commons he was an academic at Royal Holloway specialising in geopolitics.  He took that seat over from the retiring Michael Gove, who was one of the Conservatives' most prominent frontbenchers throughout his 19 years in the Commons.

Al Pinkerton's party also controls Surrey Heath council, which takes its name from the large amounts of heathland in the district.  Much of this is military land, as with the Barossa nature reserve on the Surrey-Berkshire border to the north of Camberley; this is a Site of Special Scientific Interest for its heathland habitat and the associated flora and fauna, and it's also in use by the Army for dry training purposes.  Visitors and resident animals should be prepared for sudden noises.

The military have been in the Camberley area for a long time, and during the Second World War much of Old Dean Common was in use as a camp for the Free French Army.  General de Gaulle was a regular visitor.  After the war the camp was used to intern German prisoners of war, before it was redeveloped in the 1950s and 1960s by Camberley urban district council as a London overspill estate.  Old Dean ward is still 36% socially-rented and in that respect it sticks out like a sore thumb in western Surrey's census return.  The ward also makes the top 30 wards in England and Wales for Buddhism at 2.6% of residents, which may also be linked to the military: the Blackwater Valley urban area, of which Camberley is part, became a favourite location for retired Gurkhas after they gained the right to settle in the UK.

Old Dean ward contains Surrey's largest secondary school, Collingwood College.  Its former pupils include the UK's youngest-ever female murderer Sharon Carr, who killed an adult stranger in Camberley in 1992 while she was a 12-year-old schoolchild.  Carr's 14-year minimum prison term expired in 2011, but she is still considered too dangerous to be let out of HMP Bronzefield.  More wholesomely, Luke and Matt Goss and Craig Logan - the three members of Bros - all met each other as Collingwood College pupils.

The fact that this is a council estate ward has made Old Dean electorally unusual in that it traditionally returns Labour members of Surrey Heath council.  Indeed, in November 2014 Labour successfully defended the ward in a council by-election - something which the party haven't managed to do in the Surrey county council area at any point in the following ten years.  But Labuor's grip on Old Dean ward has slipped over the last decade: the Conservatives gained one seat here in 2015 and the other in 2023, when Old Dean ward voted 59% Conservative and 41% Labour in a straight fight.  The ward is part of the Camberley East division of Surrey county council, which is safely Conservative.

The outgoing Conservative councillor Lewis Mears is a young man who took his A-levels at Collingwood College in 2021, and was then elected to Surrey Heath council two years later as one of its youngest-ever councillors.  Mears graduated from Ravensbourne University London over the summer with a first-class degree in broadcast and media systems engineering, and that industry has given him a job offer which was too good to turn down.  He has now left these shores to work in Hong Kong as a broadcast engineer for Bloomberg.

There will not be a straight fight this time, with five candidates seeking to replace Mears on the council.  Defending for the Conservatives is Catherine Gibbard, who does a lot of community work in th ward.  The Labour candidate Charlie Wilson is even younger than Mears, having taken his A-levels last year; he is the youth, media and communications officer for the party's Surrey Heath branch.  Also standing are independent candidate Tal Belnik, Sam Goggin for Reform UK and Dave Hough for the Liberal Democrats.

<h2>Barton and Becton</h2>

New Forest council, Hampshire; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Keith Craze.

We now come to two wards in Bournemouth or its general area.  Bournemouth and Christchurch were transferred from Hampshire to Dorset at the 1974 reorganisation, but the county boundary stops just before the town of New Milton which remains in Hampshire.  At New Milton's southern end we find Barton on Sea: this lies on a clifftop, with those cliffs being made up of grey and brown clays laid down in the Eocene around 40 million years ago when all this was an inland sea.  These rocks are rich in fossils and are of great interest to palaeontologists, who now recognise a Bartonian age within the Eocene era based on the fossils which are found here.  The Bartonian age is considered to run from 41 million to 37 million years ago.

The human population here is almost as ancient.  In the 2021 census the Barton ward which existed then was ranked number 4 in England and Wales for residents in the 65-84 age bracket (41.1%) and made the top 20 for residents aged 85 or over (8.3%).  Related to this, the ward had the third-highest Christian population in the south-east (61.5%).  Barton was one of 12 wards in England and Wales where an absolute majority of the population were retired (52.5%).  Boundary changes for the 2023 election merged Barton ward with Becton ward, whose demographics aren't quite so extreme but are definitely in the same vein: Becton was in the top 50 wards in England and Wales for its over-85 population (7.4%).

It will not come as a surprise to learn that this area votes strongly Conservative.  The only previous election on the current boundaries was in 2023, when the Conservative slate led the Lib Dems by 53-23 even in a poor Conservative year generally.  Previous election results in this century for the two predecessor wards were entirely consistent with that.  The ward is part of the New Milton division of Hampshire county council which is also safely Conservative.  There are no dinosaur fossils in the Bartonian rocks, but the local Conservative MP - representing the New Forest West constituency since 1997, and easily re-elected in July for his eighth term of office - is Sir Desmond Swayne.

This by-election is to replace Keith Craze, who suddenly passed away in August.  Craze had been a New Forest councillor since 2019, and he was mayor of New Milton in 2021-23; before entering politics he had a 40-year career in HR.  His wife Madalaine is also a New Milton town councillor and she is currently serving as deputy mayor.

The Conservative majority on New Forest council would go down to 25 out of 48 if this by-election is lost, but in the current political climate the local party should feel fairly confident about their chances.  The by-election is a straight fight between two New Milton town councillors, John Adams (retired) for the Conservatives and Wynford Davies (chartered engineer and maritime historian) for the Lib Dems.

<h2>Town</h2>

Monmouthshire council, Gwent; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Catherine Fookes.

We finish for the week in the beautiful Welsh marches.  And don't just take my word for the Wye valley being beautiful: for Monmouth is one of the UK's oldest tourist destinations.  A tourist is literally someone who tours, and the Wye Tour was particularly popular for seekers of the Picturesque during the late 18th and early 19th centuries.  The standard Wye Tour was a two-day boat trip downstream from Ross-on-Wye to Chepstow, with an overnight stay in Monmouth in between.

Today Monmouth town centre is cut off from the Wye by the A40 road, which runs through the Wye valley as a fast dual carriageway link between south Wales and the English Midlands.  The town centre itself is located on low ground between the Wye and Monnow rivers, and it is full of nice-looking and historic buildings.  Monmouth Castle was the birthplace of Henry V in 1386; it was mostly demolished after the English Civil War, and it site was reused for Great Castle House which is now the headquarters of the most senior Army Reserve regiment, the Royal Monmouthshire Royal Engineers (Militia).  The Shire Hall, which celebrates its 300th birthday this year, was used as a court building into the 21st century and was the place where the Chartist leaders of the 1840 Newport Rising were tried and sentenced to be hung, drawn and quartered - a punishment which was subsequently commuted to transportation to Van Diemen's Land for life.  Today the Shire Hall is the offices of Monmouth town council, and the county council have plans to move the town's museum here.

The town centre ends at the Monnow Bridge, which is the last fortified river bridge in Great Britain: it is a mediaeval structure with a gatehouse in the middle of the stream.  Road traffic went through this gate until 2004, when a new road bridge over the Monnnow was built slightly downstream and the Monnow Bridge became a footbridge.  Crossing either the old or new bridge will bring you to the suburb of Overmonnow, which in ancient times was an ironworking centre: the name of Cinderhill Street, referring to the wastage from that industry, is a relic of those times.  Much of Overmonnow is a ward of its own, but the parts close to the Monnow Bridge are covered by Town ward.

In the 2022 census Town ward was in the top 15 wards in England and Wales for population aged 85 or over (8.6%), which may point to the prescence of a number of care homes here given that the rest of the age profile is fairly ordinary.  Only one ward in Wales (Gorllewin Tywyn, on the west coast of Gwynedd) had a higher 85+ figure.

Town ward was created by boundary changes in 2022 which added an extra, fifth, councillor to Monmouth town.  At the previous election in 2017 all four Monmouth wards had voted Conservative, but the Tories performed poorly in the 2022 Monmouthshire county elections and lost their majority; despite polling fewer votes than the Conservatives, Labour became the largest party on the council and formed a minority administration with 22 out of 46 seats.  Three of the Labour councillors represent Monmouth wards, with Town ward returning Labour candidate Catherine Fookes by 46% against 29% for the Conservatives and 19% for an independent candidate.

Monmouth was enfranchised by Henry VIII, but like other Welsh parliamentary boroughs of the time it had to share the right to an MP with other towns in the county.  In 1680 Monmouth tried to elect an MP without involving the other boroughs, which led to legal action that confirmed the electors to be the resident freemen of Monmouth, Newport and Usk and unseated Charles Somerset as the MP.  Somerset was only 18 at the time, but he was the heir to the Duke of Beaufort and there wasn't really a lower age limit for MPs in those days.  Monmouth Boroughs eventually became a pocket borough of the Beaufort family, but this changed with the Reform Acts and the growth of Newport into a major industrial town; the Beaufort strangelehold on the borough was broken in 1831-2 by Liberal MP Benjamin Hall (the Ben who gave his name to the bell Big Ben), while other 19th century MPs for the Monmouth Boroughs included the indsutrialist Crawshay Bailey who, so it is said, had an engine.

In 1918 Monmouth became the center of its own county counstituency.  This is quite right-wing by Welsh standards, and Monmouth is the only constituency to have been by the Conservatives at all six Senedd elections to date.  The current Monmouth MS is the Conservatives' Peter Fox, who took the seat over in 2021 after 13 years as leader of the county council; the previous MS Nick Ramsay, who had been deselected by the Conservatives, sought re-election as an independent and finished in sixth place with a lost deposit.

Monmouth has, however, returned Labour MPs to Westminster: Donald Anderson (now Lord Anderson of Swansea) was the first Labour candidate elected here in 1966, while Huw Edwards (no, not that one) won a 1991 by-election, lost his seat in 1992, returned in 1997 and was re-elected in 2001.  In 2005 Monmouth went back to the Conservatives by electing David T C Davies, who had previously represented the seat in the Welsh Assembly since 1999.  Davies served for nine years as chair of the Welsh Affairs select committee before being appointed to the Whips office by Boris Johnson; he made it to Cabinet in 2022, serving throughout the Sunak administration as Welsh secretary.  David T C Davies then went down to defeat at the 2024 general election, losing an expanded and renamed Monmouthshire constituency to Labour candidate Catherine Fookes by 3,338 votes.

Fookes has now relinquished her Monmouthshire county council seat, so Labour have a by-election to defend in Monmouth's Town ward.  They have seelcted Jackie Atkin, who is the current deputy mayor of Monmouth and works in business development.  She already represents this ward on Monmouth town council, as does the Conservative candidate Martin Newell.  This time there is no independent standing, so completing the ballot paper are Paul Rollins for the Green Party and Jez Becker for the Liberal Democrats.
