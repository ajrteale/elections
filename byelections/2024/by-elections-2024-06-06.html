One by-election on Tuesday 4th June 2024:

<h2>Rhiwcynon</h2>

Powys council, Wales; caused by the resignation of independent councillor Heulwen Hulme.

There are 30 days to go to the general election on 4th July 2024, and there's plenty for Andrew's Previews to discuss before then.  In June 2024 we have 15 council by-elections in the diary plus one piece of unfinished business from last month's ordinary local elections.

To start off we'll come to the centre of Wales and visit the Rhiwcynon electoral division of Powys, which is a very rural area covering four communities to the north and north-west of Newtown.  The name is a portmanteau referring to the Afon Rhiw, a tributary of the Severn which rises here and runs through the north of the division, and to the obscure sixth-century figure of St Cynon.  What little we know of Cynon includes that he was chancellor of the monastery on Bardsey Island; he also reputedly founded and certainly gave his name to the church at Tregynon, the division's largest village.  A later age of religion in this area gave us Llanllugan Abbey, founded in the early thirteenth century and one of only two Cistercian nunneries in Wales; its monastery church survives as Llanllugan's parish church.  The fourteenth-century poet Dafydd ap Gwilym, whose surviving work includes a lot of love poetry, left us one poem called <em>Cyrchu Lleian</em> on the subject of wooing one of Llanllugan's nuns.

Clsoe to Tregynog we find Gregynog Hall, a mansion occupied in the early 19th century by Charles Hanbury-Tracy.  He came from the wealthy Hanbury family which owned the ironworks in Pontypool, and he served for many years as a Whig MP for Tewkesbury in Gloucestershire before entering the Lords in 1838 as the first Lord Sudeley.  Hanbury-Tracy had chaired the commission which gave Charles Barry and Augustus Pugin the job of building the new Palace of Westminster following the disastrous fire of 1834, which makes it curious that when he rebuilt Gregynog Hall shortly afterwards the chosen building material was concrete, painted black and white to make it look like a timber-framed structure.  In 1920 the hall was bought by Margaret and Gwendoline Davies who turned it into an arts centre; Gregynog has hosted a classical music festival on and off since the 1930s, and the concert pianist Llŷr Williams and violinist Enzo Sarici are scheduled to perform there on Saturday.  In 1960 the Davies sisters sold the hall to the University of Wales, who turned it into a conference centre and started a tradition of mathematical and statistical conferences being held at Gregynog Hall.

The Llŷr Williams/Sarici concert on Saturday is in aid of the Council for the Protection of Rural Wales, and electoral wards don't get much more rural than this.  In the 2021 census Rhiwcynon made the top 40 wards in England and Wales for residents employed in agriculture, forestry or fishing (15.7% of the workforce).  More than three-quarters of its households are detached properties.

Rhiwcynon ward is in the centre of Montgomeryshire, the largest of the three sparsely-populated counties which fused together in the 1970s to form Powys.  Montgomeryshire, which is being abolished as a parliamentary constituency this year after 482 years, is the only part of Wales which has never elected a Labour MP: it was a Liberal and then Liberal Democrat stronghold for nearly all of the 20th century, before the antics of MP Lembit Öpik (broke up with his girlfriend to date a Cheeky Girl) and AM Mick Bates (punched a paramedic while drunk), combined with the formation of the Coalition to lead to the Lib Dem vote here falling apart.  Montgomeryshire was gained by the Conservatives in the 2010 Westminster and 2011 Assembly elections, and it's now a safe Tory seat.  Craig Williams, the Prime Minister's parliamentary private secretary, was elected for Montgomeryshire in 2019 after previously representing Cardiff North in the 2015-17 parliament; he is seeking a second term in the redrawn and expanded seat of Montgomeryshire and Glyndŵr, and at the time of writing our genial host's Britain Predicts model has Williams down as the only surviving Conservative MP for Wales in the next Parliament.  We'll see if there's any truth in that in a month's time.

It's only in fairly recent years that party politics became a big feature of local elections in Powys, which was an independent stronghold well into the 21st century.  The 2022 elections here returned quite a balanced council with 24 Lib Dems, 17 independents, 14 Conservatives (nearly all from Montgomeryshire), 9 Labour, 3 Plaid Cymru councillors and one Green.  The Lib Dems and Labour run a coalition administration at County Hall in Llandrindod Wells.

Rhiwcynon ward has returned independent councillors at all five Powys elections this century, but the last two elections here have been hotly contested.  Heulwen Hulme won her first term of office in 2017 at the top of a close three-way split, polling 343 votes against 324 for the Conservatives and 313 for Plaid Cymru.  Things were even closer in 2022 when Hulme held off Plaid Cymru's Ann Jones by just eight votes, 436 to 428; in percentage terms that's 45-44.  Hulme had been Powys council's cabinet member for highways, transport and recycling going into that election; after 2022 she went into opposition as leader of the council's independent group.  She is now retiring from local politics.

No fewer than eight candidates have come forward to succeed Hulme as councillor for Rhiwcynon.  Two of them are independents: Richard Jones is a farmer who lives within the ward at Aberhafesp, while David Markinson is a Llandrindod Wells town councillor who has contested a number of recent Powys council by-elections and got nowhere yet.  Plaid Cymru have reselected Ann Jones after her near-miss here two years ago.  Also standing are Richard Amy for the Liberal Democrats, Oliver Lewis for Reform UK, Rhodri Parfitt for the Greens, Paul Wilkey for Labour and John Yeomans for the Conservatives.

Four by-elections on 6th June 2024:

<h2>Axholme North; and<br>
Brumby</h2>

North Lincolnshire council; caused respectively by the deaths of Conservative councillor John Briggs and Labour councillor Stephen Swift.

Our four polls today are split equally between Conservative and Labour defences, and that's also the case in North Lincolnshire where we have two elections taking place.  One of them is a repeat, because we were in Brumby ward in June 2017 for a by-election which took place on the undercard of the last-but-one general election (<em>Andrew's Previews 2017</em>, page 152).  I described Brumby ward's landscape then as flat and nondescript, which are words I would like to take back: in fact Brumby ward, which covers housing on the western edge of Scunthorpe, lies close to the bottom of a fairly steep slope running down to the Trent floodplain.  Brumby is one of the most working-class corners of Scunthorpe, making the top 50 wards in England and Wales for residents employed in manufacturing (19.8%) and the top 40 wards for adults with 1-5 GCSEs or equiavalent (14.7%).

The road and railway bridge west of Scunthorpe at Keadby was the last fixed-crossing point of the Trent until the Humber Bridge was built.  Travelling over this bridge brings us to the Isle of Axholme, the only significant part of Lincolnshire which lies west of the Trent.  This is not a true island, with the Isle name coming from the old sense of slightly raised ground surrounded by marshland and floodplain.  Much of this was drained in the seventeenth century by the Dutch engineer Cornelius Vermuyden who drastically changed the area's geography; the River Don, which now flows into the Ouse at Goole, originally ran much further south and entered the Trent at Adlingfleet.  Even today the landscape here looks very Dutch.  Axholme forms three wards of North Lincolnshire council, with North ward being based on the market town of Crowle and taking in five more parishes to the north-east -  including Eastoft, which was once located on the River Don.

The main lines of communication here run east-west along the Doncaster-Scunthorpe railway line and the M180 motorway; but Axholme became part of the unloved county of Humberside in 1974, and this has complicated its parliamentary representation.  Until now it has been part of the very awkwardly-drawn Brigg and Goole parliamentary seat; but a major redraw of the Humberside area's constituencies has transferred Axholme into a new seat following the motorway which has the long name of "Doncaster East and the Isle of Axholme".  This is the main successor to the old Don Valley seat, and the previous Don Valley Conservative MP Nick Fletcher is seeking re-election here; the boundary changes significantly improve his position, but <a href="https://sotn.newstatesman.com/2024/05/britainpredicts">our genial host's Britain Predicts model</a> has this seat pegged as a Labour gain at the time of writing.

The parliamentary boundary changes also shore up the Conservative majority in Scunthorpe, which has some Tory-villages to the north of the town moved into the seat.  Scunthorpe was a Conservative gain in 2019 for Holly Mumby-Croft, who defeated the seat's previous Labour MP Nic Dakin at her second attempt; the 2024 election here looks likely to be Round 3 of Mumby-Croft versus Sir Nic, who was knighted in 2020.  Nominations for the 2024 general elections close at 4pm today.

Scunthorpe and a large hinterland, including Axholme and the market town of Brigg, are part of the North Lincolnshire council area which turned in a 27-16 lead for the Conservatives over Labour at teh 2023 local elections - exactly the same score as four years previously.  Other evidence that the Conservative might be holding up relatively well in this area is that the Tories successfully defended the Humberside police and crime commissionership last month.  The Humberside police area is marginal, and Labour will have had high hopes of gaining it.

There should be no drama in these by-elections, both of which fall in safe wards.  In Axholme North the Conservatives had a 58-32 lead over Labour last year, while Brumby ward was a straight fight between the two parties with Labour prevailing by 71-29.

Both by-elections are to replace councillors who have recently died.  Labour councillor Stephen Swift was suddenly taken ill while he was in the middle of a speech during the council's budget meeting in February, and he died two weeks later at the age of 62.  Swift had started his political career on Humberside county council and was on North Lincolnshire council from its commencement in 1996; he lost his seat in Bottesford in 2015, before returning in a by-election for Brumby ward in June 2017.  He had also served as mayor of Bottesford in the past.  John Briggs of Axholme North ward, who passed away in March at the age of 77, was another veteran councillor who had represented the area since 1999; he was the deputy mayor of North Lincolnshire having previously served twice as mayor of the borough, and would have enjoyed a third term as mayor this year had he lived.  Briggs had also previously been deputy leader of the council and served as mayor of Crowle.

Defending Axholme North for the Conservatives is Ian Bint, a former South Yorkshire police officer who serves on Crowle and Ealand town council and runs a PR and marketing company.  Labour have reselected Lara Chaplin, who was runner-up in this ward last year; Chaplin has moved to the area from Gloucestershire in the last few years, and she may be making some trips back down there over the next month because she is also Labour's prospective parliamentary candidate for Cheltenham at the coming general election.  Also standing here is Alan Kelly for the Liberal Democrats.

In Brumby ward the defending Labour candidate is Daniel Hart, who contested the neighbouring Burringham and Gunness ward last year.  The Conservatives' Alan Cook is a Bottesford town councillor who runs a property management firm.  Robin Abram for the Lib Dems and Peter Dennington for the Greens also stand.

<h2>The Nedge</h2>

Telford and Wrekin council; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Leanne Powers.

Our second Labour defence of the week comes in the New Town of Telford.  The Nedge ward is based on three residential areas: Hollinswood immediately to the east of Telford town centre, Stirchley to the south and Randlay in between.  There was a pre-existing village at Stirchley, but essentially this is all New Town development - as is the massive industrial estate of Stafford Park, to the south of the M54 motorway.  The ward name refers to Nedge Hill, a summit which lies on the eastern boundary of teh ward and the borough.

Appropriately given the presence of Stafford Park, this is a ward dominated by manufacturing which is a surprisingly large part of Telford New Town's economy.  The Nedge ward sneaks into the top 100 in England and Wales for residents employed in manufacturing, at 17.8% of adults.

This is one of those areas where local and parliamentary results have been telling different stories in recent years.  The Telford constituency is being defended by the Conservatives next month: the seat's previous MP Lucy Allan won photofinishes here in 2015 and 2017 before winning her third and final term with a large majority in December 2019.  However, Telford and Wrekin council was a Labour gain in the May 2019 local elections and Labour increased their majority in 2023.  At the general election next month the Labour council leader Shaun Davies will take on defending Conservative candidate Hannah Campbell, a former Malvern Hills councillor who stood in Birmingham Selly Oak in December 2019, for the Telford constituency.

Frequent ward boundary changes confuse the issue a bit, but the Conservatives are capable of winning a seat in The Nedge in a good year.  2023 was not a good year, and the Labour slate won here with 52% against 20% for the Conservatives and 12% for independent candidates.

This by-election is to replace Labour councillor Leanne Powers, who submitted her resignation in April just before the end of her first year in office.  Powers had previously been granted leave of absence by February's full council meeting due to caring responsibilities.

Defending for Labour is Corrine Chikandamina, who works for the NHS and is a Great Dawley town councillor.  The Conservative candidate is Richard Tyrrell, who is a parish councillor for Hollinswood and Randlay and works in the IT industry.  Another Hollinswood and Randlay parish councillor on the ballot is independent candidate Sophia Vaughan-Hodkinson, a teacher, who finished last here in 2023.  The Lib Dems' Paul Bryant completes the ballot paper.

<h2>Wellswood</h2>

Torbay council, Devon; caused by the death of councillor Patrick Joyce.

We finish for the week with a ward that juts out into the English Channel a bit.  Wellswood is Torquay's eastern ward, running from the edge of the town centre to a peninsula that terminates in the beauty spots of Hope's Nose and Thatcher Point.  Visitors to the English Riviera can take in the rays at Meadfoot Beach; or, if it hasn't stopped raining yet, take shelter in the showcave of Kent's Cavern from which all sorts of ancient human and animal bones have been excavated.

The local population here is almost as ancient.  Wellswood ward makes the top 50 wards in England and Wales for people aged 65 to 84 (34.6%) and the top 30 wards for people aged 85 or over (7.6%).  A full 43% of adults living in Wellswood are retired.

The ward map here shows something you might not have expected to see in Torquay: the whole of the borough's seaward extent has been included in Wellswood ward.  This is for historical reasons.  Torbay was the very last new county borough to be created before the 1974 local government reorganisation, coming into operation in 1968 as a merger of the borough of Torquay with the urban districts of Paignton and Brixham.  All three of the predecessor councils were also harbour authorities, and in its six years of existence the Torbay county borough council promoted the Tor Bay Harbour Act 1970 to merge the three harbours into one.  Section 5 of the 1970 Act provided that:

"So much of the land within the limits of the harbour ... as is not within the borough shall for all purposes be deemed to be within the borough, the parish of Torquay and the petty sessional division of Torquay and to be within the Torwood Ward."

Torwood ward was renamed in 2003 as Wellswood ward.  And ever since, Wellswood ward has contained the whole of Torbay harbour as well as the peninsula on which its residents actually live.

Torbay council got its independence back from Devon county council in 1998, a year after the Torbay parliamentary seat (which was, and still is, only Torquay and Paignton) was gained by the Liberal Democrats' Adrian Sanders at the 1997 general election.  Sanders defeated the Conservative MP and part-time espionage author Rupert Allason by just twelve votes.  Legend has it that Allason had been to a restaurant in the constituency the night before and pissed off the staff so much that they all resolved to vote against him.  It took until 2015 for the Conservatives to get the Torbay seat back; their representative Kevin Foster, who now has a safe seat, is to seek re-election in July for a fourth term of office as the seat's MP.  Britain Predicts' modelling currently has Foster holding his seat, although with a vote share that's nothing to write home about.

In local government Torbay is clearly a challenging borough to run, with a long history of wild swings in local elections often accompanied by political instability within the council.  This includes a failed experiment with the elected mayoral system.  The Conservatives' Nick Bye won the inaugural mayoral election in October 2005 at a time when the council had a large Lib Dem majority.  The Tories then won the 2007 council election, but Bye subsequently ran into trouble over a conflict of interest relating to the development of land owned by Churston golf club for housing.  He was deselected by the Conservatives for the 2011 mayoral election, stood for re-election as an independent and finished in a strong second place.  Bye and the Conservatives subsequently patched up their quarrel, and he has been a Conservative councillor for Wellswood ward since 2015; Nick Bye now sits in the Torbay council cabinet, with the children's services portfolio.

The new Conservative mayor of Torbay Gordon Oliver was re-elected in 2015 by a narrow margin over the Liberal Democrats.  A 2016 referendum then resolved to abolish his post, and accordingly control went back to the council from 2019.  The 2019 elections returned a hung council with the Conservatives as the largest party, but the Lib Dems took over the leadership in coalition with independent councillors.

In May 2023 the Conservatives took back control of Torbay against the national trend with a small majority, 19 seats against 15 Lib Dems and 2 independents; it was one of only two councils which the Conservatives gained that year, the other being Wyre Forest.  However, the Conservative majority was short-lived, with two of their councillors walking off in October 2023 to form a splinter group called "Prosper Torbay".  One of them was Wellswood ward councillor Patrick Joyce, who subsequently passed away in April just before the end of his first year in office.

Joyce was elected in 2023 on the Conservative slate, which won Wellswood ward then by the wide margin of 61-28 over the Lib Dems.  Prosper Torbay are not registered as a party with the Electoral Commission, and with only one councillor left (Katya Maddison) they will probably lose group status on the council as a result of Joyce' death.  So the Conservatives should probably be favoured to get back the seat which they lost to defection, which would be very helpful for them in running the borough: a Conservative gain here would give them 18 out of 36 seats, or half the council.  The casting vote of the mayor would then be crucial, and Torbay's mayormaking meeting last month - which is usually a formality - had to be adjourned after the Conservative group unexpectedly voted down the expected appointment of Lib Dem councillor Swithin Long.  This means that Mark Spacagna, a Conservative councillor, will remain in the civic chair for the time being.

The Conservative candidate for the Wellswood by-election is Hazel Foster, who is the wife of the outgoing Torbay MP and parliamentary candidate Kevin Foster.  Hazel has previous local government experience as a long-serving councillor in Coventry, where she represented Cheylesmore ward from 2000 to 2016 alongside her husband.  The Lib Dems have selected Peter Fenton - Jesus Christ, Fenton - who gives an address in the ward and works as a management consultant.  Also standing are Jenny Giel for the Green Party, Jonathan Chant-Stevens for Labour, Mike Lister for Reform UK and independent candidate Paul Moor, who also intends to stand in the general election next month as the Workers Party candidate for Torbay.
