<!--One by-election on Tuesday 16th April 2024:
</p><p>
<h2>St Ishmael's</h2>
</p><p>
Pembrokeshire council; caused by the death of independent councillor Reg Owens.
</p><p>
"Call me Ishmael" is one of the great opening lines of English-langauge literature, being the first three words of Herman Melville's classic 1851 novel <em>Moby-Dick</em>.  This was, of course, the story of Captain Ahab, who went half-mad in his quest for vengeance on a white whale, the Mody-Dick of the title, who had bitten off Ahab's leg on an earlier voyage.
</p><p>
Madness upon the seas is not confined to Captain Ahab, of course, and there are a few stories to tell relating to St Ishmael's ward.  This covers a remote corner of Pembrokeshire.  The village of St Ishmaels lies close to the north bank of the Cleddau estuary: it is named not after the biblical Ishmael but after a 6th-century Welsh bishop, Isfael or Ismael.  St Ismael was the bishop of Rhos, an old cantref of Wales which covered this area eventually turned into the Roose Hundred of Pembrokeshire; back in the day, Ismael's see is thought to have been at modern-day St Ishmael's.
</p><p>
The modern-day St Ishamel's ward takes in five other communities in the area and essentially covers the countryside to the west and north of the town of Milford Haven.  Much of this area is within the Pembrokeshire National Park, but that's not necessarily a guarantee of nice countryside.  Milford Haven is located on one of the deepest natural harbours in the world, which makes it particularly well-suited to handling the petrochemicals industry's very largest oil and LNG tankers: accordingly the 20th century saw the development of a number of oil refineries in the town, some of which are located in St Ishmael's ward.  In the 21st century the South Hook oil refinery was redeveloped as a liquified natural gas terminal, handling its first vessel in 2009; a quarter of the UK's gas supply now comes through Milford Haven as LNG, either via South Hook or via the smaller Dragon LNG termainl to the east of the town.  South Hook is partly within St Ishmael's ward; not only that, it's also partly within the Pembrokeshire National Park boundary.
</p><p>
This has not been without consequence for the local wildlife.  The very first oil tanker to unload at Milford Haven, <em>Esso Portsmouth</em> in 1960, created a serious oil spill.  Other mishaps include the wreck of the <em>Sea Empress</em> in 1996, with the resulting major spill taking five years to fully clean up.
</p><p>
The <em>Sea Empress</em> disaster had a major effect on the local birdlife, and there are an awful lot of birds in St Ishmael's ward because the boundaries include a number of islands in the Atlantic.  Closest to the mainland is Skomer, which is home to a large colony of Atlantic puffins - or <em>Fratercular arctica</em>, to give that species its scientific name.  <em>Puffinus puffinus</em> is, as many quizzers know, the scientfic name not for the puffin but for the Manx shearwater - and half of the world's population of Manx shearwater birds live on Skomer.  The nearby island of Skokholm has another 15% of the world's Manx shearwater together with a large storm petrel population.
</p><p>
Further out in the Atlantic is the tiny island of Grassholm, which is owned by the RSPB and is home to 10% of the world's northern gannets.  Grassholm is not quite the westernmost point of Wales, with that title going to the barren rocks on which Smalls Lighthouse stands 21 miles to the west of the Pembrokeshire coast.
</p><p>
Which brings us back to theme of madness upon the seas, as we recall a nasty story from 1801 when the lighthouse keepers on duty at Smalls were Thomas Howell and Thomas Griffith.  They were known to be on poor terms, so when Griffith fell ill and eventually died Howell was justifiably worried that he might be accused of murder.  Forced to keep Griffiths' decomposing body as evidence for the authorities, Howell built a makeshift coffin and tied it to a shelf on the outside of the lighthouse; but the box didn't stand up to the Atlantic winds, and Griffith's arm ended up hanging over the edge of the shelf, from where it could be seen from inside being blown by the wind in a beckoning manner.  When Howell was eventually relieved after three weeks or more of this trauma, he was a broken man: most accounts of the story say that he had been driven mad, and his physical appearance had changed so drastically that his friends didn't recognise him.  Trinity House was forced to act to prevent something like that happening again, and they immediately increased the standard size of lighthouse crews from two to three men.
</p><p>
Today there are no men keeping the light lit on Smalls Lighthouse: it's run remotely from Trinity House's control room in Harwich.  Grassholm, Skomer and Skokholm have no permanent residents, although Skomer has regular ferries to the mainland and a hostel is available on that island for overnight stays.  The Welsh Government has not yet legislated to give the vote to Manx shearwater, puffins, gannets or any of the other birds which call these islands home.  So this election will be decided by the human population of St Ishmael's ward, which makes the top 50 wards in England and Wales for self-employment - a statistic whose highest scores are normally seen in remote rural areas, particularly in rural Wales.
</p><p>
St Ishmael's ward is part of the Preseli Pembrokeshire constituency in the Senedd, which has been represented in Cardiff Bay since 2007 by the Conservatives' Paul Davies.  He was leader of the Welsh Conservatives from 2018 to 2021, when he resigned shortly before the 2021 Senedd election after being seen drinking alcohol on Welsh Parliament premises - at a time when Welsh COVID-19 regulations banned pubs from serving alcoholic drinks.
</p><p>
The forthcoming Westminster boundary changes create a new constituency of Mid and South Pembrokeshire, which will soon be defended for the Conservatives by Stephen Crabb.  Crabb was first elected for Preseli Pembrokeshire in 2005: he served in Cabinet during the Cameron years, with two years as Welsh secretary followed by a few months at the DWP, and he was elected in 2020 as chair of the Welsh Affairs select committee.
</p><p>
Both Preseli Pembrokeshire and Mid and South Pembrokeshire are Conservative veruss Labour fights, but Welsh local elections are a different matter, particularly so in Pembrokeshire.  St Ishmael's ward lies south of the Landsker line and it is a part of the Little England Beyond Wales, where the Welsh language is little used and consequently there is not much support for Welsh speakers' main political champion, Plaid Cymru.  Pembrokeshire is one of two Welsh councils with a majority of independent councillors (the other being Merthyr Tydfil), and St Ishmael's ward is part of that majority.
</p><p>
The outgoing councillor Reg Owens, who died in February at the age of 77 after some years of poor health, had spent 45 years working for the local authority before being elected to the council as an independent member for St Ishmael's ward in 2012.  He had also served several terms as chair of Herbrandston community council within the ward, and spent five years as chair of the Pembrokeshire National Park Authority's planning committee.  Owens was a wheelchair user, and equal opportunities was one of his political passions.
</p><p>
Reg Owens' final re-election in 2022 was with a rather low vote share of 35%, with his main competition coming from other independent candidates: Martyn Cheshire polled 28%, with Claire George coming in third on 25%.  The only recognised party to stand a candidate here last time was the Greens.
</p><p>
We might see a similarly fractured result in this by-election with four independent candidates contesting St Ishmael's.  Janie Harwood stood here this ward in 2022 for the Green Party, coming fourth and last with 11%; Richard Jenkins is the chairman of St Ishmaels Sports Club and vice-chairman of the village's carnival committee; Bob Simister is a Haverfordwest town councillor; and Terry Worsley appears to be fighting his first election campaign.  Again, there is only one political party candidate: Claire George, who finished third here in 2022 as an independent, is back for another go and this time she has the Conservative nomination.

Two by-elections on 18th April 2024:
</p><p>
<h2>Ely West</h2>
</p><p>
East Cambridgeshire council; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Robert Pitt.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/e-cambs-ely-w.png" alt="E Cambs, Ely W" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Last Thursday's column focused on two wards with present or past Lib Dem strength.  This week it's more of the same as we start in the cathedral city of Ely.  This lies next to the River Great Ouse on one of the few areas of high and dry ground in the fens of Cambridgeshire; effectively, Ely was an island next to the River Great Ouse.  The city was originally a religious centre, with the first Ely Abbey being founded in 673 by St Etheldreda (or Audrey, or Æthelthryth), daughter of King Anna of East Anglia.  The modern Ely Cathedral now stands on the site of that abbey, and its size and splendour indicates just how much money there was in the fens in mediaeval times.
</p><p>
While the monks served God within the Abbey, the people of the city without were also looking to make a profit - and their practices for doing this are preserved in our vocabulary.  From the twelfth century an annual seven-day fair was held in Ely around St Audrey (or Etheldreda, or Æthelthryth)'s day on 23rd June.  The Venerable Bede recounted that Æthelthryth (or Etheldreda, or Audrey) had died of a neck tumour; she had worn heavy necklaces in her youth, and she ascribed the tumour to God relieving her of her guilt for such youthful vanity.  Many centuries later, St Audrey's fair became notorious for the sale of tacky necklaces made from brightly-coloured silk.  From this the word "tawdry" - from "St Audrey" - gradually entered the English language, originally to describe the
necklaces themselves as "tawdry lace", and then as a generic word for anything that looks cheap and gaudy.
</p><p>
Following the dissolution of Ely Abbey and its conversion into a cathedral, Ely went into a bit of a decline until the railways came in 1845.  The city is a major railway junction in East Anglia, with lines fanning from here in five different directions - including south to Cambridge.  The recent opening of Cambridge North railway station next to a large science park has made Ely an attractive location for commuters.
</p><p>
From 1889 to 1964 the relatively high ground of the Isle of Ely gave its name to a county, which was one of up to four historic counties (depending on how you count the Soke of Peterborough) which are now part of the modern Cambridgeshire.  Because of this, there was until 1983 an Isle of Ely parliamentary seat.  That was a famous Liberal by-election gain in 1973 following the death of Conservative MP Sir Harry Legge-Bourke (grandfather of the former royal nanny Tiggy Pettifer, as she is now).  Mind, the Lib Dems might now want to forget that given that their winning candidate was the broadcaster, chef, dog food salesman and (it turned out) child sexual abuser Clement Freud, who went on to serve as an MP until 1987.
</p><p>
The name of Ely disappeared from the parliamentary map in 1983, but it will return at the next general election in the form of the Ely and East Cambridgeshire constituency.  This is a redrawn version of the South East Cambridgeshire seat held by the Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer, who enjoyed a large majority in 2019.
</p><p>
This new parliamentary seat has similar boundaries to the area of East Cambridgeshire council, which was one of the few bright spots for the Conservatives in the 2023 local elections: East Cambridgeshire returned 15 Conservative and 13 Lib Dem councillors, exactly the same numbers as in 2019, meaning that the Liberal Democrats fell short of gaining one of their top target councils.  It probably didn't help that the county council, which is run by a Lib Dem-led coalition, had plans at the time to introduce congestion charging for the city of Cambridge.
</p><p>
Seven of the 13 Lib Dem councillors in East Cambridgeshire represent the three wards covering the city of Ely.  Ely West ward takes in the residential western half of Ely, plus an industrial area around the railway station and some open spaces outside the city's bypass.  The large Lancaster Way business park is included in the ward.  The ward is safely Liberal Democrat in local elections, and in 2023 the Lib Dem slate led here with 37% against 23% for Labour and 22% for the Conservatives.  Ely West ward is part of the Ely South county council division, which the Lib Dems gained from the Conservatives in 2021.
</p><p>
This by-election will be defended by the Lib Dems following the resignation of Rob Pitt, who stood down from East Cambridgeshire council and the parish-level Ely city council at the beginning of March.  He was deputy mayor of Ely at the time of his resignation.  Before entering politics Pitt had been a high-ranking military officer who had fought in Iraq and Afghanistan, and served in the Falklands and on counter-violent extremist operations in Africa.  He now works as a consultant to the Ministry of Defence, and in these troubled times Pitt's work has expanded to the point that he no longer has time to satisfy his civic and democratic duties.
</p><p>
Defending for the Lib Dems is somebody who has cabinet expertise, but not in a political sense: Ross Trent is a self-employed cabinet maker who won a by-election to the city council last September in North ward, which is not part of this area.  Labour have selected Adam Wilson, who was on their slate here in May 2023 and lost to Trent in that by-election four months later.  Another returning candidate from 2023 is the Conservatives' David Ambrose Smith, who is hoping to return to East Cambridgeshire council: he was a councillor for Littleport from 2011 to 2023, and he still sits on Littleport town council.  Those are your three candidates.

<h2>Farnham Castle</h2>
</p><p>
Waverley council, Surrey; caused by the resignation of Farnham Residents councillor Heather McClean.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/waverley-farnham-castle-2024.png" alt="Waverley, Farnham Castle" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
We now travel to what might be the archetype of the Surrey commuter town.  Farnham is located on South Western Railway's Alton branch line, with regular trains to London: but it is also close to the Army town of Aldershot which is just over the border with Hampshire, and as such it is very much part of the military-industrial conurbation centred on the Blackwater valley.  The Blackwater Valley towns all run into each other to form a surprisingly large urban area, but this is masked by the fact that the area is administratively divided between Surrey, Hampshire and Berkshire.
</p><p>
The military have been in Farnham for centuries, originally in the form of Farnham Castle which for centuries was a favourite residence of the bishops of Winchester.  One former bishop who lived here in the fifteenth century was Cardinal Henry Beaufort, who is best known for presiding at the trial of Joan of Arc.  Despite being slighted in the Civil War the castle did see some military use afterwards, as  in the Second World War it was a centre for training artists in military camouflage.  Today Farnham Castle is a venue for weddings, training, conferences and other events, and in 1974 a South African exile called Thabo Mbeki was married here: many years later, he would go on to succeed Nelson Mandela as president of his country.
</p><p>
There was a Farnham parliamentary constituency from 1918 to 1983, when the seat was redrawn with the new name of South West Surrey.  The latter seat has returned three successive Conservative Cabinet ministers to parliament: Maurice Macmillan until his death in 1983, then Virginia Bottomley until her retirement in 2005, and the present Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt since then.
</p><p>
Hunt will be the last MP for South West Surrey, which is being split into two new seats by the Boundary Commission.  He is seeking re-election in Godalming and Ash, but rather more of his former electors will go into a completely new constituency called Farnham and Bordon which will straddle the Surrey-Hampshire border.  The Conservatives' Farnham and Bordon branch have selected Gregory Stafford, brother of the Rother Valley MP Alexander Stafford, as their next parliamentary candidate: Gregory currently sits on Ealing council in London where he led the Conservative group from 2014 to 2022, and he works in the NHS as director of a clinical improvement programme.
</p><p>
Farnham and Bordon should be a safe Conservative seat for Gregory Stafford even given the party's current dire polling and their awful recent form in Surrey local elections.  Farnham is the largest town in the Waverley district where the Conservatives are now the third-largest group on the council: the 2023 elections here returned 22 Lib Dem councillors, 13 Farnham Residents, 10 Conservatives, 2 Labour (one of whom is the former Nottinghamshire MP Nick Palmer), 2 independents and 1 Green.  A coalition administration of everybody except the Conservatives and Lib Dems is running the show.  The Lib Dems are one down at the moment following the death of councillor Andrew Law in January; his seat has actually been vacant longer than this one in Farnham Castle, but the local Lib Dems have delayed that by-election until 2nd May when there will be a county-wide poll for Surrey police and crime commissioner.
</p><p>
As this column has recounted on two previous occasions, the Farnham Residents have been the main party in Farnham's local elections for some time now.  They won one of Castle ward's two seats in 2015, gained the other from the Conservatives at a by-election in 2016 (<em>Andrew's Previews 2016</em>, page 162) and then held a further by-election two years later (<em>Andrew's Previews 2018</em>, page 184).  On revised boundaries for the 2023 election, the Farnham Residents had a 50-35 lead over Labour in the town-centre Farnham Castle ward.  The Residents also hold the Farnham Central division on Surrey county council.
</p><p>
The Farnham Residents will have to defend this by-election, the third here in eight years, following the resignation of their councillor Heather McClean in March.  McClean was in her first year of office, having topped the poll in Farnham Castle ward in 2023.  The reason for McClean's resignation was not publicised, but it looks likely to be work-related because she took up a new job as an academic at UCL at the same time.
</p><p>
Defending for the Farnham Residents is Alan Earwaker, who is the mayor of Farnham and already represents this ward on the town council.  Labour have reselected John Gaskell, who was runner-up here in 2023 and is unhappy with proposed long-term roadworks in the town centre.  Also standing are Aly Fitch for the Conservatives and Theresa Meredith-Hardy for the Lib Dems - last year there was an electoral pact between the Lib Dems and the Farnham Residents, but clearly this has now broken down.
