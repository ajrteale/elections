In the film <em>Miss Congeniality</em>, a contestant in a beauty contest describes her perfect date as "April 25th, because it's not too hot, not too cold. All you need is a light jacket".  The Great British Weather might well have other ideas on that one, but for the electors of Grangetown ward in Cardiff 25th April 2024 is very much an imperfect date for a by-election.  It's only next week that they will be called out to vote again, for the South Wales Police and Crime Commissioner.  Why are the voters and the returning officer having to go through this two weeks in a row?
</p><p>
Well, the answer to that would appear to be Voter ID, a recent reform by the Westminster government which - unusually among electoral reform measures in the UK - raises barriers to voting by requiring all polling station voters to show photographic ID.  Voter ID applies to UK parliamentary elections, all elections in England and Northern Ireland, and to Police and Crime Commissioner elections in England and Wales.  It does not apply to devolved or local elections in Wales or Scotland, because these are devolved matters and the Senedd and Scottish Parliament, to date, have not seen the point of implementing such a reform.
</p><p>
Now, running simultaneous elections on two different franchises is not actually that unusual.  The local government franchise is wider than the UK parliamentary franchise: members of the House of Lords, certain foreign nationals and 16- and 17-year-olds in Scotland and Wales cannot vote for parliament but can vote in local elections.  When parliamentary and local elections are combined, as happened widely at each general election from 1997 to 2010, then the electoral register which you will see printed out on the presiding officer's table at your polling station will have special marks to identify people who should only be given a local election ballot paper.
</p><p>
In Scotland and Wales, nobody has yet tried to combine an election which requires voter ID with an election that doesn't.  To date the only election in Scotland or Wales which has required voter ID to be shown was the Rutherglen and Hamilton West parliamentary by-election last year.  But that will change next week when elections are held across Wales for the country's four Police and Crime Commissioners.  There has clearly been guidance given to Welsh returning officers that they are not to combine local elections with any poll which requires voter ID, which has led to some funny business going on with Welsh local by-election dates recently.  One assumes that when the Cardiff returning officer received a request to hold a by-election in Grangetown division, this was the only date available once 2nd May had been ruled out.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/cardiff-grangetown.png" alt="Caerdydd, Grangetown" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Grangetown is a heavily industrial area to the south-west of Cardiff city centre, between the River Taff to the east and the River Ely to the west as they both drain into Cardiff Bay.  Here can be found the Cardiff International Sports Village at the southern end of the division, while much of the west of the division is occupied by the large Leckwith Industrial Estate or the Canton railway depot.  The Grangetown area itself lies on the west back of the Taff, close to the city centre.
</p><p>
By Welsh standards this area has a very diverse population makeup.  Grangetown has the most mixed-race residents (5.7%) and the most Hindu residents (4.2%) of any ward in Wales, together with the country's second-highest black population (10.8%) and third-highest Muslim population (28.6%), and third-highest proportion of residents born in Africa (7.1%).
</p><p>
Which makes it appropriate that the local member of the Senedd is the first black politician to lead any European country: that's Zambian-born Vaughan Gething, who was elected as First Minister of Wales last month and has served since 2011 as MS for Cardiff South and Penarth.  Before Gething was elected to Cardiff Bay he represented it from 2004 to 2008 as the Cardiff councillor for Butetown ward, on the other side of the Taff from here.  The Westminster seat of the same name as Gething's constituency was won in a 2012 by-election by Labour's Stephen Doughty who is currently a shadow junior Foreign Office minister; he will seek re-election for a redrawn version of Cardiff South and Penarth soon.  Both Gething and Doughty have safe Labour seats.
</p><p>
Recent ward boundary changes in Cardiff left Grangetown ward with unchanged boundaries, but increased its representation from three councillors to four to reflect recent population growth.  This was a Liberal Democrat ward while the party were running the city back in the noughties, but by the time this column visited in November 2016 the Lib Dem vote had dwindled away and Grangetown was a Labour versus Plaid Cymru battle.  Plaid Cymru narrowly won that by-election, but subsequent local elections in 2017 and 2022 went to Labour.  In 2022 Grangetown became a safe Labour ward with the party's slate beating a joint Plaid Cymru and Green Party ticket by 53-28.  This makes it part of the Labour majority on Cardiff council: the 2022 elections returned 55 Labour councillors, 11 Conservatives, 10 Lib Dems, 2 Plaid and 1 councillor for the pro-independence party Propel.
</p><p>
This by-election follows the sudden death in February of Labour councillor Abdul Sattar, at the early age of 53.  He ran a corner shop within the ward.  His council career peaked in 2022-23 when he was deputy Lord Mayor of Cardiff, the first councillor of Pakistani heritage to hold that position.
</p><p>
Defending this by-elections for Labour is Abdul's widow Waheeda Sattar.  The "Common Ground" electoral alliance of Plaid Cymru and the Green Party within Cardiff is continuing and they have jointly nominated Kirstie Kopetzki.  Also standing are Zak Weaver for the Conservatives, James Bear for the Lib Dems, Sash Patel for Propel and two independent candidates, Ahmed Abdi Samater and Andrew Horvord.

<h2>Arbroath West, Letham and Friockheim</h2>
</p><p>
Angus council, Scotland; caused by the resignation of independent councillor David Fairweather.
</p><p>
We now move to Scotland, where there are no scheduled local elections this year: the next Scotland-wide poll will be the next Westminster election.  So there are no issues with the returning officer for Angus calling a poll here today.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/angus-arbroath-w-letham-friockheim.png" alt="Angus, Arbroath W/Letham/Friockheim" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Since the introduction of PR in 2007 the town of Arbroath has been split between two wards which also extend well into the town's rural hinterland.  Arbroath West here means west of the railway line, so this ward does not include the town centre or the historic bits.  Letham (pronounced with a short E) lies ten miles to the north-west of Arbroath and describes itself as the largest village in Angus.
</p><p>
Friockheim (pronounced "Freek-ham") was added to this ward by boundary changes in 2017.  It has a curious etymology based on the Gaelic word for "heather" and the German word for "home", the latter added at the request of Flemish weavers who had settled in the newly-founded village in the early nineteenth century.  The name of Friockheim was first proclaimed in an advertisement printed in Arbroath on 22nd May 1824, so in a sense this year is the village's 200th anniversary.  Most of the ward's acreage is agricultural, but the boundaries also include the military base of RM Condor just outside Arbroath which is home to 45 Commando Royal Marines.
</p><p>
The county of Angus is traditionally one of the strongholds of the Scottish National Party, who represent the area at both Westminster and Holyrood level.  The local MSP is Graeme Dey, who has represented Angus South since 2011: he is a junior minister in the Yousaf government, with the higher and further education and veterans' portfolios.  Boundary changes for the next Westminster election will transfer Arbroath into a constituency called Arbroath and Broughty Ferry, which is in fact the successor to the current Dundee East; following the retirement of Stewart Hosie, this will be contested for the SNP by the former North East Fife MP and current St Andrews University professor Stephen Gethins.
</p><p>
The Scottish National Party are also the largest party on Angus council, running a minority administration with 13 out of 28 seats.  In opposition are 7 Conservatives, 6 independents and 1 Labour plus this vacant seat left behind by the retirement of former council leader David Fairweather who had represented this ward in 2007.  Fairweather had stood for Holyrood in 2011, coming very close to saving his deposit as an independent candidate in Angus South.
</p><p>
If we take the 2007-17 Arbroath West and Letham as the predecessor to this ward, then since 2007 three of the four council seats here have been held by the Conservatives, the SNP and Fairweather.  The fourth seat has alternated between the Lib Dems and the SNP, although the Lib Dem win in 2017 was a fluke caused by the Conservatives polling two quotas but only having one candidate.
</p><p>
Fairweather's win in 2022 was rather flukish as well, as he polled only 8% of the first preferences and was in sixth place for much of the count.  The SNP candidates polled 36%, the Conservatives 31% and another independent candidate, Ian Wren, started the count in fourth place on 9%.  Fairweather eventually got ahead of Wren on the seventh count thanks to Labour transfers; Wren was eliminated just three votes behind, and his transfers put Fairweather over the second Conservative candidate to win the final seat.
</p><p>
A rerun of the 2022 votes for a single seat gives a narrow SNP win over the Conservatives by 2,678 votes to 2,545, so we have here another good chance for the SNP to finally break their duck and win an election in the Humza Yousaf era.  That hasn't happened yet, and there have been plenty of opportunities for the party to win <em>something</em> over the last year's by-elections.
</p><p>
No independent candidate has come forward to succeed David Fairweather, so we have a free-for-all, I repeat we have a free-for-all!  The SNP candidate Kathleen Wolf is chair of the party's Westminster campaign committee.  The Conservatives have gone to the next generation by selecting 24-year-old Jack Cruickshanks, who is a student reading financial economics at Dundee University.  Also standing are Mark Hilton for Labour, Sandra O'Shea for the Lib Dems and Mark Findlay for the Scottish Greens.  Votes at 16 and the Alternative Vote apply here; counting will take place on Friday morning.
