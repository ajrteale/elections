<h2>Ascot and Sunninghill</h2>

Windsor and Maidenhead council, Berkshire; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor John Story.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNgsAcSJdAg

We're in the second week of October, and it's time for Andrew's Previews to go to Berkshire for the first time in 2024.  Mind, we're a bit late for the traditional social occasion of the year: the five-day Royal Ascot race meeting, which is traditionally attended by the Royal Family and features millions of pounds in prize money.  Charles and Camilla aren't as obsessive about the gee-gees as the late Elizabeth II was, but the King and Queen do normally have a few horses running at Royal Ascot - last year they even had a winner.  Ascot's most valuable race - the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes - is actually held at a separate meeting in July, while in two days' time racegoers can attend the British Champions Day, the finale to the Flat racing season with a prize fund of £4 million.

Which might be enough to buy you a house in Ascot, if you're lucky.  This is a very expensive and desirable place to live, and Ascot and Sunninghill ward definitely has a commuter demographic with its half-hourly trains to Waterloo.  The presence of a number of boarding schools here means that Ascot and Sunninghill ward is in the top 70 wards in England and Wales for residents aged 16 or 17.  One year-round employer here is Heatherwood Hospital, a minor NHS unit; this is a new building, with the previous Heatherwood Hospital - a filming location for <em>Carry On Matron</em> - currently being redeveloped for new housing.

The local authority here is Windsor and Maidenhead council, which returned a Liberal Democrat majority in 2023; but the party only have a majority of one seat, and they have chosen to form a grand coalition with the main localist independent group to give strong and stable government to the borough.  The Tories, who ran Windsor and Maidenhead council for many years until 2023, are now down to just six councillors plus this vacancy.  Five of the seven Conservatives returned last year represent one of the two wards in the Ascot and Sunningdale area, which is cut off from the rest of the borough by Windsor Great Park and some bizarre local government boundaries; but such was the scale of the Tory rout here last year that even Ascot and Sunninghill ward turned in a marginal result with 40% for the Conservatives, 31% for the Lib Dems and 15% for Labour.  The three Conservative councillors returned here were called Asghar Majeed, Julian Sharpe and John Story.  There are no prizes for guessing which one of those candidates was a long way behind the other two and scraped into the final seat by the skin of their teeth.

Despite that outbreak of casual racism from the electorate, Ascot had a black MP until quite recently - although Adam Afriyie apparently preferred to consider himself as "post-racial".  Afriyie represented the Windsor constituency from 2005 to 2024, when he retired from the Commons following the collapse of his business empire: he had been declared bankrupt in December 2022 on a petition by HMRC, with debts of £1 million to the taxman and £700,000 to Barclays.  In the old days, bankruptcy would have diqualified Afriyie from the Commons immediately, and who knows what might have happened in the resulting by-election; these days insolvents are allowed to stay in elected office unless they behave so badly that they end up with a bankruptcy restrictions order slapped on them.  The Windsor constituency was taken over in July by new Conservative MP Jack Rankin, who worked in the energy markets before entering Parliament; he enjoyed a comfortable majority of 6,457 votes.  Rankin lives in Ascot and Sunninghill ward, and he has signed the nomination papers for the Conservative candidate in this by-election.

This by-election is defended by the Conservatives after long-serving councillor John Story stepped down last month on health grounds.  Story had been first elected to the council in an April 2006 by-election for the predecessor ward of Sunninghill and South Ascot, and he was mayor of the borough during the Platinum Jubilee year of 2022-23.

Defending for the Conservatives is Sally Coneron, who is a business owner - her exporting and manufacturing firm featured on <em>Dragon's Den</em> - and chairman of the governors at St Michael's primary school in Sunninghill.  One former pupil of that school is George Jezard, who is the Lib Dem candidate.  Labour have selected Nigel Hayward, who contested the neighbouring Sunningdale and Cheapside ward last year.  Completing the ballot paper is Matt Newman for the curiously-capitalised "the Borough first", who are the Lib Dems' main coalition partners on the council.

<h2>Tirymynach</h2>

Ceredigion council, West Wales; caused by the death of Liberal Democrat councillor Paul Hinge.

There are two by-elections taking place today in rural Wales.  We'll start on the west coast with the Tirymynach ward of Ceredigion, which covers a number of villages just to the north of Aberystwyth.  The largest settlement in the ward is Bow Street on the main road and railway line towards Machynlleth; Bow Street railway station was reopened in 2021 to serve the village.  Bow Street is unusual in Ceredigion in having an English-language name, which appears to have been lifted directly from the central London thoroughfare of that name.

The ward also takes the smaller settlement of Llangorwen to the west and the coastal village of Clarach, which has been more or less swallowed up by large caravan parks for holidaymakers.  Clarach Bay has a sandy beach, which is crossed by the small Afon Clarach on its way to the ocean.  Further up the coast is the curious feature of Sarn Gynfelyn, a natural causeway which extends 11 kilometres into the sea.  Geographers will tell you that this is the remains of a glacial moraine from the last Ice Age.  Legends, on the other hand, have it that this causeway is a relic of the kingdom of Cantre'r Gwaelod, which now lies beneath the waters of Cardigan Bay.

Ceredigion is one of the four Welsh local government districts which are controlled by Plaid Cymru, all of which are predominantly rural areas with significant numbers of Welsh speakers.  Plaid also represent the Ceredigion Senedd constituency which has same boundaries as the county, although the MS Elin Jones has had a non-partisan role since 2016 as the Senedd's Llywydd, or presiding officer.  Plaid Cymru MP Ben Lake was elected for Ceredigion in 2017 and won a third term of office in July, very easily winning the expanded constituency of Ceredigion Preseli.

Lake had gained his seat in 2017 from the Liberal Democrats, who are now the third-largest group on Ceredigion county council behind the Plaid majority and the independent councillors.  The Lib Dems are defending this by-election following the death of Paul Hinge in August, at the age of 69.  Hinge was chairman of Ceredigion council in 2021-22, and he was the county's Armed Forces Champion having previously served in the Royal Welch Fusiliers; in 2022, Hinge travelled to the Falkland Islands to mark the 40th anniversary of their liberation.  He had represented Tirymynach ward since 2008 and nobody opposed him at his last re-election in 2022; the last time Hinge faced a contest was in 2017, when he defeated the Plaid Cymru candidate by 56-44 in a straight fight.

There is no unopposed return this time with six candidates being nominated for the Tirymynach by-election.  Defending for the Liberal Democrats is Gareth Lewis, who lives within the ward at Clarach.  As does Jonathan Evershed, a "politico" and "recovering academic" according to his social media, who works as a researcher and is the Plaid Cymru candidate.  Also standing are James Cook for Labour, Harry Hayfield for the Greens, Jack Parker for Reform UK and Ethan Terry for the Conservatives.

<h2>Llanberis</h2>

Gwynedd council, North Wales; caused by the resignation of Plaid Cymru councillor Kimberley Jones.

Our other Welsh by-election today takes in place in the heart of Parc Cenedlaethol Eryri, or as English speakers know it, the Snowdonia National Park.  The village of Llanberis lies just under five miles north of Yr Wyddfa, and it is the most common starting point for those who want to climb the mountain - either by foot on the Llanberis Path, or by rail via the Snowdon Mountain Railway.

The Llanberis electoral ward doesn't extend to the summit of Yr Wyddfa, but it does take in most of the Llanberis Path and some summits over 1,000 metres: Snowdon's lower summit of Garnedd Ugain is on the ward boundary, as is the highest point of Glyder Fawr on the north side of the Pass of Llanberis.  This valley runs down to the village of Nant Peris, the ruins of Dolbadarn Castle which was built in the 12th century by Llywelyn the Great, and to the lakes of Llyn Peris and Llyn Padarn either side of Llanberis village.  Llyn Peris, the higher and smaller of the two lakes, is the lower reservoir feeding the massive Dinorwig hydroelectric power plant, and its water level varies a lot depending on the time of day: water flows into Llyn Peris from a higher reservoir at times of peak power demand, and is then pumped back up the mountain when there is excess power in the National Grid.

Llanberis is a strongly Welsh-speaking village.  Indeed the website of Llanberis and Nant Peris community council apologises that "not all the information on this website is available in English at present", which is a refreshing change.  It thus should be no surprise that it is represented at all three levels of government by Plaid Cymru.  In the Senedd, Plaid's former co-deputy leader Siân Gwenllian MS has one of the safest seats in Wales: her Arfon constituency is based on Bangor and Caernarfon.  At Westminster elections, Llanberis was added in 2024 to the Dwyfor Meirionnydd constituency which is represented by Plaid's Westminster group leader Liz Saville Roberts.  Plaid Cymru have a large overall majority on Gwynedd council, and since 2022 Llanberis has been part of that majority: outgoing councillor Kim Jones was elected here that year with 60% of the vote against 32% for an independent candidate.  Before 2022, Llanberis had voted for independent councillors this century.

Defending this by-election for Plaid Cymru is Gwilym Evans, who is a Llanberis and Nant Peris community councillor.  There is one independent candidate standing, Martin Jones, who lives in the village of Cwm y Glo further down the valley: he was a Labour candidate for Cwm y Glo ward in the 2017 Gwynedd elections.  Also standing are Dewi Evans who has the Welsh-only ballot paper description "Plaid Werdd Cymru" (for the uninitiated, that's the Green Party of Wales), and local resident Anne Williams for the Liberal Democrats.
