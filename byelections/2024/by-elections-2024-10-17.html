Sixteen by-elections on 17th October 2024:
</p><p>
<h2>Aylesford and East Stour</h2>
</p><p>
Ashford council, Kent; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Sojan Joseph.
</p><p>
We have another Super Thursday to bring you today with eight seats defended by Labour, five by the Liberal Democrats, two by the Conservatives and one by Plaid Cymru.  There is something for everyone to enjoy this week, with polls in all three nations of Great Britain and quite a lot of picturesque countryside to enjoy.  Which makes a refreshing change, because writing Andrew's Previews can sometimes feel like an endless tour of nondescript suburbs.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/ashford-aylesford-e-stour.png" alt="Ashford, Aylesford/E Stour" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Which brings us to South Willesborough, an old village in Kent which has been swallowed up by the growth of the town of Ashford.  This is covered by the Aylesford and East Stour ward, named after two watercourses which pass through the ward: the River East Stour (which joins the Great Stour near Ashford town centre) and the Aylesford Stream.  Originally the main source of employment here would have been the South Eastern Railway's locomotive works, which were built in the 1840s at the north-west corner of the ward; today the business parks next to Ashford's ring road, the Bad Munstereifel Road, also contribute to the local economy.
</p><p>
This two-seat ward was created in 2019 by merging the previous single-member wards of South Willesborough and Aylesford Green.  The latter ward was politically volatile, and its five elections between 2003 and 2015 returned five different councillors from four different parties: the Conservative win, in a November 2015 by-election, was with just 23.5% of the vote in a spectacularly fragmented result.  South Willesborough consistently voted for independent and/or localist councillors during this period, and the first election for the present ward in 2019 was won easily by the Ashford Independents party.  But in 2023 fragmentation returned to the ward: Labour topped the poll with 32%, the Green Party came second with 29% and the Ashford Independents fell to 25%, with Labour and the Greens winning one seat each.  The Green win built on their local success in the 2021 Kent county council elections, where they gained the Ashford East county division from the Liberal Democrats.  Ashford council has been hung since 2022, and the 2023 election returned 19 Conservative councillors, 11 Labour, 9 Ashford Independents and 8 Greens; the Ashford Independents have taken the council leadership and formed a minority coalition administration with the Greens.
</p><p>
The Labour councillor elected here in 2023 was Sojan Joseph, who was born in the Indian state of Kerala and came to Ashford to work as a mental health nurse.  In July 2024 he went on to greater things by becoming the first ever Labour MP for Ashford.  The previous Conservative MP Damian Green, who had represented the seat since 1997, had served as a cabinet minister under Theresa May before being sacked just before Christmas 2017 following a sex and pornography scandal, and then chaired the One Nation caucus of Conservative MPs.  Green had seen the writing on the wall, and he unsuccessfully tried to do the chicken run by applying for the Conservative nomination in the new Weald of Kent constituency: instead, he went down to defeat in Ashford by 1,779 votes.
</p><p>
Sojan Joseph has resigned his Ashford council seat giving a tricky Labour defence, which falls to Reena Mathew: she was Joseph's running-mate in this ward last year, finishing as runner-up ten votes behind the Green councillor.  The Greens have also selected their unsuccessful candidate here from last time: Thom Pizzey, a graphic designer for an education services company, polled just 10 votes in the November 2015 Aylesford Green by-election but the party have put a lot of work in here since then.  Interestingly the Greens' coalition partners, the Ashford Independents, are not standing; so the ballot paper here is completed by Jac Wood for the Conservatives, Brian Collins for Reform UK and Alexander Coxall for the Lib Dems.

<h2>Belvedere</h2>
</p><p>
Bexley council, London; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Daniel Francis.
</p><p>
We now come to two more Labour defences in areas which were historically part of Kent, like Ashford, but which were transferred into Greater London in the 1960s.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/bexley-belvedere.png" alt="Bexley, Belvedere" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
I promised you a lot of picturesque wards coming up this week, and here have a ward whose name promises much on that front.  The word "belvedere" comes from Italian, in which it literally refers to a "beautiful view"; in the English language a belvedere is a building or structure situated to command such a view.  The belvedere in Belvedere, which no longer stands today, was a wooden tower erected in the mid-19th century to command the view from what was then the open space of Lessness Heath.  It was built by the landowner Sir Culling Eardley, 3rd Baronet, who was briefly a Whig MP for Pontefract in 1830-31 and spent much of his life campaigning for religious freedom: he stayed in the Church of England all his life, but was a long way down its evangelical wing.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/geograph-7198179-by-Marathon.jpg" alt="Lesnes Abbey" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Such religious views would no doubt have been anathema to the monks of Lesnes Abbey, which was founded in 1178 by Richard de Lucy, Henry II's chief justiciar: it took its name from the ancient Little and Lesnes hundred of Kent, which took in what is now the northern part of Bexley borough together with adjoining parts of Greenwich borough.  Lesnes Abbey never made it to the Dissolution, being closed down in 1525 because it had fewer than seven monks; its remains are preserved as a park.  The neighbouring Lesnes Abbey Woods have survived since ancient times: they have given their name to Abbey Wood railway station, which is the south-eastern terminus of the Elizabeth Line and lies at the north-west corner of this ward.  Belvedere proper is further east along the North Kent railway line, within a bend of the Thames estuary: the riverside area is given over to industrial units, with the ward's housing occupying higher ground to the south.
</p><p>
The local authority here is the London Borough of Bexley, which has had a Conservative majority since 2006 and has a long-serving leader: Teresa O'Neill has led the council since 2008, and in 2022 she was awarded a peerage as Baroness O'Neill of Bexley.  Bexley and Bromley is the safest Conservative seat in the London Assembly, and all four of its previous AMs have gone on to become Conservative MPs including recent failed leadership candidate James Cleverly, who represented the two boroughs from 2008 to 2016.  In 2024 the losing Labour candidate for Bexley and Bromley, Kevin McKenna, went on to become Labour MP for Sittingbourne and Sheppey two months later; he defeated Conservative candidate Aisha Cuthbert, who was so convinced she was going to win Sittingbourne and Sheppey that she actually resigned her seat on Bromley council in advance of the general election.  I hope she had a Plan B in mind.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2022/bexley22.png" alt="Bexley, 2022" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
However, Conservatism isn't a major factor in this particular corner of Bexley.  The borough's Labour vote is concentrated at its northern, Thames-side end in wards like Belvedere, which are part of the Erith and Thamesmead constituency.  This is a safe Labour seat which has been represented since 2019 by Abena Oppong-Asare, the chair of the Labour Women's Network.  In the 2022 Bexley council elections Labour defeated the Conservatives in Belvedere ward by 53-33.
</p><p>
This by-election is to replace long-serving Labour councillor Daniel Francis after he was elected in July as Labour MP for Bexleyheath and Crayford.  Francis was first elected for Belvedere ward in a 2000 by-election, served until 2010 when he tried to move to a different ward without success, and then returned to Belvedere ward in 2014.  This column previously mentioned Francis in December 2021, when he was the Labour candidate for the Old Bexley and Sidcup parliamentary by-election.
</p><p>
Defending this by-election for Labour is Jeremy Fosten, who is a lawyer training to become a barrister; he fought Falconwood and Welling ward in the 2022 Bexley council elections.  The Conservatives have reselected Christine Bishop, who was a rather distant runner-up in this ward two years ago.  Also standing are Sarah Barry for the Green Party, David McBride for the Liberal Democrats and Michael Pastor for Reform UK.

<h2>Eltham Town and Avery Hill</h2>
</p><p>
Greenwich council, London; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Sammy Backon.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/greenwich-eltham-tn-avery-hill.png" alt="Greenwich, Eltham Tn/Avery Hill" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Lesnes Abbey Woods lies on the Green Chain Walk, a series of signposted walking routes which link together a number of parks and open spaces in south-east London.  Travelling a few miles south-west along the Green Chain brings us to two more open spaces, Eltham Palace and Avery Hill Park.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/geograph-7775317-by-Marathon.jpg" alt="Eltham Palace" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
These have rather different histories.  Eltham Palace was a royal residence in the 14th, 15th and 16th centuries, and its Great Hall still retains its mediaeval hammerbeam roof.  In 1400-01 it hosted the only Byzantine emperor ever to visit England, Manuel II Palaiologos, with a jousting tournament taking place in his honour; in 1499 an 8-year-old Henry VIII met Erasmus here.  Much of the present Eltham Palace buildings are 1930s Art Deco built for the then owners Stephen and Virginia Coulthard, but they didn't live here very long; the Coulthards left during the Second World War and Eltham Palace became the HQ of the Royal Army Educational Corps, leading to the place being bombed by the IRA in 1990.  It is now open to the public under the auspices of English Heritage, and it is a popular location for filming.
</p><p>
There is also an educational connection with Avery Hill.  Avery Hill House was built in the 19th century for John North, a Yorkshireman who had emigrated to Chile in 1865 and built up a large business empire.  He became a very rich man following Chile's win in the 1879-84 War of the Pacific, ending up with an effective monopoly on nitrate fields which Peru ceded to Chile at the end of that war; North's other business interests included South Wales coal, with his investments leading to rapid population growth in Maesteg, together with a stake in Congolese rubber with all the human rights abuses that implied.  North died in 1896, by which time the Chilean Civil War had caused his business empire to collapse, and in 1902 Avery Hill House was bought by the London County Council which turned it into a teacher training college.  The mansion ended up as part of the University of Greenwich, which still has a campus on Avery Hill but is now moving out of the house itself; current plans are that the mansion will be turned into a secondary school, while the massive Victorian Winter Garden will be taken over by the council.
</p><p>
The northern and southern boundaries of this ward are two of the three railway lines between Charing Cross and Dartford: Eltham railway station, at the ward's north-west corner, is on the Bexleyheath line while New Eltham station, on the southern boundary, is on the Dartford Loop line.  The ward overall has a lower middle-class demographic and a rather low non-white population by London standards.
</p><p>
Eltham has been the centre of a parliamentary seat since 1983, and the MP here since 1997 has been Labour backbencher Clive Efford.  He needed to gain his seat all over again at the last general election, after the Boundary Commission's addition of Chislehurst to his constituency wiped out his majority, but Efford was re-elected comfortably enough for his eighth term of office.  This was despite a good Conservative by-election performance in his constituency during the general election campaign: the Tories held a Greenwich council seat in June in the marginal Mottingham, Coldharbour and New Eltham ward.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2022/greenwich22.png" alt="Greenwich, 2022" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
That ward borders Eltham Town and Avery Hill which turned in a rather similar result at the last Greenwich council elections in 2022: 40% for Labour, 37% for the Conservatives and 12% for the Greens.  Labour won two seats and the Conservatives took the other.  The Labour slate consisted of Sammy Backon, Lauren Dingsdale and Raja Zeeshan; there are no prizes for guessing which one of those candidates was a long way behind the other two and lost out on a seat.
</p><p>
This by-election is to replace Sammy Backon, who was first elected for this ward in 2022; he missed the announcement of his result at the count because he was on shift as an NHS nurse.  Backon is moving out of London to take up a new job.  Labour are trying to keep it in the NHS with the selection of Chris McGurk as their defending candidate: he is a GP.  The Conservatives' Charlie Davis comes here hotfoot from the general election campaign, in which he was their losing Parliamentary candidate for Eltham and Chislehurst: Davis is seeking to return to Greenwich council, on which he represented the former Eltham North ward from a 2016 by-election until 2022.  Mark Williams, who was the Green candidate here in 2022, is standing again.  Also on the ballot are Kieran Edwards for the Lib Dems, Ruth Handyside for Reform UK and independent candidate Arnold Tarling, who also stood for the Eltham and Chislehurst parliamentary seat in July: he finished in seventh place with 0.7%.

<h2>Royston Palace</h2>
</p><p>
North Hertfordshire council; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Chris Hinchliff.
</p><p>
From Eltham Palace we now move north to consider Royston Palace.  The town of Royston lies at the crossing point of the prehistoric Icknield Way (east-west) and the Roman Ermine Street (north-south).  The Icknield Way here was the traditional boundary between Hertfordshire and Cambridgeshire, which meant that Royston was divided between the two counties until it was placed entirely within Hertfordshire in 1896.  The old crossroads is undermined by the Royston Cave, an artificial underground space with mediaeval carvings on the walls, whose origin is lost to history.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/geograph-7677074-by-Colin-Park.jpg" alt="Royston Palace" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Just to the north of the crossroads lay the Palace which gives its name to this ward.  Royston Palace is one of the more unusual royal residences of the past, being essentially a series of town-centre houses.  The Palace was developed by and became a favourite residence of James I, who had passed through Royston in 1603 while on his way to London to take up the English crown: he thought that the countryside around the town would be excellent for hunting, and Royston Palace became his hunting lodge and general hideaway.  After James' death in 1625 Royston passed out of royal favour, and the Palace was sold off during the Commonwealth years; the Old Palace itself is now a private residence, while some of the other royal buildings are still in use by town-centre businesses.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/n-herts-royston-palace.png" alt="N Herts, Royston Palace" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Palace is the central of Royston's three electoral wards, covering the north of the town between the Old North Road (which follows the Roman Ermine Street) and the more modern main road towards Cambridge.  The present boundaries are brand-new, drawn up for the 2024 election to North Hertfordshire council.  This returned a hung council with 25 Labour councillors, 19 Lib Dems and 7 Conservatives; Labour, who had a coalition agreement with the Lib Dems before that election, now run a minority administration.  North Hertfordshire has now moved off the thirds electoral cycle, and its next election will be held in 2028.
</p><p>
Royston Palace has returned councillors from all three main parties in recent years, but in recent years Labour have been in the ascendancy here.  Labour gained the ward's two seats from the Conservatives in 2022 and 2023, and the Labour councillors Catherine Brownjohn and Chris Hinchliff were re-elected in May comfortably enough: shares of the vote were 38% for Labour, 25% for the Conservatives and 24% for the Lib Dems.
</p><p>
At Hertfordshire county council level Royston is divided between two divisions which combine the town with rural territory: Palace ward is part of the Royston East and Ermine county division which was safely Conservative in the 2021 county elections.  We see a similar story at Parliamentary level, where Royston is part of the North East Hertfordshire constituency which also contains Labour-voting Letchworth and a large amount of Tory-voting countryside, which normally sets the tone at general election time.  Sir Oliver Heald, who served as Solicitor General in the Coalition government, served for 32 years as Conservative MP for North East Hertfordshire and its predecessor seats before he retired in 2024.  His former seat was then gained in July by Labour councillor Chris Hinchliff, who defeated the Conservatives' Nikki da Costa by the narrow margin of 1,923 votes.  Da Costa, who previously worked in 10 Downing Street as a special adviser to both Theresa May and Boris Johnson, had also been an unsuccessful candidate in the 2024 North Hertfordshire council elections two months previously.
</p><p>
Chris Hinchliff MP has now resigned his old seat on North Hertfordshire council, and the defending Labour candidate in the Royston Palace by-election is Sarah Lucas: she is a finance director for a local company and does voluntary work for victims of domestic abuse and homelessness.  The Conservative candidate Callum Bartram-Bell has a degree in politics and international relations, but his day job is working with horses as a stud hand.  The Lib Dems have reselected Gill Lewis who also stood here in May. Also standing are John Froggett for Reform UK and Peter Wilkin for the Green Party.

<h2>Harpenden North and Rural</h2>
</p><p>
St Albans council, Hertfordshire; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Beth Fisher.
</p><p>
Our second Hertfordshire by-election is also in a rural constituency which slipped out of the Conservatives' grasp in July.  Harpenden and Berkhamsted was a new constituency created by the boundary review, which very comfortably returned the Lib Dem candidate Victoria Collins by a majority of 10,708 votes.
</p><p>
This reflects a general Lib Dem takeover of local government in western Hertfordshire.  The constituency takes in territory from the Dacorum and St Albans local government districts: St Albans council, which covers Harpenden, now has a massive Liberal Democrat majority while Dacorum council was gained by the party in 2023.  If the Tories can't get their act together by next May, then the Conservative majority on Hertfordshire county council could be in jeopardy.
</p><p>
Mind, winning elections is one thing but actually governing is another.  The Lib Dems have recently lost their majority in Dacorum after the ruling group split amid bullying allegations.  St Albans, on the other hand, seems to keep generating by-elections for me to write about.  This one is to replace Lib Dem councillor Beth Fisher, who was first elected only in May and stood down in September after just four months in office.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/st-albans-harpenden-n-rural.png" alt="St Albans, Harpenden Rural" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Fisher's ward was Harpenden North and Rural, whose name is pretty much what it says on the tin: here we have the northern quarter of the affluent commuter town of Harpenden together with the Harpenden Rural parish to the east of the town.  Harpenden Rural parish is part of the county council division of that name, which the Lib Dems gained from the Conservatives in a by-election last December.  Much of that parish's acreage is given over to agricultural research: Rothamsted Research has been here since the 1840s, helping to feed the world by developing better agricultural methods, better plants, better herbicides and pesticides, and indeed better statistical methods to try and make sense of the results of their experiments.  Rothamsted Research supports around 350 scientists, with most of its funding coming from Defra and other government bodies.  In the 2021 census Harpenden North and Rural was in the top 50 wards in England and Wales for higher managerial and professional occupations (32.4%), and over 60% of its workforce is educated to degree level or higher.
</p><p>
The St Albans Liberal Democrats, who have generated a bit of controversy with their recent proposal to introduce charges for on-street parking in St Albans and Harpenden, are defending a 54-31 lead over the Conservatives with their candidate James Robertson: he is a director of a programme seeking to improve the wellbeing of young people.  The Conservatives have selected Sue Griffiths, who was previously an unsuccessful candidate for St Albans council in 2021 and 2022.  Also on the ballot are Ross Harper for Labour and Mario May for the Green Party.

<h2>Ascot and Sunninghill</h2>
</p><p>
Windsor and Maidenhead council, Berkshire; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor John Story.
</p><p>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vggkPaw2bY
</p><p>
<blockquote>
Every duke and earl and peer is here,<br>
Everyone who should be here is here.<br>
What a smashing, positively dashing<br>
Spectacle: the Ascot opening day.
</p><p>
At the gate are all the horses<br>
Waiting for the cue to fly away.<br>
What a gripping, absolutely ripping<br>
Moment at the Ascot opening day.
</p><p>
&mdash; Lerner and Loewe, <em>Ascot Gavotte</em>
</blockquote>
</p><p>
We're in the second week of October, and it's time for Andrew's Previews to go to Berkshire for the first time in 2024.  Mind, we're a bit late for the traditional social occasion of the year: the five-day Royal Ascot race meeting, which is traditionally attended by the Royal Family and features millions of pounds in prize money.  Charles and Camilla aren't quite as obsessive about the gee-gees as the late Elizabeth II was, but the King and Queen do normally have a few horses running at Royal Ascot - last year they even had a winner.  Ascot's single most valuable race, the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes, is actually held at a separate meeting in July; while in two days' time the course will host the British Champions Day, the finale to the Flat racing season with a prize fund of £4 million.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/windsor-maidenhead-ascot-sunninghill.png" alt="Windsor/Maidenhead, Ascot/Sunninghill" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Which might be enough to buy you a house in Ascot, if you're lucky.  This is a very expensive and desirable place to live, and Ascot and Sunninghill ward definitely has a commuter demographic with its half-hourly trains to Waterloo.  The presence of a number of boarding schools here means that Ascot and Sunninghill ward is in the top 70 wards in England and Wales for residents aged 16 or 17.  One year-round employer here is Heatherwood Hospital, a minor NHS unit; this is a new building, with the previous Heatherwood Hospital - a filming location for <em>Carry On Matron</em> - currently being redeveloped for new housing.
</p><p>
The local authority here is Windsor and Maidenhead council, which returned a Liberal Democrat majority in 2023; but the party only have a majority of one seat, and they have chosen to form a grand coalition with the main localist independent group to give strong and stable government to the borough.  The Tories, who ran Windsor and Maidenhead council for many years until 2023, are now down to just six councillors plus this vacancy.  Five of the seven Conservatives returned last year represent one of the two wards in the Ascot and Sunningdale area, which is cut off from the rest of the borough by Windsor Great Park and some bizarre local government boundaries; but such was the scale of the Tory rout here last year that even Ascot and Sunninghill ward turned in a marginal result with 40% for the Conservatives, 31% for the Lib Dems and 15% for Labour.  The three Conservative councillors returned here were called Asghar Majeed, Julian Sharpe and John Story.  There are no prizes for guessing which one of those candidates was a long way behind the other two and scraped into the final seat by the skin of their teeth.
</p><p>
Despite that outbreak of casual racism from the electorate, Ascot had a black MP until quite recently - although Adam Afriyie apparently preferred to consider himself as "post-racial".  Afriyie represented the Windsor constituency from 2005 to 2024, when he retired from the Commons following the collapse of his business empire: he had been declared bankrupt in December 2022 on a petition by HMRC, with debts of £1 million to the taxman and £700,000 to Barclays.  In the old days, bankruptcy would have disqualified Afriyie from the Commons immediately, and who knows what might have happened in the resulting by-election; these days insolvents are allowed to stay in elected office unless they behave so badly that, like Boris Becker, they end up with a bankruptcy restrictions order slapped on them.  The Windsor constituency was taken over in July by new Conservative MP Jack Rankin, who worked in the energy markets before entering Parliament; he enjoyed a comfortable majority of 6,457 votes.  Rankin lives in Ascot and Sunninghill ward, and he has signed the nomination papers for the Conservative candidate in this by-election.
</p><p>
This by-election is defended by the Conservatives after long-serving councillor John Story stepped down last month on health grounds.  Story had been first elected to the council in an April 2006 by-election for the predecessor ward of Sunninghill and South Ascot, and he was mayor of the borough during the Platinum Jubilee year of 2022-23.
</p><p>
Defending for the Conservatives is Sally Coneron, who is a business owner - her exporting and manufacturing firm featured on <em>Dragon's Den</em> - and chairman of the governors at St Michael's primary school in Sunninghill.  One former pupil of that school is George Jezard, who is the Lib Dem candidate.  Labour have selected Nigel Hayward, who contested the neighbouring Sunningdale and Cheapside ward last year.  Completing the ballot paper is Matt Newman for the curiously-capitalised "the Borough first", who are the Lib Dems' main coalition partners on the council.   A positively thrilling racecard.

<h2>Rodbourne Cheney</h2>
</p><p>
Swindon council, Wiltshire; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor William Stone.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/swindon-rodbourne-cheney.png" alt="Swindon, Rodbourne Cheney" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
We now travel west to reach Swindon, which has grown to become by far the largest settlement in Wiltshire.  Swindon was a very small place until it was selected by the Great Western Railway as the ideal site for their locomotive works.  Rodbourne Cheney ward, which takes its name from an old parish incorporated into Swindon in 1928, starts immediately north of Swindon's intercity railway station and runs north-west through the Rodbourne and Moredon areas; also here is the large Cheney Manor industrial estate.
</p><p>
This is a working-class ward which normally votes Labour in local elections.  The current ward boundaries date from 2012, and the only time the Conservatives have won the ward in that time is in 2021 when they swept 16 out of Swindon's 21 wards.  Since then the town's electoral pendulum has swung hard to the left, and Labour gained the ward from the Conservatives in May by 54-33.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2024/swindon24.png" alt="Swindon, 2024" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Labour now have a large majority on Swindon council and hold both of the town's parliamentary seats.  Rodbourne Cheney is part of the key marginal Swindon North constituency, where Conservative MP Justin Tomlinson went down to defeat this year by 4,103 votes.  The new Labour MP for Swindon North is Will Stone, an Army veteran who ran a Brazilian jiu-jitsu gym; he was elected to Swindon council in 2022 for Rodbourne Cheney ward before making the step up to Parliament in July.  Stone has now relinquished his Swindon council seat.
</p><p>
Defending the resulting by-election for Labour is Meural Cardoso, who describes herself as a "young, committed and hands-on individual".  Sudha Sri Nukana, the Conservative councillor who lost her seat here in May, wants it back.  In fact all three losing candidates from May are back for another go, as also standing are the ward's regular Green candidate Roderick Hebden, Ciaran Skinner for the Lib Dems and new face Alex Petrarche as an independent candidate: she is a behavioural scientist working in healthcare.

<h2>Tirymynach</h2>
</p><p>
Ceredigion council, West Wales; caused by the death of Liberal Democrat councillor Paul Hinge.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/ceredigion-tirymynach.png" alt="Ceredigion, Tirymynach" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
There are two by-elections taking place today in rural Wales.  We'll start on the west coast with the Tirymynach ward of Ceredigion, which covers a number of villages just to the north of Aberystwyth.  The largest settlement in the ward is Bow Street on the main road and railway line towards Machynlleth; Bow Street railway station was reopened in 2021 to serve the village.  Bow Street is unusual in Ceredigion in having an English-language name, which appears to have been lifted directly from the central London thoroughfare of that name.
</p><p>
The ward also takes the smaller settlement of Llangorwen to the west and the coastal village of Clarach, which has been more or less swallowed up by large caravan parks for holidaymakers.  Clarach Bay has a sandy beach, which is crossed by the small Afon Clarach on its way to the ocean.  Further up the coast is the curious feature of Sarn Gynfelyn, a natural causeway which extends 11 kilometres into the sea.  Geographers will tell you that this is the remains of a glacial moraine from the last Ice Age.  Legends, on the other hand, have it that this causeway is a relic of the kingdom of Cantre'r Gwaelod, which now lies beneath the waters of Cardigan Bay.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/geograph-845252-by-Dave-Croker.jpg" alt="Sarn Gynfelyn" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Ceredigion is one of the four Welsh local government districts which are controlled by Plaid Cymru, all of which are predominantly rural areas with significant numbers of Welsh speakers.  Plaid also represent the Ceredigion Senedd constituency which has same boundaries as the county, although the MS Elin Jones has had a non-partisan role since 2016 as the Senedd's Llywydd, or presiding officer.  Plaid Cymru MP Ben Lake was elected for Ceredigion in 2017 and won a third term of office in July, very easily winning the expanded constituency of Ceredigion Preseli.
</p><p>
Lake had gained his seat in 2017 from the Liberal Democrats, who are now the third-largest group on Ceredigion county council behind the Plaid majority and the independent councillors.  The Lib Dems are defending this by-election following the death of Paul Hinge in August, at the age of 69.  Hinge was chairman of Ceredigion council in 2021-22, and he was the county's Armed Forces Champion having previously served in the Royal Welch Fusiliers; in 2022, Hinge travelled to the Falkland Islands to mark the 40th anniversary of their liberation.  He had represented Tirymynach ward since 2008 and nobody opposed him at his last re-election in 2022; the last time Hinge faced a contest was in 2017, when he defeated the Plaid Cymru candidate by 56-44 in a straight fight.
</p><p>
There is no unopposed return this time with six candidates being nominated for the Tirymynach by-election.  Defending for the Liberal Democrats is Gareth Lewis, who lives within the ward at Clarach.  As does Jonathan Evershed, a "politico" and "recovering academic" according to his social media, who works as a researcher and is the Plaid Cymru candidate.  Also standing are James Cook for Labour, Harry Hayfield for the Greens, Jack Parker for Reform UK and Ethan Terry for the Conservatives.

<h2>Llanberis</h2>
</p><p>
Gwynedd council, North Wales; caused by the resignation of Plaid Cymru councillor Kimberley Jones.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/gwynedd-llanberis.png" alt="Gwynedd, Llanberis" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Our other Welsh by-election today takes in place in the heart of Parc Cenedlaethol Eryri, or as English speakers know it, the Snowdonia National Park.  The village of Llanberis lies just under five miles north of Yr Wyddfa, and it is the most common starting point for those who want to climb the mountain - either by foot on the Llanberis Path, or by rail via the Snowdon Mountain Railway.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/geograph-3047211-by-Kevin-Williams.jpg" alt="Castell Dolbadarn" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
The Llanberis electoral ward doesn't extend to the summit of Yr Wyddfa, but it does take in most of the Llanberis Path and some summits over 1,000 metres: Snowdon's lower summit of Garnedd Ugain is on the ward boundary, as is the highest point of Glyder Fawr on the north side of the Pass of Llanberis.  This valley runs down to the village of Nant Peris, the ruins of Dolbadarn Castle which was built in the 12th century by Llywelyn the Great, and to the lakes of Llyn Peris and Llyn Padarn either side of Llanberis village.  Llyn Peris, the higher and smaller of the two lakes, is the lower reservoir feeding the massive Dinorwig hydroelectric power plant, and its water level varies a lot depending on the time of day: water flows into Llyn Peris from a higher reservoir at times of peak power demand, and is then pumped back up the mountain when there is excess power in the National Grid.
</p><p>
Llanberis is a strongly Welsh-speaking village.  Indeed the <a href="https://cyngorllanberis.cymru/">website of Llanberis and Nant Peris community council</a> apologises that "not all the information on this website is available in English at present", which is a refreshing change.  It thus should be no surprise that it is represented at all three levels of government by Plaid Cymru.  In the Senedd, Plaid's former co-deputy leader Siân Gwenllian MS has one of the safest seats in Wales: her Arfon constituency is based on Bangor and Caernarfon.  At Westminster elections, Llanberis was added in 2024 to the Dwyfor Meirionnydd constituency which is represented by Plaid's Westminster group leader Liz Saville Roberts.  Plaid Cymru have a large overall majority on Gwynedd council, and since 2022 Llanberis has been part of that majority: outgoing councillor Kim Jones was elected here that year with 60% of the vote against 32% for an independent candidate.  Before 2022, Llanberis had voted for independent councillors this century.
</p><p>
Defending this by-election for Plaid Cymru is Gwilym Evans, who is a Llanberis and Nant Peris community councillor.  There is one independent candidate standing, Martin Jones, who lives in the village of Cwm y Glo further down the valley: he was a Labour candidate for Cwm y Glo ward in the 2017 Gwynedd elections.  Also standing are Dewi Evans who has the Welsh-only ballot paper description "Plaid Werdd Cymru" (for the uninitiated, that's the Green Party of Wales), and local resident Anne Williams for the Liberal Democrats.

<h2>Bredbury Green and Romiley; and<br>
Cheadle West and Gatley</h2>
</p><p>
Stockport council, Greater Manchester; caused respectively by the resignations of Liberal Democrat councillors Lisa Smart and Tom Morrison.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/stockport-bredbury-grn-romiley.png" alt="Stockport, Bredbury Grn/Romiley" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
We now return to England to consider two of Greater Manchester's suburbs, which are located within the borough of Stockport.  To the west of Stockport town we have Cheadle West and Gatley ward, which lies immediately south of the M60 motorway along the A34 road and the railway line to Manchester Airport; Gatley railway station is located on that line.  Bredbury Green and Romiley lie east of Stockport town on the far side of the Goyt valley; Romiley railway station is a junction on the Hope Valley line, with regular trains into Manchester city centre by a choice of two routes assuming that Northern can be bothered to run them.  Both of these wards are strongly middle-class areas, and in the 2021 census Cheadle and Gatley ward (the predecessor to Cheadle West and Gatley) just sneaked into the top 100 wards for Judaism.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/stockport-cheadle-w-gatley.png" alt="Stockport, Cheadle W/Gatley" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Here we have two more by-elections caused by newly-elected MPs leaving their council seats behind, but this time Labour are not a factor.  The Cheadle parliamentary seat has existed since 1950, and strong population growth meant that it was split into two seats in 1974: the western half kept the name Cheadle, while the eastern half (including Bredbury Green and Romiley) became the Hazel Grove constituency.  For many years these seats have been closely fought between the Conservatives and the the Lib Dems or their predecessors: the radio doctor Michael Winstanley represented both seats as a Liberal in the 1960s and 1970s, and both seats voted Lib Dem from 1997 to 2010 and again in 2024.
</p><p>
In Hazel Grove Lisa Smart, who is now the Lib Dems' home affairs spokesperson, was elected in July at her fourth attempt following three consecutive losses to Conservative MP William Wragg.  Wragg, who chaired the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs select committee for most of the 2019-24 Parliament, had already announced that he would retire from the Commons some time before he resigned the Conservative whip in April 2024 following a bizarre scandal: he was the victim of a honeytrap operation on Grindr, and had the contact details of several other Conservative MPs blackmailed out of him.  The Conservatives actually fell to third place in Hazel Grove in July 2024, with Lisa Smart's majority of 6,500 being over Labour.  The Lib Dems' new Cheadle MP Tom Morrison was elected at his second attempt, defeating Conservative backbencher Mary Robinson by 12,235 votes, and he is now the Lib Dems' deputy chief whip.
</p><p>
Morrison and Smart both leave behind safe Lib Dem wards on Stockport council.  Tom Morrison was first elected in 2019 for Cheadle Hulme North ward, before transferring to the safer Cheadle West and Gatley ward in 2023 following ward boundary changes; he was re-elected in May with a 57-20 lead over Labour.  Lisa Smart had represented Bredbury Green and Romiley since 2016 and was next due for re-election in 2027; in May the Lib Dems enjoyed a 59-19 lead over the Conservatives here.  The Lib Dems are the largest party on Stockport council which they run as a minority: the latest composition has 28 Lib Dem councillors plus three vacancies against 23 Labour and 3 councillors each for the Edgeley Community Association, the Green Party and the Heald Green Ratepayers.  Following the loss of their two parliamentary seats in July, there is no longer a single Conservative elected representative in Stockport.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2024/stockport24.png" alt="Stockport, 2024" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Defending Bredbury Green and Romiley for the Lib Dems is Rachel Bresnahan who founded and runs the Cherry Tree Project, a youth hub in Romiley.  The Conservatives have reelected Pat Bentley: she was runner-up here in 2023 and 2024.  Also standing are Papa Andoh-Kweku for Labour and Stephanie Wyatt for the Green Party.
</p><p>
In Cheadle West and Gatley the defending Lib Dem candidate is Huma Khan: she teaches at a primary school in Manchester.  Labour have selected Dan Farley, a financial analyst who is fighting his first election campaign.  This ballot paper is completed by Michael Fox for the Conservatives and Alexander Drury for the Green Party.

<h2>Holme Valley South</h2>
</p><p>
Kirklees council, West Yorkshire; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Paul Davies.
</p><p>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/61/Black_Hill_%28Peak_District%29.jpg" alt="Black Hill" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
We now commence a tour of some of the picturesque parts of northern England by climbing up into the spine of the Pennines.  Although the summit of Black Hill is hard to describe as picturesque, consisting of bare black peat with no vegetation growing on it.  Black Hill is the highest point of West Yorkshire at an elevation of 1,909 feet, and its ascent - an early climb on the Pennine Way - was notorious for its boggy conditions until flagstones were laid.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/kirklees-holme-valley-s.png" alt="Kirklees, Holme Valley S" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Black Hill lies on the boundary between West Yorkshire and Derbyshire, and its northern and eastern flanks descend into the slopes and villages of the Holme Valley.  This is the countryside which came into our living rooms for decades as the filming location for the sitcom <em>Last of the Summer Wine</em>, a massive 31 series of which were broadcast between 1973 and 2010.  No official final episode of the show was ever made, so we might see a 32nd series yet.
</p><p>
https://dai.ly/x5jg7mv
</p><p>
Fourteen years after <em>Last of the Summer Wine</em> ended, the picture-postcard town of Holmfirth still attracts tourists.  Sid's Café, in the town centre, remains very much in business.  Nora Batty's house is now a holiday let (self-catering).  For those whose interests are more energetic than watching old people doing silly things, the main road from Holmfirth to the summit of Holme Moss is known in the cycling community as one of England's most difficult ascents, lasting 7 kilometres at an average gradient of 5.6%.  The so-called "Col de Moss" was a Category 2 climb in the 2014 Tour de France.
</p><p>
All this is part of the Holme Valley South ward, which includes Holmfirth, a lot of moorland, and a large number of scattered villages with names like Netherthong, Upperthong, Thongsbridge and Hole Bottom.  (Stop laughing at the back.)  Also here is Longley Farm, whose dairy products are exported to Yorkshire and beyond.  Longley Farm was the site of the UK's first commercial wind turbine, which started making electricity for the farm in 1986; the original turbine was dismantled in 2015 and replaced by a more powerful model.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2024/kirklees24.png" alt="Kirklees, 2024" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Despite the rural nature of this area, the local authority here is the Metropolitan Borough of Kirklees which gets its metropolitan nature from the towns of Huddersfield, Dewsbury and Batley.  Kirklees council is often hung; Labour did have a majority here from 2022 to 2024, but in May's council elections they suffered major losses to independent candidates in Dewsbury and Batley - which were followed by that parliamentary seat returning an independent candidate in July.
</p><p>
Dewsbury and Batley are strongly Muslim areas, which gives them a very different electoral dynamic to
Holme Valley South ward which has no Muslim population to speak of.  Holmfirth and its surrounding villages are generally affluent areas with a strong middle-class demographic.  Indeed Holme Valley South ward was safely Conservative not all that long ago.
</p><p>
Holmfirth was once on the Parliamentary map.  Yorkshire was the biggest winner from the 1885 redistribution that more or less created the system of single-member Parliamentary constituencies we have today, and that redistribution created a Holmfirth parliamentary seat covering the Pennine countryside south of Huddersfield and west of Barnsley.  This seat returned Liberal MPs at every election from 1885 to a 1912 by-election.  It was broken up in 1918, with the Holme Valley transferring into the Colne Valley constituency where it has resided ever since.
</p><p>
The Colne Valley constituency has proven to be much more exciting over the decades and its list of previous MPs includes several famous names.  A 1907 by-election was won by the mysterious Victor Grayson as an independent Labour candidate; he lost his seat in January 1910 to the Liberals' Charles Leach, who in 1916 gained the dubious distinction of being the only MP ever to be deprived of his seat for lunacy.  Philip Snowden, the first Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer, represented Colne Valley from 1922 to 1931.  A later Labour MP for the seat, who won a by-election in 1963, was Sir Patrick Duffy who, now aged 104, is Britain's oldest surviving former MP.  If Sir Patrick makes it into the New Year he would become the longest-lived MP whose birth was officially registered: that record is currently held by Ronald Atkins, who died in 2020 at the age of 104 years and 200 days.
</p><p>
Colne Valley had a significant Liberal and later Liberal Democrat vote all the way up to the formation of the Coalition, since when the seat has been a tight Labour-Conservative marginal.  It has changed hands at all of the last three general elections, with Labour candidate Paul Davies defeating the Conservatives' Jason McCartney in July by 4,963 votes.
</p><p>
Davies had started his parliamentary career right here in Holme Valley South ward in 2019, when he gained for Labour what had previously been a safe Conservative ward.  He was re-elected for a second term in 2023, and Labour now hold all three of the ward's council seats following narrow wins over the Conservatives in 2022-24.  The Tories lost their final seat here in May, with Labour winning by 45-41.  Given Labour's generally poor performance in council by-elections since July, the Conservatives will have this one in their sights after Paul Davies resigned from Kirklees council to concentrate on his Westminster duties.
</p><p>
Defending for Labour is Phillip Lucitt, who contested Batley East ward at the other end of the borough in May and lost what had previously been a safe Labour ward to an independent candidate, extremely badly.  The Conservatives have renominated Damian Brook who was their losing candidate here in the last three local elections: Brook is a Holme Valley parish councillor and works as an enforcement officer for the Environment Agency.  Also standing are Toby Cooper for the Green Party, Howard Cohen for the Lib Dems, independent candidate Miri Finch who has stood in other wards at the last three Kirklees elections (in 2022 with the Freedom Alliance nomination) to very little effect, and Susan Laird for Reform UK.  The returning officer for Kirklees would like to reassure voters that the ballot boxes will not be transported to the count by bathtub.

<h2>Grange and Cartmel</h2>
</p><p>
Westmorland and Furness council, Cumbria; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Sue Sanderson.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/westmorland-lonsdale-grange-cartmel-2024-10.png" alt="Westmorland/Furness, Grange/Cartmel" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Continuing the theme of nice-looking countryside in the North, we now come to Lancashire beyond the sands, as it was once was.  Today Grange-over-Sands is a Victorian seaside resort on the south coast of Cumbria, located on the west bank of the Kent estuary at the point where it flows into the flat and dangerous sandbanks, mudflats and saltmarsh of Morecambe Bay.  The Furness railway line, which runs along the promenade, is the main link to the outside world: the railway viaducts on the lines to Lancaster and Ulverston take miles off the road journeys around the Kent and Leven estuaries.  Grange-over-Sands' promenade is interrupted by the forlorn remains of the Grange Lido: this is an Art Deco open-air swimming pool which closed in 1992 and which the council are now finally doing something about.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/geograph-7746049-by-David-Martin.jpg" alt="Grange-over-Sands Promenade" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Grange-over-Sands is the main town on the Cartmel peninsula, which lies between the two estuaries.  Historically the major centre here was Cartmel Priory, founded in 1190 by the great twelfth-century soldier William the Marshal; its church survives as the local parish church.  Appropriately for a ward which is in the top 100 in England and Wales for those employed in accommodation and food service activities, Cartmel is also noted for its food: the village's restaurant L'Enclume is the only restaurant in northern England with three Michelin stars, and Cartmel sticky toffee pudding is a local delicacy.  This pudding is given to all winning connections following races at Cartmel racecourse, whose meetings are normally well-attended; Cartmel's main three-day meeting in May actually takes place over five days, giving visitors time to go off and visit the Lake District countryside in between race days.
</p><p>
Cartmel's isolation was a key ingredient in one of the more audacious betting coups in UK racing history, involving two horses who were purportedly both called Gay Future.  The imposter was presented by his trainer, Anthony Collins, as poorly performing in order to lengthen the odds at the bookmakers, who were then caught off guard when the real Gay Future turned up at Cartmel on the 1974 August bank holiday and won his race by fifteen lengths at a starting price of 10-1.  Those in on the scam had staked doubles and trebles on Gay Future and two other horses trained by Collins, which were never intended to run and never even left their stables; when those horses became non-runners, those wagers suddenly turned into single bets on Gay Future.  The betting firms had twigged that something was going on by the time the horses went under starter's orders, but they were unable to alert the on-course bookies who set the starting prices because Cartmel Racecourse only had one telephone line at the time; Ladbrokes went so far as to send an employee to the course on a motorbike with a bag full of cash, but Bank Holiday traffic meant he arrived too late.  Collins was subsequently prosecuted for conspiracy to defraud, but a sympathetic judge only imposed a fine of £1,000 and a suspended prison sentence while the Jockey Club merely warned him off for ten years.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2022/westmorland-furness22.png" alt="Westmorland/Furness, 2022" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Grange and Cartmel are part of the Westmorland and Lonsdale parliamentary seat, which is the fiefdom of the former Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron who has represented that seat since 2005.  The local authority is Westmorland and Furness council, whose only elections to date were in 2022.  On that occasion the Liberal Democrats won every single seat within Farron's constituency as it was then drawn, which was crucial to them winning overall control of the new council.  Grange and Cartmel ward returned the Lib Dem slate easily with 47% of the vote, against 26% for an independent candidate and 19% for the Conservatives.  Lib Dem councillor Pete Endsor resigned earlier this year due to family ill-health; the resulting by-election was held in May alongside the Cumbria police and crime commissioner elections, and the Liberal Democrats held the seat with a massive 77% of the vote.
</p><p>
This second by-election of the year in Grange and Cartmel ward follows the resignation on health grounds of Sue Sanderson, who was the council's cabinet member for education, inclusion and skills; Sanderson had also held cabinet positions in the post on Cumbria county council and South Lakeland council, which she served as deputy leader of.  Defending for the Lib Dems this time is Tim Bloomer, who is opposed in a straight fight by Tor McLaren for the Conservatives.

<h2>Keswick; and<br>
Wetheral</h2>
</p><p>
Cumberland council, Cumbria; caused respectively by the resignations of Labour councillor Markus Campbell-Savours and Conservative councillor Geoff Mitchell.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/geograph-5597444-by-Walter-Baxter.jpg" alt="Thirlmere" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
We now travel north for our other two Cumbrian by-elections.  Keswick has a strong claim to being one of England's most picturesque wards, as it covers a large chunk of the Lake District National Park.  As well as Keswick town, the ward boundaries include all of Borrowdale and the Thirlmere reservoir, which supplies the far-off city of Manchester with water via a 96-mile aqueduct.  Helvellyn, England's third-highest mountain at 3,116 feet, lies on the ward boundary; also on or within the boundary are three more of the ten highest Wainwrights, Great End (2,984 feet), Great Gable (2,949 feet) and Nethermost Pike (2,923 feet) - together with the only Wainwright under 1,000 feet in altitude, Castle Crag.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/cumberland-keswick.png" alt="Cumberland, Keswick" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
It will not come as much of a surprise that the economy of Keswick ward is dominated by the tourist industry.  In the 2021 census Keswick ward was ranked number 3 in England and Wales for employment in accommodation and food service activities, at 24.95%.  (Number 2 was Ingoldmells on the Lincolnshire coast; number 1 was Windermere and Ambleside on the far side of Dunmail Raise.)  Until 2006 when production moved to Workington, the town's largest non-tourist employer was the Cumberland Pencils factory: the rocks around Keswick contain a large amount of graphite, the raw material for pencils.  The Derwent Pencil Museum is still here.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/cumberland-wetheral.png" alt="Cumberland, Wetheral" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
In much more low-lying and agricultural countryside we find Cumberland's Wetheral ward, which covers the rural area immediately to the south and east of Carlisle city: the ward boundaries take in the villages of Wetheral, Scotby and Cumwhinton, plus Carlisle racecourse and some housing development on the southern edge of Carlisle which has spilled over the old city boundary.  This area is likely to change quite a lot in the next few years: a southern road bypass for Carlisle is currently under construction, and planners have their eyes on much of the surrounding countryside for St Cuthbert's Garden Village, a proposed development of up to 10,000 new homes.  That name is a reference to the parish of St Cuthbert Without, much of which is part of Wetheral ward.
</p><p>
Wetheral ward is a commuter area for Carlisle and it is safely Conservative.  The present ward was drawn up in 2013 as a Cumbria county council division and was reused for the first Cumberland council election in 2022; on that occasion the Conservatives defeated Labour by 53-28 in Wetheral ward while Tory councillors elsewhere in the district were falling like ninepins.  Cumberland council has a Labour majority, with the 2022 elections returning 30 Labour councillors, 7 Conservatives, 4 Lib Dems, 3 independents and two Greens.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2022/cumberland22.png" alt="Cumberland, 2022" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Keswick ward has a much more interesting recent political history.  The town had three members of the old Allerdale council, and regularly returned three councillors from three different political traditions.  The Lib Dems seem to have more or less given up here in the last ten years, and this has been to the benefit of Labour who gained the county council seat in 2017 and won two out of three seats at the last Allerdale council elections in 2019.
</p><p>
Top of the poll in Keswick on that occasion was Labour candidate Markus Campbell-Savours, whose father Dale Campbell-Savours represented Keswick in Parliament from 1979 to 2001 as MP for Workington.  Markus was elected to Cumberland council in 2022 by the wide margin of 68-16 over an independent candidate, and he has now followed in his father's footsteps by entering Parliament in July 2024 as the MP for Penrith and Solway.  This is a new constituency based on the most Conservative areas of the old Workington seat plus much of the old safe-Conservative Penrith and the Border constituency, and Workington's Conservative MP Mark Jenkinson must have thought he had hit the Boundary Commission jackpot when he secured the Conservative nomination for Penrith and Solway: instead, Jenkinson went down to defeat and Markus Campbell-Savours won a majority of 5,257 votes in July.  His new seat also includes the St Cuthbert Without part of Wetheral ward; Wetheral itself is in the Carlisle constituency, which was another Labour gain in July.
</p><p>
Markus Campbell-Savours clearly had a large personal vote, and Labour will be hoping that can transfer to their defending candidate Sally Lansbury in the Keswick by-election.  Lansbury is a guest house owner and Keswick town councillor, and she previously represented the town on Allerdale council from 2019 until its abolition in 2023.  There is no independent candidate this time, so her opposition will come from Graham King for the Conservatives, Jane Hall for the Greens and John Rivers for the Liberal Democrats.
</p><p>
In Wetheral, Conservative councillor Geoff Mitchell has stood down due to changes in his personal circumstances.  The defending Conservative candidate here is Gareth Ellis, who is a former deputy leader of Carlisle city council: he previously represented Belah ward in the north of the city from a 2009 by-election until 2023.  Labour have selected Ruth Alcroft, who was their parliamentary candidate for Carlisle in 2017 and 2019 and is also a former Carlisle city councillor.  Sarah Wills, of the Liberal Democrats, completes the Wetheral ballot paper.

<h2>Falkirk South</h2>
</p><p>
Falkirk council, Scotland; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Euan Stainbank.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/falkirk-falkirk-s-2024.png" alt="Falkirk, Falkirk S">
</p><p>
We finish north of the border in Scotland's most beautiful town, according a 2011 poll for the STV television station.  Falkirk might not have seemed so beautiful back in the day to the Romans: in the second century AD this was the northern frontier of the Roman empire, with the Antonine Wall guarding the high ground overlooking the Forth estuary.
</p><p>
The Romans recorded the site as <em>Varia Capella</em>; this, the Celtic <em>Ecclesbrith</em>, the Gaelic <em>An Eaglais Bhreac</em> and the Scots <em>Fawkirk</em> all refer to a "speckled" church on the site of the present Falkirk Trinity Church.  Falkirk's location next to the Forth and with easy access to local ironstone resulted in it becoming an early centre of the Industrial Revolution, with communication links to match.  The Forth and Clyde Canal opened in 1790, the Union Canal in 1822 and the railways came in the 1830s, giving easy access to Edinburgh and Glasgow.  All of them run through this ward.  The two canals were rejoined in the twenty-first century by the Falkirk Wheel, a unique rotating boat lift which draws large numbers of tourists to the area.  Including your columnist, who took this picture in April 2019.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/falkirk-wheel.webp" alt="Falkirk Wheel, by the author" />
</p><p>
The Falkirk Wheel lies on the boundary of Falkirk South ward, which takes in the town centre and points south of it including a small rural hinterland.  Both of the town's main railway stations (High and Grahamston) are here, as is the mansion of Callendar House which serves as the main museum and heritage centre for Falkirk.
</p><p>
This ward was originally drawn up for the May 2007 elections when Scotland introduced proportional representation to its local elections.  In both 2007 and 2012 Labour won two seats, the SNP and Conservatives one each.  Boundary changes for the 2017 cut the ward down from four councillors to three, and it was Labour who lost from this: the SNP took over first place with 36% of the first preferences, the Conservatives were second with 32% and Labour tell to third on 27%.  All three of those parties won one seat each; in fact, all of the winning candidates (Lorna Binnie for the SNP, John Patrick for the Conservatives and Pat Reid for Labour) got over the 25% required for election on first preferences alone, so there was no need to go to transfers.
</p><p>
The ward's Labour councillor Pat Reid then resigned in 2021, seeking to retire from public life at the age of 79.  This left a difficult seat for Labour to defend from third place at the resulting by-election in October 2021, and in the end they finished in in third place with their seat being gained by the SNP's Emma Russell.  Both SNP coucillors sought re-election in May 2022, but Labour got their seat back from Russell in that ordinary election: vote shares were 42% for the SNP, 29% for the Conservatives and 22% for 22-year-old Labour candidate Euan Stainbank, who picked up transfers from the Conservative surplus and the Greens to win the final seat.  Stainbank, who had finished his law studies at Stirling the previous year, became deputy leader of Falkirk council's Labour group.
</p><p>
Now aged 24, Euan Stainbank has become Scotland's youngest MP after he pulled off an enormous swing of 26% to pick up the Falkirk constituency left open by the retirement of SNP MP John McNally, who enjoyed the largest majority of any Scottish MP in 2019.  Labour had actually finished in third place in Falkirk that year, although this may have been a false position after their parliamentary candidate that year was disendorsed partway through the campaign for antisemitism.
</p><p>
At Holyrood level most of this ward is part of the Falkirk West constituency, whose MSP Michael Matheson has been in the Scottish Parliament continuously since it was reconvened in 1999: he was originally a regional MSP for Central Scotland before being first elected for Falkirk West in 2007.  Matheson was a Scottish Cabinet secretary from 2014 to 2024, latterly holding the NHS recovery, health and social care portfolio.  He resigned that post in February following a scandal over £11,000 of roaming charges which he had run up on a Parliamentary iPad during a family holiday.  The Conservative candidate for Falkirk West in 2021 was Stephen Kerr, who had previously been MP for Stirling from 2017 to 2019; Kerr finished third behind Matheson and Labour, but did get into Holyrood as a regional MSP for Central Scotland.  The rural fringes of Falkirk South ward are in the Falkirk East constituency represented by another former MP: the SNP's Michelle Thomson had a scandal-ridden term for Edinburgh West in 2015-17, but no evidence of wrongdoing was eventually found and she returned to frontline politics as an MSP in 2021.
</p><p>
With Euan Stainbank off to Westminster Labour will need to perform very well to hold this Falkirk South by-election.  In the previous by-election three years ago the Labour candidate was eliminated in third place and the SNP beat the Conservatives in the final count by 51-49; rerunning the 2022 count for one seat gives an increased SNP lead over the Conservatives of 57-43, with Labour again eliminated in third place.
</p><p>
The defending Labour candidate in this by-election does have the advantage of top spot on the alphabetical ballot paper.  Claire Aitken is based in the village of Hallglen just to the south of the town, where she does a lot of community volunteer work.  The SNP have selected Carol Beattie, who was chief executive of neighbouring Stirling council until May.  Standing for the Conservatives is David Grant, who is hoping to return to Falkirk council after losing his seat last year in the neighbouring Bonnybridge and Larbert ward.  Completing the ballot paper are Tom McLaughlin for the Greens, the founder of Falkirk District Action Group Sharron McKean as an independent candidate, Stuart Martin for Reform UK and Sean McCay for the Lib Dems.
