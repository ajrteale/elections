<blockquote>
Every duke and earl and peer is here,<br>
Everyone who should be here is here.<br>
What a smashing, positively dashing<br>
Spectacle: the Ascot opening day.

At the gate are all the horses<br>
Waiting for the cue to fly away.<br>
What a gripping, absolutely ripping<br>
Moment at the Ascot opening day.

- Lerner and Loewe, <em>Ascot Gavotte</em>
</blockquote>

We're in the second week of October, and it's time for Andrew's Previews to go to Berkshire for the first time in 2024.  Mind, we're a bit late for the traditional social occasion of the year: the five-day Royal Ascot race meeting, which is traditionally attended by the Royal Family and features millions of pounds in prize money.  Charles and Camilla aren't quite as obsessive about the gee-gees as the late Elizabeth II was, but the King and Queen do normally have a few horses running at Royal Ascot - last year they even had a winner.  Ascot's most valuable race, the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes, is actually held at a separate meeting in July; while in two days' time racegoers can attend the British Champions Day, the finale to the Flat racing season with a prize fund of £4 million.

Which might be enough to buy you a house in Ascot, if you're lucky.  This is a very expensive and desirable place to live, and Ascot and Sunninghill ward definitely has a commuter demographic with its half-hourly trains to Waterloo.  The presence of a number of boarding schools here means that Ascot and Sunninghill ward is in the top 70 wards in England and Wales for residents aged 16 or 17.  One year-round employer here is Heatherwood Hospital, a minor NHS unit; this is a new building, with the previous Heatherwood Hospital - a filming location for <em>Carry On Matron</em> - currently being redeveloped for new housing.

The local authority here is Windsor and Maidenhead council, which returned a Liberal Democrat majority in 2023; but the party only have a majority of one seat, and they have chosen to form a grand coalition with the main localist independent group to give strong and stable government to the borough.  The Tories, who ran Windsor and Maidenhead council for many years until 2023, are now down to just six councillors plus this vacancy.  Five of the seven Conservatives returned last year represent one of the two wards in the Ascot and Sunningdale area, which is cut off from the rest of the borough by Windsor Great Park and some bizarre local government boundaries; but such was the scale of the Tory rout here last year that even Ascot and Sunninghill ward turned in a marginal result with 40% for the Conservatives, 31% for the Lib Dems and 15% for Labour.  The three Conservative councillors returned here were called Asghar Majeed, Julian Sharpe and John Story.  There are no prizes for guessing which one of those candidates was a long way behind the other two and scraped into the final seat by the skin of their teeth.

Despite that outbreak of casual racism from the electorate, Ascot had a black MP until quite recently - although Adam Afriyie apparently preferred to consider himself as "post-racial".  Afriyie represented the Windsor constituency from 2005 to 2024, when he retired from the Commons following the collapse of his business empire: he had been declared bankrupt in December 2022 on a petition by HMRC, with debts of £1 million to the taxman and £700,000 to Barclays.  In the old days, bankruptcy would have diqualified Afriyie from the Commons immediately, and who knows what might have happened in the resulting by-election; these days insolvents are allowed to stay in elected office unless they behave so badly that they end up with a bankruptcy restrictions order slapped on them.  The Windsor constituency was taken over in July by new Conservative MP Jack Rankin, who worked in the energy markets before entering Parliament; he enjoyed a comfortable majority of 6,457 votes.  Rankin lives in Ascot and Sunninghill ward, and he has signed the nomination papers for the Conservative candidate in this by-election.

This by-election is defended by the Conservatives after long-serving councillor John Story stepped down last month on health grounds.  Story had been first elected to the council in an April 2006 by-election for the predecessor ward of Sunninghill and South Ascot, and he was mayor of the borough during the Platinum Jubilee year of 2022-23.

Defending for the Conservatives is Sally Coneron, who is a business owner - her exporting and manufacturing firm featured on <em>Dragon's Den</em> - and chairman of the governors at St Michael's primary school in Sunninghill.  One former pupil of that school is George Jezard, who is the Lib Dem candidate.  Labour have selected Nigel Hayward, who contested the neighbouring Sunningdale and Cheapside ward last year.  Completing the ballot paper is Matt Newman for the curiously-capitalised "the Borough first", who are the Lib Dems' main coalition partners on the council.

<h2>Tirymynach</h2>

Ceredigion council, West Wales; caused by the death of Liberal Democrat councillor Paul Hinge.

There are two by-elections taking place today in rural Wales.  We'll start on the west coast with the Tirymynach ward of Ceredigion, which covers a number of villages just to the north of Aberystwyth.  The largest settlement in the ward is Bow Street on the main road and railway line towards Machynlleth; Bow Street railway station was reopened in 2021 to serve the village.  Bow Street is unusual in Ceredigion in having an English-language name, which appears to have been lifted directly from the central London thoroughfare of that name.

The ward also takes the smaller settlement of Llangorwen to the west and the coastal village of Clarach, which has been more or less swallowed up by large caravan parks for holidaymakers.  Clarach Bay has a sandy beach, which is crossed by the small Afon Clarach on its way to the ocean.  Further up the coast is the curious feature of Sarn Gynfelyn, a natural causeway which extends 11 kilometres into the sea.  Geographers will tell you that this is the remains of a glacial moraine from the last Ice Age.  Legends, on the other hand, have it that this causeway is a relic of the kingdom of Cantre'r Gwaelod, which now lies beneath the waters of Cardigan Bay.

Ceredigion is one of the four Welsh local government districts which are controlled by Plaid Cymru, all of which are predominantly rural areas with significant numbers of Welsh speakers.  Plaid also represent the Ceredigion Senedd constituency which has same boundaries as the county, although the MS Elin Jones has had a non-partisan role since 2016 as the Senedd's Llywydd, or presiding officer.  Plaid Cymru MP Ben Lake was elected for Ceredigion in 2017 and won a third term of office in July, very easily winning the expanded constituency of Ceredigion Preseli.

Lake had gained his seat in 2017 from the Liberal Democrats, who are now the third-largest group on Ceredigion county council behind the Plaid majority and the independent councillors.  The Lib Dems are defending this by-election following the death of Paul Hinge in August, at the age of 69.  Hinge was chairman of Ceredigion council in 2021-22, and he was the county's Armed Forces Champion having previously served in the Royal Welch Fusiliers; in 2022, Hinge travelled to the Falkland Islands to mark the 40th anniversary of their liberation.  He had represented Tirymynach ward since 2008 and nobody opposed him at his last re-election in 2022; the last time Hinge faced a contest was in 2017, when he defeated the Plaid Cymru candidate by 56-44 in a straight fight.

There is no unopposed return this time with six candidates being nominated for the Tirymynach by-election.  Defending for the Liberal Democrats is Gareth Lewis, who lives within the ward at Clarach.  As does Jonathan Evershed, a "politico" and "recovering academic" according to his social media, who works as a researcher and is the Plaid Cymru candidate.  Also standing are James Cook for Labour, Harry Hayfield for the Greens, Jack Parker for Reform UK and Ethan Terry for the Conservatives.

<h2>Llanberis</h2>

Gwynedd council, North Wales; caused by the resignation of Plaid Cymru councillor Kimberley Jones.

Our other Welsh by-election today takes in place in the heart of Parc Cenedlaethol Eryri, or as English speakers know it, the Snowdonia National Park.  The village of Llanberis lies just under five miles north of Yr Wyddfa, and it is the most common starting point for those who want to climb the mountain - either by foot on the Llanberis Path, or by rail via the Snowdon Mountain Railway.

The Llanberis electoral ward doesn't extend to the summit of Yr Wyddfa, but it does take in most of the Llanberis Path and some summits over 1,000 metres: Snowdon's lower summit of Garnedd Ugain is on the ward boundary, as is the highest point of Glyder Fawr on the north side of the Pass of Llanberis.  This valley runs down to the village of Nant Peris, the ruins of Dolbadarn Castle which was built in the 12th century by Llywelyn the Great, and to the lakes of Llyn Peris and Llyn Padarn either side of Llanberis village.  Llyn Peris, the higher and smaller of the two lakes, is the lower reservoir feeding the massive Dinorwig hydroelectric power plant, and its water level varies a lot depending on the time of day: water flows into Llyn Peris from a higher reservoir at times of peak power demand, and is then pumped back up the mountain when there is excess power in the National Grid.

Llanberis is a strongly Welsh-speaking village.  Indeed the website of Llanberis and Nant Peris community council apologises that "not all the information on this website is available in English at present", which is a refreshing change.  It thus should be no surprise that it is represented at all three levels of government by Plaid Cymru.  In the Senedd, Plaid's former co-deputy leader Siân Gwenllian MS has one of the safest seats in Wales: her Arfon constituency is based on Bangor and Caernarfon.  At Westminster elections, Llanberis was added in 2024 to the Dwyfor Meirionnydd constituency which is represented by Plaid's Westminster group leader Liz Saville Roberts.  Plaid Cymru have a large overall majority on Gwynedd council, and since 2022 Llanberis has been part of that majority: outgoing councillor Kim Jones was elected here that year with 60% of the vote against 32% for an independent candidate.  Before 2022, Llanberis had voted for independent councillors this century.

Defending this by-election for Plaid Cymru is Gwilym Evans, who is a Llanberis and Nant Peris community councillor.  There is one independent candidate standing, Martin Jones, who lives in the village of Cwm y Glo further down the valley: he was a Labour candidate for Cwm y Glo ward in the 2017 Gwynedd elections.  Also standing are Dewi Evans who has the Welsh-only ballot paper description "Plaid Werdd Cymru" (for the uninitiated, that's the Green Party of Wales), and local resident Anne Williams for the Liberal Democrats.

<h2>Holme Valley South</h2>

Kirklees council, West Yorkshire; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Paul Davies.

We now commence a tour of some of the picturesque parts of northern England by climbing up into the spine of the Pennines and specifically to Black Hill, the highest point of West Yorkshire at an elevation of 1,909 feet.  The name is an apt one: the summit of Black Hill consists of peat with no vegetation, and its ascent - an early climb on the Pennine Way - was notorious for its boggy conditions until flagstones were laid.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAAQzA8Fpec

Black Hill lies on the boundary between West Yorkshire and Derbyshire, and its northern and eastern slopes descend into the slopes and villages of the Holme Valley.  This is the countryside which came into our living rooms for decades as the filming location for the sitcom <em>Last of the Summer Wine</em>, a massive 31 series of which were broadcast between 1973 and 2010.  No official final episode of the show was ever made, so we might see a 32nd series yet.

Fourteen years after <em>Last of the Summer Wine</em> ended, the picture-postcard town of Holmfirth still attracts tourists.  Sid's Café, in the town centre, remains very much in business.  Nora Batty's house is now a holiday let (self-catering).  The main road from Holmfirth to the summit of Holme Moss is known in the cycling community as one of England's most difficult ascents - 7 kilometres at an average gradient of 5.6% - and it was a Category 2 climb in the 2014 Tour de France.  All this is part of the Holme Valley South ward, which includes Holmfirth, a lot of moorland, and a large number of scattered villages with names like Netherthong, Upperthong, Thongsbridge and Hole Bottom.  (Stop laughing at the back.)  Also here is Longley Farm, whose dairy products are exported to Yorkshire and beyond.  Longley Farm was the site of the UK's first commercial wind turbine, which started making electricity for the farm in 1986; the original turbine was dismantled in 2015 and replaced by a more powerful model.

Despite the rural nature of this area the local authority here is the Metropolitan Borough of Kirklees, which gets its metropolitan nature from the towns of Huddersfield, Dewsbury and Batley.  Kirklees council is often hung; Labour did have a majority here from 2022 to 2024, but in May's council elections they suffered major losses to independent candidates in Dewsbury and Batley - which were followed by that parliamentary seat returning an independent candidate in July.

Dewsbury and Batley are strongly Muslim areas, which gives them a very different electoral dynamic to
Holme Valley South ward which has no Muslim population to speak of: Holmfirth and its surrounding villages are generally affluent areas with a strong middle-class demographic.  Indeed Holme Valley South ward was safely Conservative not all that long ago.

Holmfirth was once on the Parliamentary map.  Yorkshire was the biggest winner from the 1885 redistribution that more or less created the system of single-member Parliamentary constituencies, and that redistribution created a Holmfirth parliamentary seat covering the Pennine countryside south of Huddersfield and west of Barnsley.  This seat returned Liberal MPs at every election from 1885 to a 1912 by-election.  It was broken up in 1918, with the Holme Valley transferring into the Colne Valley constituency where it has resided ever since.

The Colne Valley constituency has prven to be much more exciting over the decades and its list of previous MPs includes several famous names.  A 1907 by-election was won by the mysterious Victor Grayson as an independent Labour candidate; he lost his seat in January 1910 to the Liberals' Charles Leach, who in 1916 gained the dubious distinction of being the only MP ever to be deprived of his seat for lunacy.  Philip Snowden, the first Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer, represented Colne Valley from 1922 to 1931.  A later Labour MP for the seat, who won a by-election in 1963, was Sir Patrick Duffy who, now aged 104, is Britain's oldest surviving former MP.  If Sir Patrick makes it into the New Year he would become the longest-lived MP since births were registered: that record is currently held by Ronald Atkins, who died in 2020 at the age of 104 years and 200 days.

Colne Valley had a significant Liberal and later Liberal Democrat vote all the way up to the formation of the Coalition, since when the seat has been a tight Labour-Conservative marginal.  It has changed hands at all of the last three general elections, with Labour candidate Paul Davies defeating the Conservatives' Jason McCartney in July by 4,963 votes.

Davies had started his parliamentary career right here in Holme Valley South ward in 2019, when he gained for Labour what had previously been a safe Conservative ward.  He was re-elected for a second term in 2023, and Labour now hold all three of the ward's council seats following narrow wins over the Conservatives in 2022-24.  The Tories lost their final seat here in May, with Labour winning by 45-41.  Given Labour's generally poor performance in council by-elections since July, the Conservatives will have this one in their sights after Paul Davies resigned from Kirklees council to concentrate on his Westminter duties.

Defending for Labour is Phillip Lucitt, who contested Batley East ward at the other end of the borough in May and lost what had previously been a safe Labour ward to an independent candidate, extremely badly.  The Conservatives have renominated Damian Brook who was their losing candidate here in the last three local elections: Brook is a Holme Valley parish councillor and works as an enforcement officer for the Environment Agency.  Also standing are Toby Cooper for the Green Party, Howard Cohen for the Lib Dems, independent candidate Miri Finch who has stood in other wards at the last three Kirklees elections (in 2022 with the Freedom Alliance nomination) to very little effect, and Susan Laird for Reform UK.

<h2>Grange and Cartmel</h2>

Westmorland and Furness council, Cumbria; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Sue Sanderson.

Continuing the theme of nice-looking countryside in the North, we now come to the Lonsdale part of the Westmorland and Lonsdale district - Lancashire beyond the sands, as it was once was.  Today Grange-over-Sands is a Victorian seaside resort on the south coast of Cumbria, located on the west bank of the Kent estuary at the point where it flows into the flat and dangerous sandbanks, mudflats and saltmarsh of Morecambe Bay.  The Furness railway line, which runs along the promenade, is the main link to the outside world: the railway viaducts on the lines to Lancaster and Ulverston take miles off the roads around the Kent and Leven estuaries.  Grange-over-Sands' promenade is interrupted by the forlorn remains of the Grange Lido: this is an Art Deco open-air swimming pool which closed in 1992 and which the council are now finally doing something about.

Grange-over-Sands is the main town on the Cartmel peninsula, which lies between the two estuaries.  Historically the major centre here was Cartmel Priory, founded in 1190 by the great twelfth-century soldier William the Marshal; its church survives as the local parish church.  Appropriately for a ward which is in the top 100 in England and Wales for those employed in accommodation and food service activities, Cartmel is also noted for its food: the village's restaurant L'Enclume is the only restaurant in northern England with three Michelin stars, and Cartmel sticky toffee pudding is a local delicacy.  This pudding is given to all winning connections following races at Cartmel racecourse, whose meetings are normally well-attended; Cartmel's main three-day meeting in May actually takes place over five days, giving visitors time to go off and visit the Lake District countryside in between race days.

Cartmel's isolation was a key ingredient in one of the more audacious betting coups in recent years, involving two horses who were purpotedly both called Gay Future.  The imposter was presented by his trainer, Anthony Collins, as poorly performing in order to lengthen the odds at the bookmakers, who were then caught off guard when the real Gay Future turned up at Cartmel on the 1974 August bank holiday and won his race by fifteen lengths at a starting price of 10-1.  Those in on the scam had staked doubles and trebles on Gay Future and two other horses trained by Collins, which were never intended to run and never even left their stables; when those horses became non-runners, those wagers suddenly turned into single bets on Gay Future.  The betting firms had twigged that something was going on by the time the horses went under starter's orders, but they were unable to alert the on-course bookies who set the starting prices because Cartmel Racecourse only had one telephone line at the time; Ladbrokes went so far as to send an employee to the course on a motorbike with a bag full of cash, but Bank Holiday traffic meant he arrived too late.  Collins was subsequently prosecuted for conspiracy to defraud, but a sympathetic judge only imposed a fine of £1,000 and a suspended prison sentence while the Jockey Club merely warned him off for ten years.

Grange and Cartmel are part of the Westmorland and Lonsdale parliamentary seat, which is the fiefdom of the former Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron who has represented that seat since 2005.  The local authority is Westmorland and Furness council, whose only elections to date were in 2022.  On that occasion the Liberal Democrats won every single seat within Farron's constituency as it was then drawn, which was crucial to them winning overall control of the new council.  Grange and Cartmel ward returned the Lib Dem slate easily with 47% of the vote, against 26% for an independent candidate and 19% for the Conservatives.  Lib Dem councillor Pete Endsor resigned earlier this year due to family ill-health; the resulting by-election was held in May alongside the Cumbria police and crime commissioner elections, and the Liberal Democrats held the seat with a massive 77% of the vote.

This second by-election of the year in Grange and Cartmel ward follows the resignation on health grounds of Sue Sanderson, who was the council's cabinet member for education, inclusion and skills; Sanderson had also hed cabinet positions in the post on Cumbria county council and South Lakeland council, which she served as deputy leader of.  Defending for the Lib Dems this time is Tim Bloomer, who is opposed in a straight fight by Tor McLaren for the Conservatives.

<h2>Keswick; and<br>
Wetheral</h2>

Cumberland council, Cumbria; caused respectively by the resignations of Labour councillor Markus Campbell-Savours and Conservative councillor Geoff Mitchell.

We now travel north for our other two Cumbrian by-elections.  Keswick has a strong claim to being one of England's most picturesque wards, as it covers a large chunk of the Lake District National Park.  As well as Keswick town, the ward boundaries include all of Borrowdale and the Thirlmere reservoir, which supplies the far-off city of Manchester with water via a 96-mile aqeduct.  Helvellyn, England's third-highest mountain at 3,116 feet, lies on the ward boundary; also on or within the boundary are three more of the ten highest Wainwrights, Great End (2,984 feet), Great Gable (2,949 feet) and Nethermost Pike (2,923 feet) - together with the only Wainwright under 1,000 feet in altitude, Castle Crag.

It will not come as much of a surprise that the economy of Keswick ward is domianted by the tourist industry.  In the 2021 census Keswick ward was ranked number 3 in England and Wales for employemnt in accommodation and food service activities, at 24.95%.  (Number 2 was Ingoldmells on the Lincolnshire coast; number 1 was Windermere and Ambleside on the far side of Dunmail Raise.)  Until 2006 when production moved to Workington, the town's largest non-tourist employer was the Cumberland Pencils factory: the rocks around Keswick contain a large amount of graphite, the raw material for pencils.  The Derwent Pencil Museum is still here.

In much more low-lying and agricultural countryside we find Cumberland's Wetheral ward, which covers the rural area immediately to the south and east of Carlisle city: the ward boundaries take in the villages of Wetheral, Scotby and Cumwhinton, plus Carlisle racecourse and some housing development on the southern edge of Carlisle which has spilled over the old city boundary.  This area is likely to change quite a lot in the next few years: a southern road bypass for Carlisle is currently under construction, and planners have their eyes on much of the surrounding countryside for St Cuthbert's Garden Village, a proposed development of up to 10,000 new homes.  That name is a reference to the parish of St Cuthbert Without, much of which is part of Wetheral ward.

Wetheral ward is a commuter area for Carlisle and is safely Conservative.  The present ward was drawn up in 2013 as a Cumbria county council division and was reused for the first Cumberland council election in 2022; on that occasion the Conservatives defeated Labour by 53-28 in Wetheral ward while Tory councillors elsewhere in the district were falling like ninepins.  Cumberland council has a Labour majority, with the 2022 elections returning 30 Labour councillors, 7 Conservatives, 4 Lib Dems, 3 independents and two Greens.

Keswick ward has a much more interesting recent political history.  The town had three members of the old Allerdale council, and regularly returned three councillors from three different political traditions.  The Lib Dems seem to have more or less given up here in the last ten years, and this has been to the benefit of Labour who gained the county council seat in 2017 and won two out of three seats at the last Allerdale council elections in 2019.

Top of the poll in Keswick on that occasion was Labour candidate Markus Campbell-Savours, whose father Dale Campbell-Savours represented Keswick in Parliament from 1979 to 2001 as MP for Workington.  Markus was elected to Cumberland council in 2022 by the wide margin of 68-16 over an independent candidate, and he has now followed in his father's footsteps by entering Parliament in July 2024 as the MP for Penrith and Solway.  This is a new constituency based on the most Conservative areas of the old Workington seat plus much of the old safe-Conservative Penrith and the Border constituency, and Workington's Conservative MP Mark Jenkinson must have thought he had hit the Boundary Commission jackpot when he secured the Cosnervative nomination for Penrith and Solway: instead, Jenkinson went down to defeat and Markus Campbell-Savours won a majority of 5,257 votes in July.  His new seat also includes the St Cuthbert Without part of Wetheral ward; Wetheral itself is in the Carlisle constituency, which was another Labour gain in July.

Markus Campbell-Savours clearly had a large personal vote, and Labour will be hoping that can transfer to their defending candidate Sally Lansbury in the Keswick by-election.  Lansbury is a guest house owner and Keswick town councillor, and she previously represented the town on Allerdale council from 2019 until its abolition in 2023.  There is no independent candidate this time, so her opposition will come from Graham King for the Conservatives, Jane Hall for the Greens and John Rivers for the Liberal Democrats.

In Wetheral, Conservative councillor Geoff Mitchell has stood down due to changes in his personal circumstances.  The defending Conservative candidate here is Gareth Ellis, who is a former deputy leader of Carlisle city council: he previously represented Belah ward in the north of the city from a 2009 by-election until 2023.  Labour have selected Ruth Alcroft, who was their parliamentary candidate for Carlisle in 2017 and 2019 and is also a former Carlisle city councillor.  Sarah Wills, of the Liberal Democrats, completes the Wetheral ballot paper.

<h2>Falkirk South</h2>

Falkirk council, Scotland; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Euan Stainbank.
</p><p>

</p><p>
We finish north of the border in Scotland's most beautiful town, according a 2011 poll for the STV television station.  Falkirk might not have seemed so beautiful back in the day to the Romans: in the second century AD this was the northern frontier of the Roman empire, with the Antonine Wall guarding the high ground overlooking the Forth estuary.
</p><p>
The Romans recorded the site as <em>Varia Capella</em>; this, the Celtic <em>Ecclesbrith</em>, the Gaelic <em>An Eaglais Bhreac</em> and the Scots <em>Fawkirk</em> all refer to a "speckled" church on the site of the present Falkirk Trinity Church.  Falkirk's location next to the Forth and with easy access to local ironstone resulted in it becoming an early centre of the Industrial Revolution, with communication links to match.  The Forth and Clyde Canal opened in 1790, the Union Canal in 1822 and the railways came in the 1830s, giving easy access to Edinburgh and Glasgow.  All of them run through this ward.  The two canals were rejoined in the twenty-first century by the Falkirk Wheel, a unique rotating boat lift which draws large numbers of tourists to the area.  Including your columnist, who took this picture in April 2019.
</p><p>

</p><p>
The Falkirk Wheel lies on the boundary of Falkirk South ward, which takes in the town centre and points south of it including a small rural hinterland.  Both of the town's main railway stations (High and Grahamston) are here, as is the mansion of Callendar House which serves as the main museum and heritage centre for Falkirk.
</p><p>
This ward was originally drawn up for the May 2007 elections when Scotland introduced proportional representation to its local elections.  In both 2007 and 2012 Labour won two seats, the SNP and Conservatives one each.  Boundary changes for the 2017 cut the ward down from four councillors to three, and it was Labour who lost from this: the SNP took over first place with 36% of the first preferences, the Conservatives were second with 32% and Labour tell to third on 27%.  All three of those parties won one seat each; in fact, all of the winning candidates (Lorna Binnie for the SNP, John Patrick for the Conservatives and Pat Reid for Labour) got over the 25% required for election on first preferences alone, so there was no need to go to transfers.

The ward's Labour councillor Pat Reid then resigned in 2021, seeking to retire from public life at the age of 79.  This left a difficult seat for Labour to defend from third place at the resulting by-election in October 2021, and in the end they finished in the resulting by-election which went to the SNP's Emma Russell.  Both SNP coucillors sought re-election in May 2022, but Labour got their seat back in the ordinary election from Russell: vote shares were 42% for the SNP, 29% for the Conservatives and 22% for 22-year-old Labour candidate Euan Stainbank, who picked up transfers from the Conservative surplus and the Greens to win the final seat.  Stainbank, who had finished his law studies at Stirling the previous year, became deputy leader of Falkirk council's Labour group.

Now aged 24, Euan Stainbank has become Scotland's youngest MP after he pulled off an enormous swing of 26% to pick up the Falkirk constituency left open by the retirement of SNP MP John McNally, who enjoyed the largest majority of any Scottish MP in 2019.  Labour had actually finished in third place in Falkirk that year, although this may have been a false position after their parliamentary candidate that year was disendorsed partway through the campaign for antisemitism.

At Holyrood level most of this ward is part of the Falkirk West constituency, whose MSP Michael Matheson has been in the Scottish Parliament cotinuously since it was reconvened in 1999: he was originally a regional MSP for Central Scotland before being first elected for Falkirk West in 2007.  Matheson was a Scottish Cabinet secretary from 2014 to 2024, latterly holding the NHS recovery, health and social care portfolio.  He resigned that post in February following a scandal over £11,000 of roaming charges which he had run up on a Parliamentary iPad during a family holiday.  The Conservative candidate for Falkirk West in 2021 was Stephen Kerr, who had previously been MP for Stirling from 2017 to 2019; Kerr finished third behind Matheson and Labour, but did get into Holyrood as a regional MSP for Central Scotland.  The rural fringes of Falkirk South ward are in the Falkirk East constituency represented by another former MP: the SNP's Michelle Thomson had a scandal-ridden term for Edinburgh West in 2015-17, but no evidence of wrongdoing was eventually found and she returned to frontline politics as an MSP in 2021.

With Euan Stainbank off to Westminster Labour will need to perform very well to hold this Falkirk South by-election.  In the previous by-election three years ago the Labour candidate was eliminated in third place and the SNP beat the Conservatives in the final count by 51-49; rerunning the 2022 count for one seat gives an increased SNP lead over the Conservatives of 57-43, with Labour again eliminated in third place.

The defending Labour candidate in this by-election does have the advantage of top spot on the alphabetical ballot paper.  Claire Aitken is based in the village of Hallglen just to the south of the town, where she does a lot of community volunteer work.  The SNP have seleceted Carol Beattie, who was chief executive of neighbouring Stirling council until May.  Standing for the Conservatives is David Grant, who is hoping to return to Falkirk council after losing his seat last year in the neighbouring Bonnybridge and Larbert ward.  Completing the ballot paper are Tom McLaughlin for the Greens, the founder of Falkirk District Action Group Sharron McKean as an independent candidate, Stuart Martin for Reform UK and Sean McCay for the Lib Dems.
