<!-- Andrew's previews continue to be historical and electoral tours de force. - Lord Hayward -->
<blockquote>
"All the right votes, but not necessarily in the right order"
</blockquote>
</p><p>
Before we start this week, there are a couple of apologies arising from previous Previews.  Firstly, there was a howler in last week's Rhyl Trellewelyn preview: the Conservative MS for Vale of Clwyd is Gareth Davies, not James Davies who was the Conservative MP for the seat until it disappeared in July's boundary changes.  I get the impression from James' email which kindly pointed this out that I might not have been the first person to make this mistake, but it's embarrassing nonetheless.  Apologies to James and Gareth.
</p><p>
The other apology relates to the 2nd September 2021 edition of the Previews, in which I covered a by-election to Calderdale council following the resignation of independent councillor Rob Holden.  He had originally been elected in 2014 as a Conservative, quit the party in 2016 after blowing the whistle on accounting irregularities, lost re-election as an independent in 2018, and then got his seat back as an independent in 2019 in Ryburn ward.  In 2021 Holden resigned from the council following a suicide attempt, and in my preview of the Ryburn ward by-election (at which the seat reverted to the Conservatives) I wrote "This column wishes Holden well for the future."
</p><p>
Those are words which I wrote with no knowledge of what was to come and which I now regret, because it turns out that the correct place for Holden was the Councillors Behaving Badly File.  Last week Rob Holden was sent to prison for six years and two months after pleading guilty to a string of voyeurism offences, a number of counts of computer misuse, and absconding to Cape Verde from where he had to be extradited.  Some of those offences were committed while he was a councillor.  Holden will also be on the sex offenders' register for the rest of his life, which (at least in England) disqualifies him from being a councillor.  This column hopes not to have to write about him again in future.
</p><p>
We have an extraordinarily busy October ahead of us, with sixty council seats up for election over the next five weeks.  Just four of these go to the polls on 3rd October 2024, with Labour defending three seats and the Scottish National Party one.  Two of those polls are in Dundee while the other two are in Lancashire, where we start:
</p><p>
<h2>Marton</h2>
</p><p>
Blackpool council, Lancashire; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Sarah Smith.
</p><p>
<blockquote>
There's a famous seaside place called Blackpool,<br>
That's noted for fresh air and fun,<br>
And Mr and Mrs Ramsbottom<br>
Went there with young Albert, their son.
</blockquote>
</p><p>
Blackpool traditionally remains busy well into the autumn thanks to that festival of electric light known as the Illuminations.  But we're getting into the time of year where the beach is a bit cold - the Costa del Sol this is not.  So, what are Mr and Mrs Ramsbottom and young Albert to do?
</p><p>
<blockquote>
So, seeking for further amusement,<br>
They paid and went into the zoo<br>
Where they'd lions and tigers and camels<br>
And old ale and sandwiches too.
</blockquote>
</p><p>
Back in April, your columnist was in Blackpool twice in the same weekend.  On one day I did the research trip for May's parliamentary by-election in Blackpool North.  More on that story later.  The previous evening my military band were playing for a private function at the Village Hotel, which is located on the eastern edge of the town just outside the boundary of Blackpool Zoo.  Members of the band who went outside for a smoke break could hear lions roaring the darkness.  Lions, as young Albert Ramsbottom is about to find out, are dangerous.
</p><p>
<blockquote>
There were one great big lion called Wallace;<br>
His nose was all covered with scars.<br>
He lay in a som-no-lent posture<br>
With the side of his face on the bars.
</p><p>
Now Albert had heard about lions,<br>
How they was ferocious and wild.<br>
To see Wallace lying so peaceful,<br>
Well... it didn’t seem right to the child.
</p><p>
So straight 'way the brave little feller,<br>
Not showing a morsel of fear,<br>
Took 'is stick with the 'orse’s 'ead 'andle<br>
And shoved it in Wallace’s ear!
</p><p>
You could see that the lion didn't like it,<br>
For giving a kind of a roll,<br>
He pulled Albert inside the cage with 'im<br>
And swallowed the little lad... whole!
</blockquote>
</p><p>

" alt="Wallace the Lion (credit: Blackpool Zoo)" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Wallace the lion died at Blackpool Zoo in 2022 at the age of 15 - from old age, rather than from the effects of eating children.  Visitors to Blackpool Zoo are reassured that the place is run to modern safety standards and that they are in no danger of being eaten by lions.  Well, as long as they don't provoke them like young Albert did.
</p><p>
If Blackpool Zoo doesn't occupy the whole of your day, then directly outside it is the interwar splendour of Stanley Park which was opened in 1928 by and named after the Earl of Derby.  Or, if wildlife is your thing, the lake of Marton Mere - now much reduced in size due to land drainage - supports all sorts of natural habitats.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/blackpool-marton.png" alt="Blackpool, Marton" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Marton ward's housing lies to the south of all this open space along the Preston New Road, traditionally the main road into Blackpool from the east.  In an office complex not far off the road we find one of the town's largest employers, the National Savings and Investments offices.  This is the location of ERNIE, the Electronic Random Number Indicator Equipment which conducts the monthly Premium Bond draws.  The original ERNIE can be seen in the Science Museum in London where it takes up a large chunk of a large room; the fifth and present ERNIE is a computer chip half a centimetre long.  Such is progress.
</p><p>
This area is part of the parliamentary seat of Blackpool South, which was the scene of the last parliamentary by-election of the 2019-24 Parliament after Conservative MP Scott Benton was forced out of the Commons over a lobbying sting.  The by-election happened alongside the May 2024 local elections and was gained by Labour candidate Chris Webb on a massive swing.  Webb was easily re-elected for a full term of office in an expanded Blackpool South constituency two months later, with the Conservatives falling further to a poor third behind Reform UK.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2023/blackpool23.png" alt="Blackpool, 2023" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
In Blackpool council elections Marton ward is closely fought between the Conservatives and Labour.  In this century the ward voted Conservative in 2003 and 2007, then split its two seats between the Conservatives and Labour in 2011 before Labour gained the other Conservative seat at a 2012 by-election.  In 2019 Labour lost Marton ward's two seats to the Conservatives and an independent candidate (who won with a majority of one vote), before getting them back in 2023 when vote shares were 51% for Labour and 40% for the Conservatives.
</p><p>
We are seeing a lot of by-elections at the moment to replace Labour councillors who have been elected as MPs, and this one of them.  The outgoing councillor for Marton ward is Sarah Smith, who was first elected here in 2023.  In July she was elected as the MP for Hyndburn in Lancashire, defeating first-term Conservative Sara Britcliffe.
</p><p>
Defending this seat for Labour is Sam Benson, who works in the care sector.  She may be helped in this defence by a split on the right: the official Conservative candidate is Neil Harvey, who contested Victoria ward last year, while former Conservative ward councillor Andrew Stansfield is now standing as independent candidate.  Also on the ballot are Jim O'Neill for Reform UK, Bill Greene for the Liberal Democrats and Ben Thomas for the Green Party.

<h2>Scotforth East</h2>
</p><p>
Lancaster council; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Sophie Maddocks.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/lancaster-scotforth-e.png" alt="Lancaster, Scotforth E" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Our other Lancashire by-election is in the city of Lancaster itself.  Scotforth is a southern suburb of Lancaster, lying along the A6 road towards the Lancsater University campus and Preston beyond.  This isn't a student area as such, but the University does have an effect on Scotforth East's census return nonetheless: in the 2021 census, taken when the ward had slightly different boundaries, this ward made the top 60 in England and Wales for residents who work in the education sector.
</p><p>
The city of Lancsater has unusually fragmented local politics, which Andrew's Previews has had the opportunity to examine on many previous occasions because the council tends to generate a lot of by-elections.  This is already the fourth casual vacancy of the current city council term, which started in May 2023.  Scotforth East ward shares some of the volatility of the council as a whole: it voted Lib Dem until 2007, split its two seats between Labour and the Conservatives in 2011, and has voted Labour since.  In 2023 the Green Party had a go here, and they came up just short: vote shares here last year were 41% for Labour, 35% for the Greens and 19% for the Conservatives, with the Greens finishing just three votes behind the second Labour candidate.
</p><p>
The close Labour-Green fight in Scotforth East reflected the council as a whole, with the 2023 elections returning 24 Labour councillors, 21 Greens, 7 Lib Dems, 5 Conservatives, 3 Morecambe Bay Independents and one other independent.  A traffic-light coalition is running the show.  The Greens took a by-election off Labour in July in the neighbouring University ward (on one of the most appalling turnouts this column has ever seen), and a Labour to independent defection since then means that Labour will fall into second place on the council if they lose this by-election.
</p><p>
Labour also represent this area at other levels of government.  The Labour MP for Lancaster and Wyre is Cat Smith, who comfortably won her fourth term of office in May but needed to gain her seat from the Conservatives all over again to do so: this year's parliamentary boundary changes, which took Fleetwood out of Smith's constituency, also notionally removed her majority.  Labour also hold the Lancaster South East seat on the county council.
</p><p>
The resignation for personal reasons of Sophie Maddocks, who was first elected in 2023, gives Labour a difficult by-election defence here.  Their defending candidate is Mark Jarnell, who works in the health sector; he is a parish councillor in Ellel parish to the south (covering Galgate), and he previously served on Chorley council from 2014 to 2018.  The Green candidate Andrew Otway appears to be fighting his first election campaign.  Timothy Wood is the Conservative candidate, and the Lib Dems' Malcolm Martin completes the ballot paper.

<h2>Lochee; and<br>
Strathmartine</h2>
</p><p>
Dundee council, Scotland; caused respectively by the death of Labour councillor Charlie Malone and the resignation of Scottish National Party councillor John Alexander.
</p><p>
Earlier this year Andrew's Previews paid tribute upon his death to Lancaster University professor David Denver, who over a long career did much to improve our understanding of local elections in his native Scotland.  This included one innovative experiment from the 1970s involving two Dundee tower blocks which were located at the same distance from their polling station.  Denver and his co-researcher John Bochel agreed with Dundee Labour - who were the only party active at the time in what was a safe ward for them - that the party would campaign in only one of the blocks and leave the other block alone apart from a single leaflet.  When the results of the study came in, the experimental tower block had a 10% higher turnout and a 4% higher Labour vote than the control tower block.  Local campaigning works.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2022/dundee22.png" alt="Dundee, 2022" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Times have changed since the 1970s, of course, and Labour have no safe wards left in Dundee - in fact, they haven't carried a single one of the city's eight wards since the 2007 local elections.  Dundee is now a stronghold of the Scottish National Party, which won an overall majority on the city council in 2012 and 2022.  That's a serious achievement in Scotland, where local elections use proportional representation.  The 2022 Dundee elections returned 15 SNP councillors against 9 Labour, 4 Lib Dems and 1 Conservative.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/dundee-lochee.png" alt="Dundee, Lochee" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Today a quarter of the city goes to the polls in the Lochee and Strathmartine wards, which cover housing in the north and north-west of the city.  Lochee ward is Dundee's inner north-west: Lochee itself is an old village which thrived on the textile industry, and the Camperdown Works here was once the world's largest jute factory.  Back in the 19th century Camperdown Works attracted a large number of Irish people looking for jobs, and Lochee is still sometimes known as "Little Tipperary".
</p><p>
The name of Camperdown recalls a naval battle of that name which took place off the Dutch village of Kamperduin in 1797: the Batavian navy were defeated by the British North Sea fleet under the command of Admiral Adam Duncan.  (He was the Admiral Duncan who gave his name to the Soho pub which was bombed in 1999.)  Victory in the Battle of Camperdown was a welcome boost for the Royal Navy following the mutinies at Spithead and the Nore earlier in that year, and Admiral Duncan was immediately rewarded with the hereditary title of Viscount Duncan, an annual pension of £3,000, and land in his native Dundee.  His son, the first Earl of Camperdown, built a large Greek Revival house here for the family.  The Camperdown estate is now in the hands of Dundee city council, which has turned it into a public park and a small zoo.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/dundee-strathmartine.png" alt="Dundee, Strathmartine" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Camperdown Country Park is now the western end of the Strathmartine ward, whose name calls back to the local legend of the Dundee Dragon.  Back in the day, this particular dragon killed the nine daughters of a local farmer before being itself slain in a revenge attack by Martin, the lover of one of those daughters.  Martin's Stone, an inscribed stone in a field a couple of miles to the north of here, is said to be the place where the dragon was killed.  To this day dragons appear in Dundee's coat of arms as well as in a number of outdoor works of art in the city centre, while here in the ward we have the secondary school of Baldragon Academy.  This serves the estates of Kirkton, Downfield, St Mary's and Ardler which make up the ward; much of the housing here was originally developed by the council.
</p><p>
Some of Baldragon Academy's pupils will go on to further education at the Dundee and Angus College, whose former students include one David Jones who studied computer programming here while working as an apprentice at the Timex electronics factory.  When Timex laid Jones off in 1986, he ploughed his redundancy money into setting up a computer games firm called DMA Design, which gave us the wildly successful <em>Lemmings</em> and <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> computer games franchises of the 1990s.  In a nod to DMA Design's Dundee roots, the original <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> had a district of Liberty City called Ardler.

</p><p>
As stated, Dundee's politics these days are dominated by the Scottish National Party.  Both Lochee and Strathmartine wards are part of the Dundee City West seat at Holyrood, which has been represented since 2007 by SNP MSP Joe FitzPatrick.  He retired to the backbenches at the end of the Yousaf administration earlier this year after a long time on the SNP frontbench: as part of his Scottish Government career FitzPatrick had introduced the 2015 bill which which reduced the voting age in Scottish local elections to 16.  In the 2021 Holyrood elections FitzPatrick won a fifth term of office very comfortably over Labour candidate Mercedes Villalba and Conservative Tess White, who both got into Holyrood nonetheless as North East Scotland regional MSPs.
</p><p>
The SNP's rout in July across the Central Belt has left north-eastern Scotland as their main stronghold, but local MP Chris Law was run very close in the Dundee Central constituency this year: he defeated Labour candidate Richard McCready by just 675 votes to win his fourth term of office.  Finishing last out of the ten candidates here in July was YouTube prankster Niko Omilana, or more accurately one of his doppelgängers: standing in more than one constituency at a Westminster election is not allowed, and Omilana got around this by persuading a number of people to stand in his name through creative abuse of the "commonly known as" box on the nomination form.  In the case of Dundee Central, "Niko Omilana" was a pseudonym for one Olivia Dewar.
</p><p>
Turning to the city council elections, Lochee ward has had very stable election results since it was drawn up for the 2007 election: the SNP have carried every poll, and the ward's four seats have split equally between the SNP and Labour at every election.  Two of its former councillors have gone on to Holyrood, Nigel Don for the SNP (who was elected to both the council and the Parliament in 2007, resulting in a by-election which the SNP won) and Michael Marra for Labour (the nephew of the Dundee folk musician of the same name).  First preferences here in 2022 were 43% for the SNP and 36% for Labour; on a two-party preferred basis the SNP led Labour 53-47.  This is exactly the lead which Labour overturned to hold the Inverness Central by-election last week, and they will need to pull the same swing off again to hold this by-election.
</p><p>
Strathmartine ward was for many years the stomping ground of independent councillor Ian Borthwick, who was first elected as a Labour member of Dundee town council all the way back in 1963 and was in the Labour party until the 1980s.  Borthwick stood in the 2003 Holyrood elections as an independent candidate for Dundee West, finishing in third place with a creditable 19%.  The 2007 to 2017 elections to Strathmartine ward all returned two SNP councillors, one Labour councillor and Borthwick as an independent; following the 2017 elections Borthwick became the city's Lord Provost, at the age of 78.  He finally retired in 2022 after almost sixty years as a Dundee councillor, and his seat was picked up by the Liberal Democrats.  Vote shares here in 2022 were 45% for the SNP, 23% for Labour and 19% for the Lib Dems; re-running the count for one seat gives 59% to the SNP and 41% to Labour at the end.
</p><p>
The SNP will need to hold the Strathmartine by-election to keep their council majority, following the resignation of John Alexander who had been leader of the council since 2017.  (Mark Flynn, father of the SNP's Westminster leader Stephen Flynn, has taken over that role.)  Alexander had been first elected for Strathmartine ward in 2012 when he was just 23 years old, and he was well-thought of enough to be twice named as "Leader of the Year" at the Local Government Information Unit's annual Councillor awards.  He is taking up a new job with the energy firm SSEN.
</p><p>
The Lochee by-election is a Labour defence following the death in July of Charlie Malone, just before his 64th birthday.  Malone had previously worked at the Timex plant, and he had a prominent role in the 1993 industrial dispute which led to the company closing their Dundee factory and to the resignation of the company's president.  In more recent years Charlie Malone had lectured at Abertay University.  He had served Lochee ward since 2017.
</p><p>
The defending Labour candidate in Lochee is Marty Smith, who works for the Scottish branch of the Samaritans and campaigns on food poverty.  The SNP have selected Lee Mills, who appears to be a first-time candidate.  Also standing are Calum Walker for the Conservatives, Kate Treharne for the Greens, Outi Bourke for the Lib Dems, Alan Ross for Alba, and - appropriately enough given that this is the area where George Galloway grew up - John Reddy for the Workers Party of Britain.
</p><p>
In Strathmartine ward the defending SNP candidate is Jimmy Black, who is a journalist and podcaster specialising in housing issues.  The Labour candidate is Richard McCready, a former long-serving Dundee councillor for West End ward who lost his seat in 2022: he was a close runner-up in the Westminster election for Dundee Central three months ago.  Standing for the Lib Dems is Jenny Blain, who is retired from a career as a teacher and university lecturer.  The Strathmartine ballot paper is completed by Naveed Ali for the Conservatives, Callum Baird for the Greens and Donald Macleod for the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition.  As stated earlier, Votes at 16 apply for these by-elections; and remember to rank the candidates on your ballot paper in order of preference.
</p><p>
Coming next week: 20 (twenty) by-elections in one of the busiest days this column has ever seen. Stay tuned for that.
