<!-- Andrew's previews continue to be historical and electoral tours de force. - Lord Hayward -->

One by-election on Monday 16th September 2024:
</p><p>
<h2>Bestwood St Albans</h2>
</p><p>
Gedling council, Nottinghamshire; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Des Gibbons.
</p><p>
Yes, it's a Monday.  So why not hold a by-election?  It's only tradition that says by-elections have to be held on Thursdays; any working day will do.  In this case, the by-election is to Gedling council who have a full council meeting in the diary for Wednesday, so holding this poll today will enable the new councillor for Bestwood St Albans ward to hit the ground running.
</p><p>

</p><p>
The Gedling council area is based on the towns of Arnold and Carlton, which to all intents and purposes are part of Nottingham but have never been incorporated into the city.  Nottingham is one of several English cities whose boundaries are woefully out of date and don't include anywhere near the whole of their built-up area.
</p><p>
For example, let's consider the parish of St Albans, Nottinghamshire, which covers the Nottingham overspill development of Warren Hill.  This whole area of housing is indistinguishable from Nottingham on the ground and it can only be accessed by road from Nottingham.  But its original developer was Arnold Urban District council, and St Albans is a separate parish (established 2018) within the Gedling dsitrict of Nottinghamshire.
</p><p>
The name of St Albans parish relates to the descendants of Nell Gwyn via her lover Chales II.  Charles let the former royal hunting residence of Bestwood Lodge to her, and he granted the tile of Duke of St Albans to their illegitimate son Charles Beauclerk.  (The Child Support Agency wouldn't accept that these days as child support, but standards were different then.)  Bestwood Lodge remained in the hands of the Dukes of St Albans until around 1900, and the current lodge was built in 1863 for the 10th Duke.  That building is now a country house hotel.
</p><p>
Some of the old hunting area survives in the form of Bestwood Country Park, although don't be fooled.  Much of the open space was once occupied by Bestwood Colliery, the world's first mine to extract a million tons of coal in a year; this pit closed in 1967, and the land has been extensively landscaped since then.  The headstock and winding engine house, complete with the steam engine that winched all that coal out, are still in situ as a reminder of times past.  Also still here is Bestwood Village, which greatly expanded in the late 19th century to serve the colliery, an ironworks and a glue factory; with most of that gone, Bestwood Village is now an increasingly attractive location for Nottingham commuters.  The Bestwood Village parish also includes Killarney Park, a rather isolated "gated" residential community for the retired.
</p><p>
Since 2015 the parishes of Bestwood Village and St Albans have combined to form the Bestwood St Albans ward of Gedling council.  Previously the St Albans area had been part of the Bonington ward of Arnold town, which was a closely-fought marginal; whereas Bestwood Village was a strong Labour area.  The combined ward split its two seats between Labour and the Conservatives in 2015, but Labour have pulled away since then: the 2023 election had a Labour lead of 52-31.
</p><p>
The area is part of the Gedling parliamentary seat, which in recent years has been a Labour-inclined marginal thanks partly to the local popularity of long-serving MP Vernon Coaker, who deputy headmaster at the school now known as Oakwood Academy before his election to Parliament in 1997.  Coaker went on to serve until 2019, often on small majorities; he was subsequently elevated to the Lords, and he is now a junior minister at the Ministry of Defence.  After one term in Conservative hands in 2019-24, the Gedling constituency swung hard to Labour in 2024: Michael Payne, who was deputy leader of the Labour-controlled Gedling council before making it to the green benches, won the seat in July by 11,881 votes.  That's a far larger majority than Coaker ever enjoyed.
</p><p>
Michael Payne is also a Nottinghamshire county councillor representing Arnold North division, which includes St Albans parish.  This division swung to Labour against both the national and local trend, as the Conservatives gained control of the county council that year.  Bestwood Village parish is part of the rural Newstead county council division, which is strongly Conservative.
</p><p>
Gedling council is controlled by Labour, who have a chance to increase their council majority at this by-election by recovering a defection loss.  The outgoing councillor is Des Gibbons, who quit the party last November over Gaza and sat as an independent for a while before eventually stepping down from the council in August.  Gibbons had served this ward since 2019.
</p><p>
Defending this by-election for Labour is John Taylor, who lives in the ward and appears to be fighting his first election campaign.  The Conservatives have selected Darren Maltby, who appeared in this column at another Gedling council by-election two years ago; he works for the Royal British Legion supporting disabled and vulnerable armed forces veterans.  Patrick Shannon, for the Liberal Democrats, is the only other candidate to stand.
