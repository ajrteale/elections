Two by-elections on Tuesday 24th September 2024:
</p><p>
<h2>Godalming Binscombe and Charterhouse</h2>
</p><p>
Waverley council, Surrey; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Nick Palmer.
</p><p>
A busy autumn of by-election continues today with two Tuesday by-elections.  It's unusual for by-elections to be held otherwise than on a Thursday; the last occasion when Andrew's Previews covered two Tuesday polls was in 2021, with two elections to Broadland council in Norfolk.
</p><p>
Today we're in the Wey Valley in Surrey, to the south of Guildford.  Godalming has been a market town since 1300, originally deriving its wealth from the wool industry and from passing trade on the road between London and Portsmouth.  The railways came here in 1849; originally Godalming was a branch-line terminus, before the Portsmouth Direct line was completed in 1859.  The town is divided into four wards for Waverley council elections, with Binscombe and Charterhouse lying north of the River Wey and covering the north-west quadrant of the town.
</p><p>

</p><p>
The Charterhouse in the ward name refers to Charterhouse School, which relocated here in 1872.  Charterhouse is a distinguished public school which was founded in the City of London in 1611, and on its previous site it educated the nineteenth-century Prime Minister Lord Liverpool.  It's one of the two polling stations for this by-election.  The list of Old Carthusians is a long one as might be expected.  Famous pupils educated here in Godalming include the veteran broadcasters David and Jonathan Dimbleby, the <em>Channel 4 News</em> presenter Cathy Newman (who has spoken out about sexual harassment and humiliation which she experienced at the school), the composer Ralph Vaughan Williams, the BBC Radio 4 character Giles Wemmbley-Hogg, and the A1 and (it turns out) Subwoolfer singer Ben Adams.

</p><p>
The Charterhouse school buildings have stood in for the Palace of Westminster in a number of recent film and TV series, including the BBC's <em>The Bodyguard</em> and Netflix' <em>The Crown</em>.  Appropriately enough, Godalming's representative in Parliament is an Old Carthusian himself.  Jeremy Hunt was head boy at the school before going on to Magdalen College, Oxford, a successful business career and a high-profile political career.  Hunt was first elected to the green benches in 2005 as MP for South West Surrey, and he was in Cabinet for most of the last 14 years of Conservative government (with the exception of the Johnson administration): he served for nearly six years as health secretary, he was foreign secretary in 2018-19, and he was runner-up to Boris Johnson in the 2019 Conservative leadership election.  In the last chaotic days of the Truss administration, Jeremy Hunt returned to the frontline as Chancellor of the Exchequer: he served in that role throughout the Sunak premiership, and still serves as Shadow Chancellor in opposition.
</p><p>
Jeremy Hunt can take some personal pride in being re-elected in July while his fellow Surrey MPs were falling like ninepins.  His vote tally of 23,293 in the newly-drawn constituency of Godalming and Ash was one of the highest for any Conservative general election candidate this year, and it needed to be: the seat's Lib Dem candidate was only 891 votes behind.
</p><p>
The Liberal Democrats were building here on their local strength.  They are the largest party on Waverley council, which is based on Godalming and also takes in the town of Farnham and a large chunk of North Downs countryside.  Waverley council has been run since 2019 by a coalition of all the non-Conservative councillors, with the major players being the Lib Dems and the Farnham Residents party.
</p><p>
Recent elections to Waverley council have had more than a whiff of Progressive Alliance going on in their candidate lists, and the 2023 result for the three seats in Godalming Binscombe and Charterhouse ward saw a losing Conservative slate of three opposed by one winning candidate each from the Lib Dems, the Green Party and Labour.  By the standard "top candidate" method of reckoning shares of the vote the vote shares come out at 29% for the Lib Dems, 27% for the Greens, 23% for Labour and 21% for the Conservatives, which is clearly a misleading state of affairs given that the top three parties effectively functioned as one slate.  The result of the 2021 Surrey county council election in the local division of Godalming North - 60% for the Lib Dems, 30% for the Conservatives, 10% for Labour - tells a rather different picture.  Progressive Alliance stuff can get you into trouble because different parties exist for a reason, and the ward's Green councillor Stephen Williams was recently thrown out of the party for endorsing the local Lib Dem candidate in the general election.
</p><p>
Godalming Binscombe and Chrarterhouse ward's former Labour councillor is notable for different reasons.  Nick Palmer served in Parliament from 1997 to 2010 as the Labour MP for Broxtowe in Nottinghamshire.  Before entering the Commons Palmer was a computer scientist who co-founded a magazine dedicated to board games, and while still an MP he won the <em>Diplomacy</em> title at the 2007 World Boardgaming Championships.  In 2019 Palmer was elected to Waverley council as one of the borough's first Labour councillors this century, and he became leader of the Labour group (of two).  He resigned from the council in August because he had moved to Oxfordshire, and last week he finished in 14th place (out of 27) in the Labour party's National Executive Committee elections.
</p><p>
This appears to be the first Labour by-election defence in the Surrey county council area since November 2014.  Labour need to hold the seat to keep group status on Waverley council, and it's likely to be a difficult defence for their candidate Ben Knight.  He lives in the ward and runs a small business doing market and social research.  Britain Elects' ward-level projection of the 2024 general election votes reckons that the Lib Dems carried this ward in July, and they will be looking for a gain with their candidate James Barratt, who has a project management role at a local charity.  Trying to pick up the pieces for the Waverley branch of the Green Party is David Faraday, who runs a training firm.  And don't count out the Conservatives' Daniel Husseini, who was an unsuccessful candidate for this ward last year and is involved with the Godalming branch of the Rotary Club.  Those are your four candidates.

<h2>Thurston</h2>
</p><p>
Mid Suffolk council; caused by the resignation of Green Party councillor Austin Davies.
</p><p>
<img alt="M Suffolk, Thurston" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/m-suffolk-thurston-2024.png">
</p><p>
Our other poll today is for a rural ward in East Anglia.  Thurston is a large village roughly in the centre of Suffolk, a few miles to the east of Bury St Edmunds.  This was an important place in mediaeval times as the centre of Thedwastre Hundred, one of the ancient hundreds of Suffolk; "Theodward's Tree", which no longer exists today, stood in Thurston.
</p><p>
Modern local administration here is based in the Cavendish Hall, which is home to Thurston parish council and is a polling station for today's by-election.  It was gifted to the people of Thurston in 1913 by Julia Cavendish, an American who had married a British businessman called Tyrell Cavendish.  The Cavendishes had bought the hall just before embarking on a trip to America as first-class passengers on the maiden voyage of the RMS <em>Titanic</em>.  Julia was rescued from one of the ship's lifeboats, but Tyrell didn't survive the disaster.
</p><p>
Thurston and four other parishes around it form part of Mid Suffolk council, whose largest town is Stowmarket although the council offices are based closer to Ipswich in Needham Market.  Mid Suffolk council made history in the 2023 local elections as the first council ever to return a majority of Green Party councillors: the district's voters elected 24 Green councillors against 6 Conservatives and 4 Lib Dems.  This wasn't a flash in the pan: the Greens had first returned a Mid Suffolk councillor in 2003, and they had been the largest opposition group on the council since the Lib Dems collapsed in 2015.
</p><p>
The Suffolk Greens built on that strength to win the Waveney Valley constituency in July's general election.  That seat contains a large chunk of Mid Suffolk district, but not Thurston which is included within the Bury St Edmunds and Stowmarket constituency.  In perhaps an even more surprising turn of events, Bury St Edmunds and Stowmarket is a Labour seat: Peter Prinsley, an otorhinolaryngologist and Norwich city councillor, defeated Rishi Sunak's chief of staff Will Tanner by 1,452 votes in July.  Prinsley, who is in his late 60s, is one of the oldest members of the new Parliamentary intake.
</p><p>
When looking at local elections, there's not much obvious Labour strength in Thurston ward.  The ward was drawn up for the 2019 local elections when it split its two seats between the Greens and the Conservatives.  The Green councillor resigned at the end of 2021 because she was relocating to Sheffield, and the Greens held the resulting by-election in February 2022 (<em>Andrew's Previews 2022</em>, page 61) with a massive lead over the Conservatives of 64-30.  In 2023 the Green Party gained the other seat in Thurston ward from the Conservatives by 55-30; the Tories only had one candidate for the two available seats, which doesn't say much for the state of their local party organisation.
</p><p>
Thurston ward is split between the two Thedwastre divisions of Suffolk county council, which both turned in close results when they were last contested in 2021.  Thurston itself is in Thedwastre South, which the Lib Dems narrowly held, while Stowlangtoft and other villages in the ward along the A1088 Stowmarket-Thetford road are in Thedwastre North which the Greens narrowly gained.  In both divisions the Conservatives were a close second; the Greens didn't stand in Thedwastre South in 2021.
</p><p>
This by-election is to replace Green councillor Austin Davies, who won the 2022 by-election and was re-elected for a full term in 2023.  He is moving away from the area.  The defending Green Party candidate this time is Oscar Barrick-Cook, who has recently completed his A-levels and works for an independent menswear brand.  The Conservatives have reselected Harry Richardson, who was their ward councillor here in 2019-23 and was deputy leader of Mid Suffolk council from 2022 until he lost his seat last year.  Nathan Hope, for Labour, is the only other candidate.
