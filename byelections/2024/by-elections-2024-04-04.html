Three by-elections on 4th April 2024:

<h2>Desborough</h2>

North Northamptonshire council; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Mike Tebbutt.

Our three polls today are all in small-town England.  We'll start by considering Desborough, a Northamptonshire town roughly halfway between Kettering and Market Harborough.  Like many small Northamptonshire towns, Desborough was quite an industrial centre: and in this case not just for shoemaking, because there was also a textile industry here.  The town specialised in manufacturing lingerie, and the old Victorian Co-op corset factory is still in business today: now trading as Wacoal, the factory makes bras, lingerie and swimwear in Desborough under the Fantasie and Freya brands.

Despite this, Desborough is small enough that it's now rather off the beaten track.  The town is on the Midland main line from London to Leicester, but its railway station was closed by Beeching: to get to Desborough by public transport, as your columnist once had to do, you need to go to Kettering and catch a bus from there.  A road bypass for the town then opened in 2003, taking A6 long-distance traffic out of the town centre.

The present Desborough ward also takes in eight other parishes in rolling hills to the north of the town.  The largest of these is Wilbarston, which lies on the main road between Corby and Market Harborough.  According to the notice of poll for this by-election Wilbarston has 534 electors; this compares with a total of 8,727 for Desborough's four polling districts.

These ward boundaries were drawn up in 2013 for elections to what was then Northamptonshire county council, and were then reused in 2021 for the inaugural elections to North Northamptonshire council which took over as local authority from the bankrupt county council and from Kettering council.  All three elections on these lines to date have returned Conservatives, although not always safely so.  The 2013 election saw a very fragmented result with the Conservatives winning on just 28%; the outgoing Conservative county councillor sought re-election as an independent and polled 26%, UKIP had 18% and Labour 17%.  The 2017 county council election was also close, with 42% for the Conservatives, 36% for Labour and 12% for the Lib Dems.

For the 2021 North Northamptonshire elections the number of councillors here was increased from one to three.  All three seats were won fairly easily by the Conservative slate, which polled 40% of the vote against 28% for Labour and 14% for an independent candidate.  The Labour share here includes a boost from the personal vote of veteran local politician Phil Sawford, who had been leader of Kettering council from 1991 to 1997 and then Labour MP for Kettering from 1997 to 2005.  Sawford had started his career in elected office right here in 1977, when he was elected to Desborough town council; he returned to the town council in 2018 and still sits on it to this day.  He featured in this column in December 2019, as the Labour candidate for the last Kettering council by-election in Desborough St Giles ward (<em>Andrew's Previews 2019</em>, page 399).

Phil Sawford was defeated in Kettering in 2005 by right-wing Conservative Philip Hollobone, who has served five terms as MP for Kettering since then and will defend a large majority at the next general election.  There is also a large Conservative majority on North Northamptonshire council, although the ruling group have lost two seats in by-elections since the 2021 election here.  North Northamptonshire is next due for re-election in 2025, although there will be polls here in a month's time for Northamptonshire police and crime commissioner.

This by-election is to replace Conservative councillor Mike Tebbutt following his death in January at the age of 85.  Tebbutt was another political veteran who had served on Kettering council since 2003 - representing Desborough St Giles ward - before transferring to North Northamptonshire in 2021.  He clearly enjoyed a large personal vote in the town, because he outpolled his two Conservative running-mates who were higher up the alphabetical ballot paper.

Defending for the Conservatives is Bill McElhinney, who is a local businessman, qualified accountant and Desborough town councillor.  Hoping to come out of political retirement is Labour candidate Rikki Tod, who has lived in the town for 50 years; he previously served as a Labour member of Kettering council, representing St Giles ward in Desborough from 1995 to 2003.  The independent candidate from last time has not returned, so completing this ballot paper are Alan Window for the Lib Dems and Olivia Stevenson for the Green Party.

<h2>Uckfield New Town</h2>

Wealden council, East Sussex; caused by the disqualification of independent councillor Spike Mayhew.

Perhaps our most urban by-election of the week comes in Uckfield, a town located on the River Uck in central Sussex.  This was the point where the pilgrimage route between Canterbury, Chichester and Lewes crossed the Uck, and a town grew up on both sides of a bridge to serve the pilgrims: the original town centre to the north, then the New Town to the south.  The bridge is close to Uckfield's railway station, which was once on a secondary line to Lewes but is now a branch line terminus: the Uckfield branch is unusual on the Southern Railway network for not being electrified, and the hourly trains from here to London Bridge use diesel power.  The town once lay on the main road from London to Eastbourne, which now bypasses Uckfield to the west.

Uckfield is perhaps best known to the outside world for the way the River Uck floods the town every few years.  The floods of autumn 2000 were particularly destructive, and led to the town being featured on the cover of the 2017 Ladybird Expert book on Climate Change - a book which was co-written by the future Charles III.

Uckfield's most famous son of recent years is Rory Graham, who performs music under the name Rag'n'Bone Man.  His 2016 debut single <em>Human</em> was very successful: it went to number 1 across Europe, peaked at number 2 on the UK singles chart (losing the Christmas number 1 spot to Clean Bandit's <em>Rockabye</em>) and has been certified four times platinum in the UK.  Seven years on, it's stood the test of time.

Since it's Easter week and He is Risen, we should also mention this rather controversial 2009 statue of Christ which is attached to the belltower of Uckfield's Catholic church, dedicated to Our Lady Immaculate and St Philip Neri.  It rather quickly became known in the media as "Jesus in Jeans".

South-east England is a winner from the parliamentary boundary changes, which reflects population movements within England over the last 20 years.  Accordingly, from the next general election Uckfield will be transferred into a new parliamentary seat called East Grinstead and Uckfield, which should be safely Conservative even given the party's current dire polling.  This new seat is one of two descendants of the old Mid Sussex constituency, and it will be contested at the next election by the outgoing Conservative Mid Sussex MP Mims Davies: she was first elected for that seat in 2019 after serving two terms as MP for Eastleigh, and she is currently on the lower rungs of government within the DWP ministerial team.

Things are less rosy for the Conservatives in Uckfield at local level.  The Uckfield New Town ward is divided between two East Sussex county council divisions, which both voted Conservative in 2021 but not with particularly convincing majorities: Uckfield North had a strong Lib Dem second-place performance, while Labour performed relatively well in Uckfield South with Framfield.

Then in 2023 there was a seachange in the composition of Wealden district council, where the Conservatives collapsed from majority control to fourth place.  The latest composition has 13 Lib Dems, 11 Green councillors, 9 independents plus this vacancy, 9 Conservatives and 2 Labour councillors, with the Lib Dems and Greens forming a coalition to run the show.  One of the Labour seats came in the previously-Conservative ward of Uckfield New Town, where the party had narrowly missed out on one seat in 2019 and narrowly missed out on two in 2023; shares of the vote were 44% for the Labour slate, 30% for independent candidate Barry "Spike" Mayhew, and 26% for the Conservatives.

In the eleven months since in May 2023 Wealden councillor Spike Mayhew attended only one meeting of the council, with a critical story in the <em>Brighton Argus</em> reporting (<a href="https://www.theargus.co.uk/news/24185365.uckfield-councillor-missed-meetings-partying-butlins/">link</a>) that he had skipped two meetings to go on a Norwegian cruise and a friend's 60th birthday bash at Butlin's without even sending apologies for absence.  Eventually, in February, he was disqualified under the six-month non-attendance rule.

One independent councillor has come forward to succeed Mayhew: Donna French is an Uckfield town councillor who runs a fancy dress company in the town.  Labour have selected George Wilson, who was runner-up here last year 21 votes behind Mayhew.  Standing for the Conservatives is Helen Firth, who was previously a councillor for this ward from 2011 until she lost her seat in 2023.  No-one else has come forward, so those are your three candidates.

<h2>Looe West, Pelynt, Lansallos and Lanteglos</h2>

Cornwall council; caused by the death of Liberal Democrat councillor Edwina Hannaford.

We now come to the south coast of Cornwall, a place where people have been coming for many centuries.  And not always just for the weather.  Looe Island, one of the few islands off Cornwall's south coast, has been home to a number of places of Christian worship over the centuries; local legend has it that Jesus himself visited here as a child in the company of his uncle Joseph of Arimathea, and some scholars have identified Ictis, which Diodorus of Siculus described as a pre-Roman centre for the Cornish tin trade, with Looe Island.

Today Looe Island is maintained as a nature reserve by the Cornwall Wildlife Trust, who organise day trips by boat in summer from the town of Looe.  Well, in some sense this is two towns either side of the joint estuary of the East Looe and West Looe rivers.  Looe punched above its weight in the Middle Ages as a major Cornish port, with exports of tin and granite being particularly profitable.

Partly because of the tin industry, Cornwall was the most over-represented part of the pre-reform House of Commons.  Of the 56 boroughs which were completely disenfranchised by the Great Reform Act of 1832, 12 were in Cornwall.  Four other Cornish boroughs were reduced from two MPs to one, leaving a total of 28 MPs to be redistributed from Cornwall to the new and growing towns of the Industrial Revolution.  Looe formed not just one but two of the disenfranchised boroughs, because the town was divided into two separate parliamentary boroughs called East Looe and West Looe.

The electors of West Looe were the mayor and the other 11 members of the town corporation, plus a handful of free burgesses who were appointed by the corporation; at the time of the 1831 election, West Looe had a population of 593 but only 19 voters.  In practice, elections here were controlled by the Trelawny family and later the Buller family, and there was normally a Buller or a Trelawny among West Looe's MPs.  There was only one contested election in the final 132 years of West Looe's existence as a parliamentary borough: that was a 1765 by-election, which the Bullers' candidate won.  Notable names to have represented the borough include the first Earl of Ranelagh, who was expelled from the Commons in 1703 for appropriating more than £900,000 of public funds in his lucrative role as paymaster of the forces; John Mountstephen, who committed suicide in 1706 after it was revealed that he had sold state secrets to the French; Edward Trelawny, whose election here in 1734 was voided on the grounds that he was a commissioner of customs, and who later served for twelve years as governor of Jamaica; the early 18th-century admiral Sir Charles Wager, who had an estate in West Looe; Sir Benjamin Keene, in between his two spells as British ambassador to Spain; and Sitwell Sitwell, so good they named him twice, a Derbyshire landowner who represented West Looe from 1796 to 1802.

Today Cornwall has no parliamentary boroughs and only six members of Parliament.  Looe now forms part of the South East Cornwall constituency, which has been in Conservative hands since 2010 and where Conservative backbencher Sheryll Murray will soon seek a fifth term of office.

West Looe is part of an electorsl ward which takes in parishes along the coast to the west and whose name seems to grow ever longer at every Cornish boundary review.  Lansallos is an ancient village in the parish of Polperro, a fishing port which was once so isolated and interbred that in 1903 the polymath Francis Galton proved that fingerprints were unique to each individual and not inheritable by taking and comparing the fingerprints of everyone living in Polperro.  The parish of Lanteglos, which was added to this ward in 2013, lies further to the west opposite the fishing port of Fowey.  The most recent addition is Pelynt parish, which has been part of this ward since 2021; it includes the manor of Trelawne, the traditional home of the Trelawny baronets and now a centre for holiday accommodation and entertainment.

Whatever the name of this ward, it had been represented since the creation of the modern Cornwall council in 2009 by the Liberal Democrats' Edwina Hannaford, who started her political career in 2003 on Looe town council and had served as mayor of Looe.  Hannaford had been a member of the Cornwall council cabinet from 2013 until the Conservatives gained overall control of the council in 2021, after which she became leader of the Lib Dem group until her death in February.  Her final re-election in 2021 was by the very comfortable margin of 61-30 over the Conservatives.

The defending Lib Dem candidate in this by-election also has long political experience.  Jim Candy is a retired farmer who was first elected in a September 2004 by-election to the old Caradon council as the Lib Dem councillor for Deviock and Sheviock ward: he served until that council's abolition in 2009, and then served on the modern Cornwall council from 2013 to 2017 as councillor for Trelawny ward which Pelynt was then part of.  The Conservative candidate is Richard Dorling, who is a Liskeard town councillor.  Also standing are Amy Ladd for Labour and Paul Clark for the Green Party.
