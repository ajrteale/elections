Eight by-elections, for nine seats, on 19th September 2024:
</p><p>
<h2>Falmouth Penwerris</h2>
</p><p>
Cornwall council; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Jayne Kirkham.
</p><p>
We're going through a glut of council by-elections at the moment caused by the massive new intake of new (mostly Labour) MPs who were elected in July resigning their council seats.  This week's eight by-elections are for six Labour and three Conservative seats, and five of the departing Labour councillors have gone to Parliament.  That will account for the entire first half of this week's Preview.
</p><p>
One of the newbies on the green benches is Jayne Kirkham, who in July gained the Truro and Falmouth constituency for the Conservatives by 8,151 votes.  Kirkham had previously contested that seat in 2017 without success, and at the time of her election she was the leader of the rather small Labour group on Cornwall council.

</p><p>
Kirkham has departed from her division of Falmouth Penwerris, which covers the northern part of the town of Falmouth along the banks of the Penryn River; the High Street and North Parade are within the ward.  Falmouth's economy has changed a lot in recent years with the establishment of Falmouth University, which was granted its full status in 2012.  The University had previously been an arts college, and its list of alumni is therefore dominated by artists; graduates of its journalism course include the BBC News health editor Hugh Pym and newsreader Sophie Long.  Today many of Falmouth University's students live in Penwerris ward, which is in the top 100 wards in the UK for those educated to A-level or equivalent (30.4%) and for those of no religion (58.3%).
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/cornwall21.png" alt="Cornwall, 2021" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Penwerris ward was established along with the modern Cornwall council in 2009.  Frequent boundary changes make comparisons difficult, but the ward has returned four different councillors in its four ordinary elections to date: it returned an independent in 2009 (with just 28% of the vote), voted Labour in 2013, Liberal Democrat in 2017 and Labour again in 2021.  Jayne Kirkham's win three years ago was by 64-20 over the Conservatives, an unusually decisive margin for a ward which had been won by under 40% at its previous elections.
</p><p>
Cornwall council as a whole was gained by the Conservatives in 2021, with a small majority of 45 out of 87 seats.  The party has since lost a by-election to the Lib Dems, and whether they still have a majority or not depends on how you count one councillor who has officially left the Tories but is still part of their county council group.  There's no chance of the Conservatives resolving that situation by gaining the Felmouth Penwerris by-election, because surprisingly they have no candidate here.
</p><p>
In the unusual position for an R of the top of the ballot paper is the defending Labour candidate Alan Rowe, the mayor of Falmouth, who according to the town council website works for Plymouth city council as "an Operations Manager dealing with arboricultural issues".  This biography might well make Rowe public enemy number 1 in Plymouth, following the well-publicised massacre of the trees on Armada Way in Plymouth city centre last year.  As stated the Conservatives are not standing despite their second place here in 2021, so Rowe's opposition comes from Jackie Walkden for the Green Party and John Spargo for the Lib Dems.

<h2>Marine</h2>
</p><p>
Worthing council, West Sussex; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Rebecca Cooper.
</p><p>
We stay on the south coast for our second by-election, which is in a ward this column has visited three times before.   Although we do have to double-check we have the right Marine ward here: there are three Marine wards in West Sussex, of which this ward on the Worthing seafront is the middle one. The other two are in Bognor Regis and Shoreham by Sea.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/gedling-bestwood-st-albans.png" alt="Gedling, Bestwood St Albans" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
This Marine ward is in western Worthing, taking its name from Marine Gardens on the seafront. The ward runs north from there, through 1930s housing along Grand Avenue and George V Avenue, to the West Coastway railway line (between West Worthing and Durrington-on-Sea stations).
</p><p>
Worthing has a very long history: in the fourth millennium BC this was Britain's largest flint-mining area, and archaeologists have had a lot of fun excavating the local prehistoric hill forts. The town as we know it started up as a seaside resort in the eighteenth century.  But there's more to Worthing than the beach: the town has managed to escape the declining fate of many seaside resorts by successfully diversifying its economy. The local water company Southern Water, the pharmaceutical giant Glaxo SmithKline and a large HM Revenue and Customs office provide year-round employment. And the town has changed demographically in recent years: it has become a popular place to live for people of working age who have been priced out of London and Brighton. A number of the seaside resorts in Sussex are forgotten towns, elephants' graveyards or both: Worthing is neither.
</p><p>
The Marine ward has had unchanged boundaries since at least 1983. There were were 22 elections here between that year and 2010, all of which resulted in a Conservative win (usually very comfortably) over the Lib Dems in second place. Then from 2011 onwards this demographic change and the formation of the Coalition combined in unexpected ways. Labour took over second place in 2011 and 2012, UKIP were runners-up in 2014 and 2015, Labour again in 2016.
</p><p>
In 2017 one of Marine ward's Conservative councillors, Joan Bradley, resigned on health grounds. Unfortunately, she died before the resulting by-election took place in August 2017.  Looking back at what this column wrote then (Andrew's Previews 2017, page 211), I did not see what was coming.
</p><p>
 The Labour candidate Beccy Cooper, fresh from contesting the local parliamentary seat of Worthing West in the general election two months previously, pulled off a stunning swing of 17% from the Conservatives to win the by-election by a 47-39 margin. Let's put this result into context: Labour had never polled over 20% in this ward before, never mind over 40%, and there had never previously been a Labour councillor elected from any ward in Worthing.
</p><p>
The 2017 Marine by-election broke the mould of Worthing politics. Suddenly, Labour became the main challengers in a number of the town's wards. In the May 2018 election they won 4 seats; they won 5 more seats in 2019, the same figure as the Conservatives. All of those were gains.
</p><p>
That red wave also extended to West Sussex county council in the 2021 elections. Three of the town's county councillors are now Labour, including Beccy Cooper who gained Worthing West division (which includes this ward) from the Conservatives.  In the simultaneous Worthing council elections Labour gained five more seats from the Conservatives, forcing the council into No Overall Control, while Beccy Cooper was also re-elected for a second term in Marine ward. All of those Labour gains were on small majorities, and Marine was no exception: Cooper's majority fell to 47-43.
</p><p>
In November 2021 an investigation by Hope Not Hate, an anti-fascist group, revealed that Marine ward Conservative councillor Tim Wills was a supporter of a far-right white nationalist group called Patriotic Alternative. After the council's monitoring officer had taken a look at the story, Wills was given an ultimatum by the Conservative leader of the council: either deny the allegations or resign. Wills chose to resign, and Labour gained the resulting by-election from the Conservatives in December 2021.
</p><p>
The following May Labour won ten of the 14 seats up for election in Worthing council and took overall control, with Beccy Cooper becoming leader of the council.  In less than six years, Labour had come from nowhere to a council majority.  And they don't look like relinquishing it any time soon: the latest composition, following the May 2024 elections, has 21 Labour councillors plus two vacancies against 9 Conservatives, 3 independents (all of whom were elected for Labour) and 2 Greens.  For those who have been following local elections for a long time, this is almost as dizzying a turn of events as this old viral video of Worthing seafront.
</p><p>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Xa4bHcJu8
</p><p>
Beccy Cooper stood down from the county council after she became leader of Worthing council in May 2022, and the resulting by-election in Worthing West division (which has similar boundaries to this ward) was easily held by Labour.  In May this year Cooper was re-elected for a third term on the council with a 56-31 lead over the Conservatives.  And in July Beccy Cooper was the Labour parliamentary candidate for Worthing West for the third time, and she won the seat by 3,949.  The previous Conservative MP for Worthing West, Sir Peter Bottomley, now has the dubious distinction of being the only serving Father of the House ever to seek re-election and lose.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2024/worthing24.png" alt="Worthing, 2024" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Who knows where Beccy Cooper's remarkable electoral career will take her next?  Well, having gone to Westminster she has relinquished her council seat, so it's time for the third Marine ward by-election this column has covered.  This time the defending Labour candidate is Mary Mernagh, who contested Durrington ward in May's local elections.   The Conservatives have selected Thomas Taylor, who chairs the local branch of the Young Conservatives.  Intending Conservative and Green voters should check which Taylor they are voting for, because the Green candidate is Jimi Taylor; he completes the ballot along with Nick Wiltshire for the Lib Dems and Lionel Harman for Reform UK.

<h2>Harrow Road; and<br>
West End</h2>
</p><p>
Westminster council, London; caused respectively by the resignations of Labour councillors Tim Roca and Jessica Toale.
</p><p>
Our London by-elections this week are to replace two new Labour MPs who are now based rather further from the centre of UK political power than they were before, having vacated their seats on Westminster city council.  Tim Roca and Jessica Toale are both the first-ever Labour MPs to represent their respective constituencies.  Roca is now the MP for his native Macclesfield in Cheshire with a majority of 9,120 votes, a seat which even in the Blair years had large majorities for the long-serving and locally-popular rightwinger Sir Nicholas Winterton.  Toale has gone to Dorset to represent Bournemouth West, where she defeated the controversial Conservative MP Sir Conor Burns by 3,224 votes in July.
</p><p>
PICTURE HERE
</p><p>
Jessica Toale has vacated one of the most iconic wards in the whole of the UK.  The West End ward of Westminster is truly the sort of place where all human life is here: the ward boundaries are Tottenham Court Road, Shaftesbury Avenue, Piccadilly, Park Lane, Edgware Road, Seymour Street, Wigmore Street and Portland Place.  Here we find the old money of Mayfair, the nightlife of Soho, the department stores of pre-pedestrianised Oxford Street, the tailors of Savile Row, a large chunk of the West End theatreland, part of the bohemian enclave of Fitzrovia, and the BBC complex at Broadcasting House.  There are nine Underground stations within or on the ward boundary, plus the new Elizabeth Line stations at Bond Street and Tottenham Court Road.
</p><p>

</p><p>
West End makes a large number of the top 100 ward lists from the 2021 census return, including 9th place for residents born in the EU-14 countries (18.4%) - not surprising for a ward which contains a large number of foreign embassies.  Perhaps more surprisingly given the West End's reputation as a centre for entertainment, for the people who live here the financial sector (14.4%) and real estate activities (3.7%) are particularly large employers.  Mayfair sets the tone of West End ward's local elections, and until the Conservatives lost their inner London vote base this was a safe Conservative ward.  Its former Conservative councillors include the future Grantham and Stamford MP Nick Boles and the <em>Daily Mail</em> journalist Glenys Roberts, who served the ward for 19 years.  Labour won one of the ward's three seats in 2018 and the other two (on new boundaries) in 2022, by a 49-40 margin over the Conservatives.  Jessica Toale MP was in her first term on the council.
</p><p>

</p><p>
A few miles and a world away we come to Harrow Road ward, which is based on the Maida Hill and West Kilburn areas of Paddington.  In some ways this ward's census return is similar to West End (massive numbers of flats, large proportion born in the EU), but Harrow Road contains some large council estates and it has always been a safe Labour ward in Westminster council elections.  In 2022 the Labour lead here was 72-18 over the Conservatives.  Harrow Road ward's previous councillors include Diane Abbott, the Mother of the House, who started her political career as a councillor in 1982-86, and the former Labour deputy leader of the Greater London Council Illtyd Harrington.  Tim Roca was first elected here in a 2015 by-election.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2022/westminster22.png" alt="Westminster, 2022" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Westminster city council voted in a Labour majority in 2022 for the very first time, and Hazma Taouzzale - who as Lord Mayor of Westminster in 2022-23 attended both the funeral of Elizabeth II and the coronation of Charles III - was the first Labour councillor, the first Muslim, and at 22 the youngest-ever person to hold that post.  In the May 2024 London Mayor and Assembly elections Labour gained the West Central constituency, which covers Westminster, from the Conservatives for the first time.
</p><p>
And now for the first time Labour holds both parliamentary seats for the city.  Rachel Blake is the new Labour MP for the Cities of London and Westminster seat which covers West End ward.  The city's other Parliamentary seat tends to be a favourite target of Boundary Commission tinkering: its current incarnation of Queen's Park and Maida Vale, which crosses the boundary with Brent borough and includes Harrow Road ward, was won in July by Georgia Gould.  Gould was previously the leader of Camden council while Blake was a Tower Hamlets councillor, and in the last month this column has covered the by-elections caused by both of them resigning from their former councils.  Now it's Westminster's turn in that regard.
</p><p>
Defending Harrow Road for Labour is Regan Hook, whose career background is in marketing and communications; her work has included London-wide campaigns for the Crimestoppers charity.  The Conservatives have selected Jonathan Goff, who stood in July's general election in the Greenwich and Woolwich constituency and used to work in Brussels as an independent communications consultant.  Also standing are Helen Toeman for the Lib Dems, independent candidate Abby-Jan Dharamsey (who stood in Queen's Park and Maida Vale at the general election and polled 1.6%), Faaiz Hasan for the Greens and Hoz Shafiei for the Workers Party.
</p><p>
In the marginal West End ward the defending Labour candidate is Fiona Parker, a journalist who has recently taken voluntary redundancy from the <em>Daily Mirror</em> after 29 years.  The Conservatives have reselected Tim Barnes, who lives in Soho and runs a charity helping people from deprived backgrounds to start a business and get ahead in life; he was previously a councillor for this ward from 2018 to 2022, and he was the Conservatives' losing parliamentary candidate for Cities of London and Westminster in July.  Completing the West End ballot paper are Phillip Kerle for the Lib Dems and Rajiv Sinha for the Green Party.

<h2>St Neots Eatons</h2>
</p><p>
Huntingdonshire council, Cambridgeshire; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Graham Welton.
</p><p>
We now travel up the A1 to the town of St Neots, which has a bit of a split identity.  St Neots' urban area is divided into two halves by the River Great Ouse, and until 1965 that river was a county boundary: Huntingdonshire lay on the east bank, Bedfordshire on the west bank. Until the Bedfordshire side became part of St Neots urban district in 1965, the Great North Road didn't pass through St Neots: instead it passed through the villages of Eaton Socon and Eaton Ford.  The county boundary now runs along the modern line of the A1.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/gedling-bestwood-st-albans.png" alt="Gedling, Bestwood St Albans" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
The name of Eaton Socon refers to an old administrative unit, a Soke, and until the 1930s there was an Eaton Socon rural district of Bedfordshire. But since then the area has changed out of all recognition. In the 1950s and 1960s Eaton Ford and Eaton Socon saw large amounts of new housing being built as a London overspill development, with the A1 and the East Coast Main Line providing fast links to the capital.
</p><p>
Having already been transferred from Bedfordshire to Huntingdonshire, Eaton Ford and Eaton Socon ended up in Cambridgeshire after the 1974 reorganisation which demoted Huntingdonshire to a district under Cambridgeshire county council.  Cambridgeshire has continued to grow strongly in population, and one result of that is that St Neots is now the centre of a constituency of its own.  The St Neots and Mid Cambridgeshire parliamentary seat turned into a fascinating marginal seat during the recent general election campaign, with no agreement between the various polling models as to the likely winner.  In the end it went to the Liberal Democrats, whose candidate Ian Sollom defeated the outgoing Conservative MP Anthony Browne by 4,648 votes.  Sollom and Browne had previously faced off in 2019 for the South Cambridgeshire constituency, which did not include St Neots.
</p><p>
Perhaps regular readers of Andrew's Previews might have seen this this Lib Dem gain coming.  This column was in St Neots last year covering a by-election to the county council in St Neots The Eatons division, which has very similar boundaries to this ward.  That seat had been left vacant by the death of long-serving localist county councillor Derek Giles of the St Neots Independent Group, which did not defend the by-election: the Lib Dems, who had not contested the division in 2021, went on to win that by-election.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2022/hunts22.png" alt="Hunts, 2022" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Huntingdonshire council has an unusual electoral cycle and the last local elections here were in 2022.  That year saw the Conservatives lose the council after 46 years of majority control.  They remain the largest party with 19 seats plus this vacancy, but they are outnumbered by 16 independent or localist councillors, 11 Lib Dems, 4 councillors for Labour and a Green councillor. A coalition of everyone but the Conservatives has been formed to run the council, under a Lib Dem leader.
</p><p>
There have been two elections so far on the current boundaries for St Neots Eatons ward.  The St Neots Independent Group had a big win in 2018, but 2022 was close three ways: 33% for the St Neots Independent Group, 31% for the Conservatives and 24% for the Lib Dems, with the Conservatives winning two seats to the St Neots Independent Group's one.  The Conservatives' Graham Welton was in his first term on the council when he passed away in June, aged 69.
</p><p>
To defend the St Neots Eatons by-election the Conservatives have indulged in a bit of nominative determinism by selecting Nigel Eaton, who contested St Neots Eynesbury ward in 2022.  The St Neots Independent Group are not contesting this by-election, but we do have two independent candidates on the ballot: Barry Chapman and Rob Simonis are both St Neots town councillors, with Simonis currently serving as deputy mayor.  The Lib Dem candidate is Alan Hunt.  Completing an all-male ballot paper are Andrew Seal for the Green Party and Harvey Woodhouse for Labour.

<h2>Sidemoor</h2>
</p><p>
Bromsgrove council, Worcestershire; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor (David) Graeme Stewart.
</p><p>
The only Labour defence this week which is not caused by a councillor being elected to Parliament comes in the Midlands.  We're in Bromsgrove, an old market town in northern Worcestershire which during the Industrial Revolution was a centre for nail-making and for the railways.  These days it's a commuter centre for the West Midlands, with the southern boundary of Birmingham not far away at all.  Sidemoor ward, named after an old village which has been swallowed up by the town's growth, lies to the north of the town centre.
</p><p>

</p><p>
The boundaries of Sidemoor ward include the offices of Bromsgrove council, where 24 years of Conservative majority rule ended with a hung council being elected in 2023.  The Conservatives are still the largest party but they only hold 11 seats, against 8 Labour, 7 independents and 5 Lib Dems; a Conservative and independent coalition is running show.  Sidemoor ward has voted Labour since the current boundaries were introduced in 2015, and in 2023 Labour had 46% here against 28% for the Lib Dems and 24% for the Conservatives - a poor result for the Tories, who had come close to winning in 2019.
</p><p>
Most of Sidemoor ward is in the Bromsgrove West county division, which was one of only three Worcestershire county council divisions to vote Labour in 2021; a small corner of the ward is within the Bromsgrove Central county division which the Lib Dems gained from the Conservatives that year.  The Bromsgrove parliamentary seat, which has the same boundaries as Bromsgrove council, remains in Conservative hands although they polled less than a third of the vote in July; new MP Bradley Thomas, previously leader of Wychavon council, defeated the former Labour MEP Neena Gill by 3,016 votes.
</p><p>
This by-election is to replace Labour councillor Graeme Stewart, who was first elected here in 2023 and stood down from the council in August.  The defending Labour candidate Jennifer Smith has worked in children's social care for two decades; in last year's Bromsgrove elections she contested Catshill South.  The Lib Dems have reselected James Clarke, a businessman who has managed and coached junior football teams in the town.  Standing for the Conservatives is Rita Dent, who was previously a Bromsgrove councillor from 1999 to 2019 when she lost her seat in Bromsgrove Central ward.  Peter Measham, for the Greens, completes the Sidemoor ballot paper.

<h2>Fairfield</h2>
</p><p>
Stockton-on-Tees council, County Durham; a double by-election caused by the resignations of Conservative councillors Alex Griffiths and Susan Scott.
</p><p>
We now travel to the only remaining Conservative constituency in north-east England.  Stockton West covers affluent western suburbs of Stockton-on-Tees and Thornaby, the middle-class town of Yarm, the new village of Ingleby Barwick and the countryside between Stockton and Darlington.  This is one of two constituencies (along with Bishop Auckland) to cross the River Tees, the traditional boundary between Yorkshire and County Durham.  It would be difficult to draw a stronger Conservative seat in the lower Tees valley, and Matt Vickers - who won the main predecessor seat of Stockton South in 2019 - definitely got lucky in the game of Boundary Commission roulette.  He was re-elected in Stockton West in July with a majority of 2,139 over Labour candidate Joe Dancey (Wes Streeting's partner).
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/gedling-bestwood-st-albans.png" alt="Gedling, Bestwood St Albans" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Some of Vickers' majority will have come out of Fairfield ward, which is a residential area on the western edge of Stockton-on-Tees.  The ward includes a number of schools and colleges, including the Ian Ramsey secondary school named after a former Bishop of Durham; its former pupils include a number of sportspeople including the former athlete and broadcaster Alison Curbishley.  Boundary changes for the 2023 election, which added a third councillor to Fairfield ward, brought in the Grangefield Academy which in previous incarnations educated the film director Sir Ridley Scott and the former Speaker of the Commons Horace Maybray-King.
</p><p>
In most circumstances Fairfield is a safe Conservative ward, or at least it was until long-serving ward councillors Bill Woodhead and Maurice Perry went independent and were re-elected as independent councillors in 2019.  They both stood for re-election in the expanded Fairfield ward in 2023, but didn't come particularly close to winning: the Conservative slate polled 42% against 27% for Labour and 23% for independents - there were six independent candidates for the ward's three seats last year, but only Woodhead, Perry and Perry's partner polled a significant score.  The Conservatives put in a good performance in the 2023 Stockton-on-Tees elections and became the largest party on the council, however they are short of a majority and Labour run the borough as a minority administration with the support of independent and localist councillors.  If Labour can gain both seats in this double by-election, their group will draw level with the Conservatives.
</p><p>
This poll was originally triggered by the resignation of Conservative councillor Susan Scott, who tendered her resignation in August over Islamophobic posts which she made on social media.  With preparations for the resulting by-election already underway, Alex Griffiths then took the opportunity to step down due to a change in personal circumstances and to be closer to his family; this allowed a single by-election to be held to fill two seats at once.  Griffiths and Scott were both in their first term on Stockton council.
</p><p>
There is a lot of interest in this by-election with eleven candidates standing for the two available seats.  The defending Conservative slate consists of Mohammed Mazi and Jack Miller; Mazi was a candidate for Stockton Town Centre ward in last year's local elections, while Miller unsuccessfully stood for election to Bromley council in London in 2022 and has recently moved to this area to take up a teaching job in Hartlepool.  Standing for Labour are Oli Hall and Stephen Jennings; Hall is a student reading international relations and politics at Northumbria University, while Jennings is an English teacher who contested Bishopsgarth and Elm Tree ward last year.  There are two independent candidates on the ballot: William Bell-Berry stood here in 2023 and finished in 13th and last place, while Charlton Gibben gives an address in the ward.  Also standing are Steve Matthews and Neil McCabe for Reform UK, Samuel Bradford for the Green Party, and Hadia Malik and Mo Waqas for the Lib Dems.

<h2>Burn Valley</h2>
</p><p>
Hartlepool council, County Durham; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Jonathan Brash.
</p><p>
We finish for the week with our final councillor-to-MP by-election.  In 2021 Hartlepool was the scene of that rare sight, a government gain in a parliamentary by-election, as Jill Mortimer was elected as the town's first Conservative MP since Commander John "Yangtse Incident" Kerans in 1959-64.  It was the electoral high point of the Johnson government, and goodness me has it been a long way down for the Conservatives since then.  Jill Mortimer is now an ex-MP, having finished third in her re-election campaign in 2024 behind second-placed Reform UK, as Labour regained Hartlepool with a majority of 7,698 votes.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/gedling-bestwood-st-albans.png" alt="Gedling, Bestwood St Albans" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
A big win for Jonathan Brash, who came to the green benches from a long career in Hartlepool local politics: he was first elected for the town's Burn Valley ward in 2006, retired in 2016 and returned in 2021.  The name of Burn Valley ward refers to a stream, the Burn Valley Beck, which runs south of the town centre towards Stranton where it disappears into a culvert.  Most of Burn Valley ward's electors live here, along Park Road to the west of West Hartlepool town centre.
</p><p>
The ward also extends east into a more industrial area including the large Camerons brewery, which was historically one of Hartlepool's largest employers.  In the north-east corner of the ward next to Hartlepool's railway station we find the Northern Studios, opened last year and described as the only large-scale film and TV studio complex in the north-east.  Next to the studios we find Church Street, whose buildings date from the earliest days of West Hartlepool in the mid-19th century.  Outside the eponymous church (which is now an art gallery) is a statue of that town's founder, Ralph Ward Jackson.
</p><p>

</p><p>
Since the 2021 parliamentary by-election Hartlepool's Labour party has come back strongly.  They made impressive gains in the 2023 council election forcing the Conservative-independent coalition to rely on the mayoral casting vote, and further strong gains in 2024 delivered a large Labour majority.  The current composition has 23 Labour seats plus this vacancy against 6 Conservatives, 4 independents and one councillor each from Hartlepool People and the Independent Union (the last remnant of the town's former UKIP group).
</p><p>
We see this recent Labour growth clearly in this decade's election results for Burn Valley ward.  In the 2021 local elections the ward's three seats split three ways between the Conservatives, an independent and Labour councillor Jonathan Brash.  Brash was easily re-elected in 2022, the ward's independent councillor was re-elected on the Labour ticket in 2023, and Labour gained the Conservative seat convincingly this year.  Shares of the vote here in May were 55% for Labour, 20% for the Conservatives and 16% for Reform UK.
</p><p>
With Jonathan Brash now off to Westminster, Labour have a by-election to defend here.  Their candidate is Owen Riddle, who works in the NHS and contested Fens and Greatham ward in May.  Surprisingly there is no Conservative candidate here, so keep an eye on the performance of Reform UK's Amanda Napper who was their parliamentary candidate here in July: she finished as runner-up then, and will be hoping for better this time.  Completing the ballot are candidates for two parties who haven't previously stood in the ward on these boundaries, Stephen Ashfield for the Green Party and Barry McKinstray for the Liberal Democrats.
