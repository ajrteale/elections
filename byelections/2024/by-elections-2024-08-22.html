</p><p>
The world of political science is mourning one of its great figures this week, with the announcement on Tuesday of the death of Professor David Denver.
</p><p>
An emeritus professor of politics at Lancaster University, Denver was a psephologist of the first rank who had been writing papers and books on elections in the UK for over five decades.  He know how to explain difficult concepts in simple terms, and his work <em>Elections and Voters in Britain</em>, cowritten with Robert Johns, became a well-known textbook in the subject and is now in its fourth edition.  Denver's first paper, on the subject of religion and voting, came out in 1970 in the journal <em>Political Studies</em>; his page on the Lancaster University website lists his most recent publication, from January this year, as a review of David Jeffery's book <em>Whatever Happened to Tory Liverpool?</em>.  His many works on the subject of constituency campaigning include an early article describing an controlled experiment in its efficacy, which involved the Labour Party campaigning hard in one particular Dundee towerblock while leaving a different block of flats in the city alone: Denver's conclusion was that such face-to-face canvassing did have beneficial effects for political parties.
</p><p>
David Denver has also left with us his collection, if not his understanding, of local elections in his native Scotland.  For decades he provided the Scottish chapters of the Local Government Elections Centre's semi-official collection of local election results, and one of his last pieces of work was to compile the December 2019 notional Westminster results on the new Scottish constituency boundaries.  Even in his final illness Denver was enjoying himself with advisory work for Boundaries Scotland, which is currently in the middle of drawing a new map for future Holyrood elections.
</p><p>
The former Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron, in his own tribute, described how a 1987 lecture from Professor Denver had inspired him to study politics at university.  There are many of today's psephologists who have met, worked with and/or been inspired by David Denver at some point.  His passing leaves a large hole: not just in Lancaster's politics department, but in the science of psephology as a whole.

<em>Requiescat in pace.</em>

<h2>Armadale and Blackridge</h2>
</p><p>
West Lothian council, Scotland; caused by the death of independent councillor Stuart Borrowman.
</p><p>
We'll start this week's column by discussing a ward in David Denver's home country, whose unusual voting patterns will no doubt have given him something to think about in putting together the notional December 2019 election result for the Bathgate and Linlithgow constituency.  It's our first proper free-for-all by-election of the 2024 Parliament.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/w-lothian-armadale-blackridge-2024.png" alt="W Lothian, Armadale/Blackridge" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Back in the eighteenth century, there was a village at the point where the Edinburgh-Glasgow turnpike road crossed a major north-south cattle droving route.  This village was called Barbauchlaw until 1790, when it fell into the hands of Sir William Honyman.  Honyman was a lawyer who became sheriff-depute of Lanarkshire in 1786, as well as being a major landowner in Sutherland and a big player in the politics of his native Orkney: his half-brother and two of his sons all served as MP for Orkney and Shetland.  In 1797 Honyman was appointed as a judge and took the judicial title of Lord Armadale, after the Sutherland village of Armadale which he owned.  The West Lothian village of Barbauchlaw was then renamed as Armadale, in his honour.
</p><p>
You can't get much more central in the Scottish central belt than Armadale, which lies roughly midway between Edinburgh and Glasgow on an old stagecoach route between them (now the A89 road).  This is an ex-mining town, which grew up in the Victorian era from being a small coaching village thanks to the area's coal and ironstone deposits.
</p><p>
The Edinburgh-Glasgow coaching road and the mining industry also spawned the town of Blackridge, locally pronounced and once spelt as "Blackrig", to the west of Armadale.  Armadale and Blackridge are both served by the railway line between Edinburgh and Glasgow via Bathgate, which reopened in December 2010 (although Armadale station was not ready until March 2011).  There is a half-hourly elcetric train service eastwards to Edinburgh and westwards to Glasgow and beyond.  Blackridge station is rather in the middle of nowhere - its site was once occupied by Westrigg Colliery - but maybe future development will change this.
</p><p>
The Armadale and Blackridge ward was created in 2007 and also takes in a rural area to the north, including the villages of Torphichen and Westhill.  West Lothian council has had unchanged ward boundaries since the introduction of proportional representation for Scottish local elections in 2007: strong population growth in Bathgate ward was simply dealt with by giving that ward a fourth councillor in 2012, and a boundary review for the 2017 election recommended no further change.
</p><p>
All four ordinary elections in Armadale and Blackridge to date have seen independent candidate Stuart Borrowman finish top of the poll, with the ward's three seats going to Borrowman, the SNP and Labour.  Stuart Borrowman was apparently notable enough for Wikipedia.  He was originally an SNP figure, serving in 2001 and 2002 as chief of staff to John Swinney (who was then, as now, leader of the Scottish National Party) before being elected in 2003 to West Lothian council in the old Easton ward.  Borrowman was then deselected by the SNP for the 2007 council elections, sought re-election as an independent and won re-election in first place with 25% of the vote.  He has proven to be wildly popular since then at the ballot box, and the most recent Armadale and Blackridge election in May 2022 gave him 49% of the vote against 22% for the SNP and 14% for Labour.  If there were two Stuart Borrowmans, he would have won two seats.
</p><p>
The only recent local poll here without Borrowman on the ballot was a by-election in March 2015, after the ward's Scottish National Party councillor lost her seat under the six-month non-attendance rule.  This was just before the major SNP victory at the 2015 Westminster election, and the SNP held the by-election: the Nationalists polled 43% of the first preferences against 27% for Labour and 20% for an independent candidate, and they held their seat easily in the final count with a 58-42 lead over Labour.  Five weeks later, the SNP's Martyn Day gained the Linlithgow and East Falkirk constituency from Labour on a 23% swing.
</p><p>
Seven weeks ago the Westminster results here went into reverse, as Labour gained the redrawn seat of Bathgate and Linlithgow from the SNP on a 22% swing.  Still trying to find her feet in London is the new Labour MP Kirsteen Sullivan, who was previously depute leader of West Lothian council where she represents the neighbouring Whitburn and Blackburn ward.
</p><p>
Sullivan had also been the Labour candidate in the 2021 Holyrood elections for the rather similar Linlithgow constituency, when she lost to SNP veteran Fiona Hyslop.  Hyslop is one of the few MSPs with continuous service since the re-establishment of the Scottish Parliament in 1999, having been a Lothian regional member before she won the Linlithgow constituency in 2011.  She has been in the Cabinet for most of the SNP's period in government since 2007, and she rejoined the frontbench in February 2024 as cabinet secretary for transport.
</p><p>
In between those two polls we had the 2022 West Lothian council elections, at which the SNP consolidated their position as the largest party by gaining seats from the Conservatives: the council's 33 seats split 15 to the SNP, 12 to Labour, 4 to the Conservatives, and one each to Stuart Borrowman and the Lib Dems.  The Labour group run West Lothian as a minority; as can be seen, there is a council majority for Unionist parties.
</p><p>
Stuart Borrowman died in May from a stroke, at the age of 71.  There is no independent candidate standing to replace him, so we have a free-for-all - and with 49% of the voters from 2022 having to go elsewhere, vote share changes here will be wild.  If we redistribute Borrowman's votes from 2022 then topline figures are 35% for the SNP, 31% for Labour and 21% for the Conservatives; in a three-seat ordinary election that would be one seat each for those three parties, while in a single-seat by-election Labour (as a fellow Unionist party) would pick up the Conservative transfers to win the head-to-head 53-47.  Rather a swing from the 2015 by-election which the SNP won, and Labour also have local momentum from the result of last month's Westminster election.
</p><p>
Standing for the SNP is Keith Barclay, who lives in Westhill - one of the minor villages within the ward.  Labour's Susan Manion comes to politics from a 40-year career in the NHS, which included the high-profile role of chief officer of health and social care for the Scottish Borders.  The Conservatives have gone for Douglas Smith who has appeared in this column before at two previous West Lothian council by-elections, most recently in Broxburn, Uphall and Winchburgh ward in December 2022.  Also standing are Adam Rafferty for the Scottish Green Party, Douglas Butler for the Liberal Democrats, John Hannah for the Independence for Scotland Party (whose signature policy is left as an exercise for the reader), and David McLennan for Reform UK.  This is a Scottish local by-election so Votes at 16 and the Alternative Vote apply: please mark the candidates on your ballot paper in order of preference.

<h2>Cramlington Eastfield</h2>
</p><p>
Northumberland council; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Christine Dunbar.
</p><p>
Last week we saw Labour defend three council by-elections, including two in wards which looked rather challenging on paper.  This week Andrew's Previews will have a more mixed menu, with the above free-for-all joined by defences from the Conservatives and Lib Dems.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/northd-cramlington-eastfield.png" alt="Northumberland, Cramlington Eastfield" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
For our Conservative defence this week we travel south to the only remaining council in north-east England which still has Conservative leadership.  It perhaps helps in this regard that the last local elections in Northumberland were all the way back in the good Conservative year of 2021, meaning that the Conservative members of Northumberland county council (along with Durham, where the Tories participate in the ruling coalition) has not yet had to face the wrath of ex-Conservative voters at the ballot box in the same way as the rest of the country.
</p><p>
The election night of December 2019, in which Ian Levy scored the night's first Conservative gain in the Blyth Valley constituency, feels a long time ago now.  Much of Levy's vote will have come out of Cramlington, which is in all but name a New Town around ten miles north of Newcastle upon Tyne.  Cramlington North is the number 1 ward in England and Wales for owner-occupation.  The neighbouring Cramlington Eastfield ward, which consists entirely of the 1970s and 1990s Eastfield housing estate on the eastern side of the town, is a bit further down the social scale with 13% of its households being socially rented, and it makes the top 70 wards in England and Wales for residents in "intermediate" occupations (16.4% of the workforce).
</p><p>
The 1970s local government reorganisation left Northumberland as one of England's largest counties by area and one of its smallest by population, which was exacerbated by the fact that most of Northumberland's residents are concentrated in its south-east corner leaving the rest of the county essentially empty.  In those days the parliamentary Boundary Commissions' rules included a clause on "special geographical considerations", which they invoked to round Northumberland up to four parliamentary seats despite its numerical entitlement being closer to three: this made the county's rural constituencies, while undersized in population terms, less unwieldy than they would otherwise have been.
</p><p>
For the boundary review just gone the "special geographical considerations" clause was removed in favour of numerical equality, which meant that at least one constituency would have to cross the border between Northumberland and the Tyne and Wear metropolitan county.  Thus was born the Parliamentary seat of Cramlington and Killingworth, which combined Cramlington with exurban parts of North Tyneside borough and Newcastle city to the south.  This was the main successor to Ian Levy's Blyth Valley seat, but the boundary changes wiped out his majority and created a notional Labour constituency: that notion became a reality early on election night last month, when Labour candidate Emma Foody won the seat easily and Levy, seeking re-election, finished in third place behind Reform UK.  Foody grew up in nearby Gosforth and worked as a 999 call handler for the North East Ambulance Service, but she then moved to Nottingham where she ran the Labour Party's East Midlands branch and was briefly deputy police and crime commissioner for Nottinghamshire.  She's one of the many first-time Labour MPs in the new House of Commons, but she might well have a head-start on finding her feet in Westminster because her husband Alex Norris is the Labour MP for Nottingham North and Kimberley.
</p><p>
Having secured every one of Northumberland's parliamentary seats in 2024, Labour's next target will surely be the county council at the next local elections in May 2025.  Northumberland council has been under Conservative minority control since 2017, which is partly due to mopping up what was left of the Lib Dem vote in the rural north but also owes a lot to gains in this corner of the county.  In 2013 the nine divisions in Cramlington and the Seaton Valley area to the east returned 7 Labour councillors and 2 Conservatives; the same area in 2021 elected 7 Conservative councillors, 1 Labour and 1 independent.  The Tories actually won a bare majority in the 2021 Northumberland council elections - 35 out of 69 seats - but this disappeared seven months later following a by-election loss to the Lib Dems in Hexham.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/northd21.png" alt="Northumberland, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Cramlington Eastfield was one of the seats which swung hard to the Conservatives over this period.  In 2013 the division voted 49% for Labour, 32% for the Liberal Democrats (who were historically the main opposition to Labour on the old Blyth Valley council), and just 19% for the Conservatives.  The winning Labour candidate in Cramlington Eastfield on this occasion was a young firebrand in her mid-twenties called Laura Pidcock, who went on to resoundingly lose her seat to the Conservatives in May 2017 on a massive swing before embarking on an equally ill-starred Parliamentary career as MP for North West Durham the following month.  The Conservative councillor who defeated Pidcock, Christine Dunbar, increased her majority in 2021 to 59-30 over Labour.
</p><p>
Christine Dunbar submitted her resignation in June, and the by-election to replace her has attracted a lot of interest with seven candidates being nominated.  The defending Conservative candidate Alan Smith is a retired NHS mental health support worker, who now spends his time on a variety of community projects.  Labour have selected James Gillooly, who is vice-chairman of the party's Cramlington and Killingworth branch; he is a student reading law at Newcastle University.  Two independent candidates are standing: Libby Cripps is a former assistant GP, while Dawn Furness is a former Green Party figure who was an independent candidate for Cramlington and Killingworth at the recent general election.  Completing the ballot are the official Green candidate Paul Evans, Andy McGregor of the Lib Dems and Mark Owen of Reform UK; Reform were in second place in this constituency last month, so it will be interesting to see how they do here.

<h2>Abbots Langley and Bedmond</h2>
</p><p>
Three Rivers council, Hertfordshire; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Matthew Bedford.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/three-rivers-abbots-langley-bedmond.png" alt="Three Rivers, Abbots Langley/Bedmond" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
We finish this week's column with a Lib Dem defence on the very edge of London's built-up area, in a ward which straddles the M25 motorway.  Inside the M25 we find Abbots Langley, which is now functionally a suburb of Watford but is still an independent parish council.  This is one of a few Langleys in the general area: the Abbots prefix indicates that Abbots Langley was granted in 1045 to the abbot of St Albans Abbey.  The smaller village of Bedmond lies around a mile to the north, outside the motorway.
</p><p>
This area has a long history which includes an unusually famous son.  The mediaeval chronicler Matthew Paris, writing from St Albans Abbey in the 13th century, places Bedmond as the birthplace of one Nicholas Breakspear in or around 1100.  Breakspear was from humble origins and he didn't stay long in England: he travelled to the south of France in his youth and made his career in the church.  He became an abbot in Avignon, then Bishop of Albano, and finally - in 1154 - Breakspear was elected as the first and (so far) only English pope, taking the name Adrian IV.  Adrian had a short and difficult reign of five years, in which he restored papal authority in the city of Rome, crowned the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, and was forced to sign a peace treaty with the Norman Kingdom of Sicily - which didn't go down well with Barbarossa, and resulted in a papal schism after Adrian's death in 1159.  Pope Adrian never forgot his Hertfordshire birthplace, and the late 1150s saw privilege after privilege being showered upon St Albans Abbey.
</p><p>
Your columnist has good memories of Abbots Langley.  Many years ago I attended a quiz there on the national circuit and managed to win the Civilisation section of the paper.  Unusually for the UK quiz circuit, there was a celebrity guest there to present my prize - Jeremy Beadle.  Beadle has gone down in the collective memory as a TV and radio prankster, but he was also a first-rate quizzer: he wrote quizzes for the <em>Independent</em> newspaper for many years, and in 1999 he took on the public as the professional quizzer in a Channel 5 game show called <em>Win Beadle's Money</em>.  A total of 52 episodes were made, with only eight contestants managing to actually defeat Jeremy Beadle and win his money.
</p><p>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkPotE7X84A
</p><p>
Curiously this isn't the only link between Abbots Langley and professional versus punter quiz shows: Bradley Walsh, the presenter of <em>The Chase</em>, once lived in Abbots Langley.  The village is also the birthplace of Liz Kendall, the Work and Pensions secretary, who grew up here.
</p><p>
Modern Abbots Langley very much has a middle-class demographic profile, which is helped by the fact that the ward boundaries include Kings Langley railway station from which there are regular commuter trains to Euston.  In last month's general election it was part of one of the relatively few number of London commuter seats to stick with the Conservative party: Abbots Langley and Bedmond are part of the South West Hertfordshire constituency, represented since 2019 by Conservative MP Gagan Mohindra who is now a junior frontbencher on the shadow education team.  This was a rare expansion of Conservative-held territory in the case of Bedmond, which was in the Lib Dem-held St Albans constituency until last month's parliamentary boundary changes.
</p><p>
In local government the Liberal Democrats dominate much of western Hertfordshire.  The local authority here is Three Rivers council, which has been under the leadership of the Lib Dems and their predecessors continuously since 1986 although not always with a majority.  In fact, the Lib Dem majority on the council will be down to one seat if they lose this by-election.
</p><p>
Abbots Langley's local government representation has been remarkably stable this century.  The current Abbots Langley and Bedmond ward, and the Abbots Langley ward which came before it, have had the same three councillors continuously since 1999: Sara and Matthew Bedford, and David Major, who were all elected as Liberal Democrats.  It's a safe Lib Dem ward under current conditions, and Matthew - who was first elected for the old Abbots Langley ward all the way back in 1994 - was re-elected in May 2024 for his tenth term of office with a 59-20 lead over the Conservatives.  Three Rivers council's May 2024 AGM elected Matthew Bedford as deputy leader of the council, with Sara also appointed to a cabinet position.
</p><p>
Two months later Matthew resigned as a Three Rivers councillor for personal reasons to support his wife, who is no longer in the cabinet or even in the Lib Dem group: she is now listed on the district council website as an independent councillor.  Curiously, Sara is still part of the Lib Dem group on Hertfordshire county council, where she represents Abbots Langley; Bedmond is part of the Three Rivers Rural county division, which is also Lib Dem-held.  Whatever falling-out there might have been would appear to be confined to the Three Rivers branch of the Lib Dems.
</p><p>
Defending this by-election for the Liberal Democrats is Alex Turner, who was previously a Three Rivers councillor for the neighbouring Leavesden ward from 2018 to 2022 before standing down after one term.  The Conservatives have selected Vicky Edwards, who has been a regular candidate in the neighbouring Gade Valley ward in recent years - but this is her home turf.  Also standing are Pierce Culliton for Labour and Jane Powell for the Green Party.
