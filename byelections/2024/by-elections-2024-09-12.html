<h2>Bridges</h2>

Gateshead council, Tyne and Wear; caused by the death of Labour councillor Bob Goldsworthy.

When taking the Metro south from North Jesmond, your train will dive into a tunnel just before Jesmond station on its way into Newcastle city centre.  Three more underground stations follow before the train suddenly emerges from the tunnel and crosses the deep and steep-sided valley of the Tyne on a long bridge.  This is one of the seven bridges over the Tyne which connect Newcastle city centre with Gateshead town centre, and six of them give their name to Bridges ward: in order they are the King Edward VII bridge (carrying the East Coast Main Line railway), the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge (carrying 	the Metro), the High Level Bridge (carrying mainline trains to and from Sunderland on the top deck, pedestrians and southbound buses on the lower deck), the Swing Bridge, the Tyne Bridge (through traffic) and the Millennium Bridge (foot traffic only).  The Millennium Bridge is a particulary striking design which won the 2022 Stirling Prize for architecture, and it appeared on £1 coins minted in 2007 (all of which have since been demonetised).  No longer here is the original Roman bridge of Pone Aelius, which was on the site now occupied by the Swing Bridge.

All of these bridges are to some extent iconic, but they come with a maintenance burden.  The High Level Bridge was opened in 1849 and is showing its age: the road deck has had a weight limit for many years, and road traffic on it is now restricted to buses and taxis in the southbound direction only.  The Swing Bridge, which dates from 1876 and was at the time the largest swing bridge ever built, has not in fact swung since 2019 due to technical difficulties.  And earlier this year a four-year programme of major restoration and repair work started on the Tyne Bridge, which is operating at half its capacity in consequence.  What all this work means for the colony of kittiwakes who have their nests on the Tyne Bridge remains to be seen.

Gateshead hasn't made quite as much of its riverside as its big brother over the river, which partly reflects the topography and partly reflects that quite a lot of the riverbank is still in industrial use.  Or is used for other purposes: much of the south bank of the Tyne between the Tyne and Millennium Bridges is occupied by the Navy as HMS <em>Calliope</em>, a training centre for the Royal Naval Reserve.  However, there is access to the riverbank at Baltic Square, next to the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art (opened in July 2002 in an old flour mill), the Glasshouse concert hall and conference centre (home to the Royal Northern Sinfonia, and formerly known for sponsorship reasons as the Sage Gateshead), and a brand-new indoor arena and conference centre which is currently under construction.

The south end of the Tyne and High Level Bridges runs more or less immediately into Gateshead town centre, which has been smartly regenerated in recent years: the brutalist <em>Get Carter</em> car park at Trinity Square is long gone, with much of its demolition rubble having been sold to film fans as memorabilia.  (The rooftop café seen in the film never actually opened, as it failed to secure either a tenant or a fire safety certificate.)  Most of Bridges ward's residents live to the south or the south-east of the town centre, as the land continues to rise steeply away from the Tyne.  Gateshead and Gateshead Stadium Metro stations serve the ward, although the stadium itself is just outside the ward boundary.

We should nonetheless have a word about the Gateshead International Stadium, which was originally built in 1955 and is the third-largest stadium in Tyne and Wear by capacity.  The stadium primarily caters for athletics and five world records have been set here, most recently in 2006 when Asafa Powell tied the record of 9.77 seconds for the 100 metres.  The non-league football side Gateshead FC also play at the International Stadium, and this led to problems a few months ago when Gateshead finished in sixth place in the National League's 2023-24 season and qualified for the playoffs.  Gateshead council, which owns the stadium, have refused to grant the football club the 10-year security of tenure which is a requirement for promotion to the EFL; as a result, Gateshead FC forfeited their place in the playoff quarter-finals.

Together with the neighbouring Saltwell ward to the south, Bridges ward is a centre of the only significant Orthodox Jewish community in north-east England.  Gateshead has been a Jewish centre since the nineteenth century, and its seminary - the Gateshead Yeshiva - was the largest centre of Jewish education left standing in Europe after the Holocaust.  In recent years the town's Jewish population has grown significantly thanks to relatively affordable housing, as Haredi families become priced out of their traditional areas in Manchester and London - more on that story later.  The 2021 census return had Bridges ward at 9.0% Jewish, about half the proportion in Saltwell ward.

Elections in Gateshead tend not be very exciting to watch.  The parliamentary seat of Gateshead Central and Whickham is safe for Labour and it was taken over this year by new Labour MP Mark Ferguson.  Before his election Ferguson was on the Labour Party NEC as a representative of the Unison trade union, and he has also worked as a journalist and as editor of the LabourList website.  He had a very comfortable lead in July over second-placed Reform UK.

In local elections Gateshead council is exceptionally boring.  The council has 47 Labour councillors plus this vacancy against an opposition of 18 Lib Dems, and those councillor figures haven't significantly changed for many years with few, if any, wards ever changing hands at any election.  Bridges ward has been safely in the Labour column since it was created in 2004, and the late Bob Goldsworthy had represented the ward since 2007; he passed away in June after a sudden illness, aged 67.  Goldsworthy had won his fifth and last term in 2023 with a 58-16 lead over the Conservatives, which is typical of results in Bridges ward this century; however, in May 2024 it appears that the Green Party had a go here, and the Labour lead was sharply cut to 49-33.

Still safe enough on paper, but this lead is not foolproof in by-election conditions as the defending Labour candidate Robert Waugh will be well aware.  He has the dubious distinction of being one of the few Gateshead Labour councillors to be unseated at the ballot box in recent years, having lost re-election to the Lib Dems in Saltwell ward last year.  In May Waugh contested the safe Lib Dem ward of Low Fell.  The Greens' Rachel Cabral, who has had a long career in the civil service, is back after her strong second place here in May; Cabral went on to be the Green candidate for Gateshead Central and Whickham in the general election in July, finishing in fifth place and saving her deposit.  Also standing are Paul Sterling for the Conservatives, Jonathan Aibi for the Lib Dems and David Ayre for Reform UK.

<h2>North Walsham Market Cross</h2>

North Norfolk council; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Richard Sims.

We stay in Norfolk for the next entry in our tour of East Anglia by travelling east to North Walsham, a market town which can be found around fifteen miles north of Norwich on the railway line to Cromer.  This was a very prosperous place in mediaeval times thanks to the textile industry, and we can see some of that wealth in the fourteenth-century bulk of the town's parish church.  Dedicated to St Nicholas, this is one of England's largest churches, although it's not as large as it used to be: the church tower collapsed in 1724 and has never been rebuilt.  Its ruined stump still dominates the town's skyline.

St Nicholas' church was consecreted in 1390 by Henry le Despenser, the bishop of Norwich, who a few years earlier had put down the last flickering embers of the Peasants' Revolt in the 1381 Battle of North Walsham: the local peasants' leader, Geoffrey Litster, was taken to North Walsham where he was hung, drawn and quartered.  This wasn't the end of the bishop's military career, as Despenser went on to lead the Norwich Crusade of 1383: this was an episode of the Hundred Years War in which the bishop led an army to Flanders and unsuccessfully laid siege to Ypres, in support of Pope Urban VI and against the supporters of the antipope Clement VII.  It was an adventure from which Bishop Despenser emerged with very little credit, but he still joined King Richard II on an invasion force to Scotland which sacked Edinburgh in 1385.

North Walsham's original market cross was lost in a 1600 fire which destroyed much of the town.  Shortly afterwards one of the local gentry, Sir William Paston (a descendant of the Pastons who wrote the fifteenth-century Paston Letters) founded the Paston Grammar School in the town.  Possibly the most famous Old Paston was Horatio Nelson, who attended the school until the age of 12; many years later, Paston Grammar School expelled a troublesome boy called Stephen Fry rather than let him take his A-levels.  Paston College (as it is now called following a number of mergers) still occupies much of North Walsham town centre.

Despite the presence of Paston College, Market Cross ward skews to the other end of the age range.  In the 2021 census the ward was in the top 20 wards in England and Wales for residents aged 85 or over (8.4%), and it was in the top 70 for adult residents who are retired (43.5%).

North Walsham elects five North Norfolk councillors from three wards: Market Cross covers the town centre, the railway station and the south of the town around North Walshsm High School.  North Norfolk council has been rather volatile in this century with some rather wild seat swings between the Conservatives and Lib Dems; in the 2023 council elections the Lib Dems held their majority but the Conservatives actually gained seats here, reflecting some recovery from a particularly dire result in 2019.  North Walsham town has returned a full slate of Lib Dem district councillors since at least 2003, and in the 2023 elections the Lib Dems' candidate Richard Sims, a former mayor of the town, held Market Cross ward by 50-38 - a swing to the Conservatives since 2019.  There was a further swing to the Conservatives in July at a by-election in the neighbouring North Walsham East ward, which was on the undercard of the general election.

Norfolk county council's electoral boundaries split North Walsham town between two divisions (North Walsham East, and North Walsham West and Erpingham) which both combine urban and rural areas; both of those divisions have been consistently Lib Dem since at least 2005 but were very close between the Lib Dems and Conservatives at the last county council elections in 2021.  The whole of the town is part of the North Norfolk parliamentary seat, which has been in Liberal Democrat hands since 2001 with the exception of 2019-24 term; in July the Conservative MP Duncan Baker was defeated by Lib Dem candidate Steffan Aquarone, who had previously been leader of the Lib Dem group on Norfolk county council.

Aquarone's successful parliamentary campaign came at the cost of losing the support of first-term Lib Dem councillor Richard Sims, who quit the party while the general election campaign was ongoing.  It appears that this was the result of a row in the local party's WhatApp group as to whether Reform UK should be considered racist; Sims took exception to that statement, and the discussion rapidly got out of control from there.  Having first left the Liberal Democrats, Richard Sims went on to quit the council altogether.

Defending this by-election for the Lib Dems is Mal Gray, a town councillor who runs a business on the town's market place.  Another North Walsham town councillor on the ballot is the Conservatives' Tracey Ginbey, who was their losing candidate in the East ward by-election two months ago; Ginbey works for an accounting firm in Cromer.  Also standing are Rebecca Shaw for Labour (who returns from the 2023 election) and Liz Dixon for the Green Party; there is nobody on the ballot from Reform UK.

<h2>Romsey</h2>

Cambridge council; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Mairéad Healy.

Our tour of East Anglia concludes in the city of Cambridge, where we travel to Romsey ward.  Romsey Town is eastern Cambridge to the north-east of the railway station, and much of its housing was originally built for railway workers in the late 19th century.  The ward is centred on the Romsey Recreation Groud and also includes the eastern end of the city's busy Mill Road; here can be found Brookfields Hospital and the adjacent Cambridge Central Mosque.  The latter is a striking new building opened in 2019, which has won several architectural awards and was unsuccesfully nominated for the 2021 Stirling Prize.  If the great Islamic architects of centuries past were working today, this is the sort of thing they would be doing now (although perhaps on a larger scale).

https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/Cmglee_Cambridge_Mosque_hall.jpg

In the 2021 census Romsey ward was in the top 30 wards in England and Wales for "professional" occupations (42.9% of the workforce), in the top 40 wards in England and Wales for residents born in the EU-14 countries (13.7%), and in the top 100 for residents working in education (19.1%) or the professional, scientific and technical sector (16.5%).  One historical offshoot of this is the Centre for Computing History, a collection of vintage computers and computer games which moved here from Haverhill in 2013.

Because of its railway past Romsey has always been a left-wing area: from the ward's creation in 1935 up until 1998 Romsey voted Labour in all city and county council elections except for a 1981 by-election, which went to the SDP.  The Lib Dems were competitive here for a time after 1998, but the formation of the Coalition took the floor ouf of their vote and Romsey is now safely back in the Labour columm.  In May 2024 Labour polled 52% of the vote here against 19% for the Greens and 11% for the Lib Dems; Labour also hold the larger Rosmey division of Cambridgeshire county council and together with the Cambridge parliamentary seat, where Daniel Zeichner was re-elected for a fourth term of office in July without fuss.  Zeichner is now a junior minister at DEFRA, with responsibility for food security and rural affairs.

Cambridge city council has a Labour majority, with the latest composition giving 25 Labour seats, 10 Lib Dems, 5 Greens, 1 Conservative and this vacancy.  The outgoing councillor Mairéad Healy was first elected here in 2021 and re-elected for a second term in May 2023.  In October 2023 she quit the Labour party over its Gaza policy, and she became an independent councillor.

Healy has now tendered her resignation from Cambridge city council, giving the Labour party the chance to reverse that defection loss.  Their defending candidate is Beth Gardiner-Smith, who until recently ran a charity supporting refugees; she contested Queen Edith's ward in May's city council elections.  The Greens have selected Zak Karimjee, who is a mechanical engineering professional; he stood in Petersfield ward in May.  Back for another go is the ward's regular Lib Dem candidate John Walmsley, who works in the field of electron microscopy.  The Conseravtives' Rob Nelson completes the ballot paper.

<h2>London Fields; and<br>
Stoke Newington</h2>

Hackney council, London; caused respectively by the resignations of Labour councillor Lee Laudat-Scott and Mete Coban.

It's been a vintage twelve months for conoisseurs of Hackney council by-elections.  Last November the entire borough went to the polls to elect a new mayor; while so far this year this column has covered council by-elections in Cazenove, De Beauvoir, Hoxton East and Shoreditch, Hoxton West, and Cazenove again.  Now it's time for the sixth and seventh Hackney council by-elections of 2024, and there's still two and half months of the year to go if any more of the borough's councillors fancy giving me something to write about.

Our two Hackney by-elections today fall at opposite ends of the borough.  Stoke Newington is one of the old Metropolitan Boroughs which fused together to make the modern Hackney borough in the 1960s, and still has some of its own neighbourhood character around Stoke Newington Church Street.  The modern ward of that name covers the eastern end of that street together with the whole of Stoke Newington High Street: this is part of the A10 road, and its arrow-straight nature indicates that it lies on the line of the Roman Ermine Street.

Much of the north of this ward is covered by Abney Park, which is named after Mary Abney whose husband, Sir Thomas Abney, was Lord Mayor of London in 1700-01.  Lady Abney inherited the manor of Stoke Newington in 1701 from her brother and turned much of the area into a park.  There is a statue here to the nonconformist minister Isaac Watts, who lived for most of his life in Lady Abney's household.  Watts wrote extensively on logic and chemistry, but he is best remembered today as a hymnwriter; many of his hymns have stood the test of time, including the Christmas carol <em>Joy to the World</em> and the Easter humn <em>When I Survey the Wondrous Cross</em>.

Stoke Newington was a centre of nonconformism for a very long time, and when Abney Park was turned into a cemetery in the 1840s it quickly became the most fashionable resting place for Victorian nonconformists.  Although the cemetery company was run by Congregationalists, the park was never consecrated ground and burials there were open to anyone.  The Salvation Army founders William and Catherine Booth are buried here, together with many people who were involved in the anti-slavery movement of the early 19th century which was particularly strong in Stoke Newington.  Abney Park Cemetery has a unique status as both a cemetery and a public park at the same time; in recent years burials here have more or less dried up and the park aspect is seen as more important by Hackney Council, who now run the place.  Nonetheless there are 200,000 people lying here in eternal rest, so the council had better have a plan for when the zombie apocalypse arrives.

A couple of miles down the A10 and a few stops south on the Overground from Stoke Newington brings us to another open space - although this time definitely not a cemetery.  London Fields, just to the south of Hackney town centre, is an area of ancient pastureland which goes back to the 13th century; historically, it was comman land used as the last overnight stop for grazing animals on their way to Smithield Market.  It is served by two London Overground railway stations, London Fields on the West Anglia lines and Haggerston on the East London Line.  Your columnist has been here a few times - the Quiz League of London hosts an annual buzzer quiz at the Urswick School, just off the ward's north-east corner - and I've always found London Fields to be a nice place to visit on a warm summer evening.  The E5 Bakehouse, located in a railway arch underneath London Fields station, comes recommended.

It says a lot for how Hackney is gentrifying that both London Fields and Stoke Newington wards come in the top 50 wards in England and Wales for "associate professional and technical occupations".  London Fields is at number 7 for those working in the arts, enterainment and recreation sector (7.6%) and in the top 40 for professional, scientific and technical activities (18.4%); it also comes in the top 100 for households with no access to a car.  London Fields comes in at number 4 for residents born in British territories overseas (0.5%) and in the top 20 for those born in Oceania (2.7%); Stoke Newington is also in top 40 for both those categories.  London Fields also makes the top 100 wards in England and Wales for those born in European countries outside the EU (5.4%) and for the 30-44 age bracket (29.9%).

Both of there wards vote safely Labour at all levels of government.  Stoke Newington was a constituency of its own from 1918 until it was combined with Hackney North in 1950, and the Hackney North and Stoke Newington constituency has had only three MPs in its 74-year history: David Weitzman (first elected for Stoke Newington in 1945) retired in 1979 as the oldest member of the Commons and the last MP to be born in the 19th century, Ernie Roberts then had an eight-year tenure before handing the seat over in 1987 to Diane Abbott, the first black woman elected to Parliament.  Abbott has had some well-publicised difficulties with the Labour Party in recent years, but she is now back in the fold and was re-elected in July for her tenth term of office to become Mother of the House.

London Fields ward is part of the Hackney South and Shoreditch constituency, which has been represented since 2005 by Dame Meg Hillier; Hillier previously represented Hackney on the London Assembly, as the representative for its North East constituency from 2000 to 2004.  Dame Meg has chaired the Commons Public Accounts Committee in the last three Parliaments, but this is a job reserved for an opposition backbencher so Hillier needed to find a different role going foward.  At the time of writing, she was understood to be standing for chair of the Treasury select committee.

The Hackney elected mayoralty has been in Labour hands since its creation in 2002, and Labour also enjoy a large majority on Hackney council.  London Fields and Stoke Newington wards are both part of that majority; in the 2022 council elections Labour led 61-26 in London Fields and 52-30 in Stoke Newington, with the Green Party in second place in both wards.

Unfortunately, the London Fields by-election may be one from the Councillors Behaving Badly file.  It is to replace Labour's Lee Laudat-Scott, who was in his first term and was serving as the council's deputy speaker; he also sat on the council's children and young people's scrutiny commission.  Laudat-Scott quit the council in July, and a few days later he appeared before Thames magistrates charged with sexual assault of a man and with intentionally touching a boy aged under 13.  He is the second Hackney Labour councillor of this term to be forced out over a paedophile scandal.

There is nothing untoward surrounding the vacancy in Stoke Newington, where the by-election is to replace long-serving Labour councillor Mete Coban.  Coban was first elected for this ward in 2014 at the age of 21, having founded a charity to help young people get involved in our democracy: he was appointed MBE in the 2020 New Year Honours for services to young people.  Mete Coban has now gone to work for Sadiq Khan as the Deputy Mayor of London for Environment and Energy, which is a politically restricted post; as such, he had to resign his Hackney council seat on taking up the role.

In Stoke Newington the defending Labour candidate is Zak Davies-Khan, who is on the staff of a Labour MP; he describes himself on his social media as "proudly Welsh and a member of the African Diaspora".  The Green candidate Liam Davis comes here hotfoot from the Hackney council by-election in Hoxton East and Shoreditch ward last May; he currently works for an NGO advocating for greater transparency and standards in the fashion supply chain.  Also standing here are Thrusie Maurseth-Cahill for the Lib Dems, Tareke Gregg for the Conservatives and independent candidate Tan Bui, who gives an address in Lewisham; he contested a Lewisham council by-election last May.

The Labour defence of London Fields is led by George Gooch, who works in the renewable energy sector.  Interestingly he is not facing Green opposition here; the Greens have instead endorsed left-wing and pro-Gaza independent candidate Sarah Byrne, who is a teacher and NEU officer.  Completing the London Fields ballot paper are Peter Friend for the Liberal Democrats, Diana Mikolajewska for the Conservatives and Olivia Taylor for the Workers Party.

<h2>Bow East</h2>

Tower Hamlets council, London; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Rachel Blake.

Our final poll today is also in East London, on the west bank of the River Lea which was once the boundary between Middlesex and Essex.  In ancient times the river could be forded at approximately its tidal limit, and there was a small settlement here at Old Ford.  This was the ford which gave its name to Stratford on the far side of the river; the "Strat" of that name refers to the Roman Road from Londinium to Camulodunum.

Things changed in 1110 when Henry I's wife Queen Matilda was travelling along this road and she fell into the river.  To avoid a repeat of this, she ordered a bridge to be erected over the Lea in stone.  This bridge ended up with a rather striking design of three bow-shaped arches, and it ended up giving its name to the area of Stratford-atte-Bow - eventually shortened to just Bow, as the name Stratford came to be associated with the Essex side of the river.

For centuries Bow Bridge was the lowest crossing-point of the Lea and the main communication link between London and Essex.  The Essex contingent of the Peasants' Revolt crossed the bridge here in 1381, and its strategic importance was illustrated in 1648 with the Battle of Bow Bridge: a rare victory for the Royalists in the late stages of the English Civil War.  This mediaeval bridge has now been replaced with a modern four-lane structure plus a two-lane flyover above that: this is part of the Bow Interchange, a three-level grade-separated junction between the east-west A11 Bow Road and the north-south A12 Blackwall Tunnel Approach Road.  Bow Road separates immediately to the west of this interchange to pass either side of the mediaeval Bow Church, which still occupies an island in the middle of the road.  The Blackwall Tunnel Approach Road would have formed part of the London Ringway network of high-speed roads that was mostly never built, and the section of it from Old Ford northwards to Hackney Wick was until 2000 classified as a motorway with the number A102(M).

Outside Bow Church is a statue of W E Gladstone, erected in 1882 and paid for by local businessman William Bryant.  He was the Bryant in the safety match manufacturers Bryant and May, whose main matchmaking factory was located just to the north of the church and provided thousands of jobs for the area.  Not to modern standards of health and safety, it has to be said: the active ingredient in safety matches at the time was white phosphorous (also konwn as yellow phosphorous) meaning that phossy jaw was an occupational hazard, and the Bryant and May factory's working conditions and industrial practices were so poor that they provoked the celebrated "matchgirls' strike" of 1888.

The Bryant and May match factory is no longer in operation today, but many of its buildings survive and have been converted into flats.  One of those flats, occupied by the comedian Danny Wallace, was declared to be its own micronation - the "Kingdom of Lovely" - as part of a 2005 BBC2 series called <em>How to Start Your Own Country</em>.  It's fair to say that the Kingdom of Lovely has not stood the test of time.

Most of Bow East ward lies to the north of the old factory site in the area now known as Old Ford, which runs up to the Hertford Union Canal.  Beyond the canal to the north is the eastern half of Victoria Park, while to the east - on the far side of the Blackwall Tunnal Approach Road - we find the rapidly-gentrifying Fish Island, which has changed a lot from the days when Channel 4's <em>The Big Breakfast</em> was broadcast from here in the 1990s.  We can see this new development clearly in Bow East ward's census return, with the ward making the top 100 in England and Wales for households in shared ownership (4.7%), adults in associate professional or technical occuaptions (20.7%), households with no access to a car (65.1%), British Overseas nationals (0.3%) and the 30-44 age group (34.5%).

One driver for this regeneration was the 2012 London Olympics.  The former <em>Big Breakfast</em> Lock Keeper's Cottage is now almost in the shadow of the London Stadium across the River Lea; while next to the cottage is a primary school named after Bobby Moore, whose former club West Ham United now call the London Stadium home.  Although the stadium is part of Newham borough, the Bobby Moore Academy is on the Middlesex side of the river and thus is not actually part of West Ham.

The River Lea here is a former county boundary and still a London Borough boundary, but it's no longer a parliamentary boundary.  The recent constituency boundary changes gave two new seats to Greater London, and one of them is Straford and Bow: Stratford had previously been part of the seriously oversized West Ham constituency, while Bow was formerly linked with Bethnal Green for parliamentary purposes.  The new seat has a first-term Labour MP, although Uma Kumaran has nonetheless already made something of a career out of politics: her previous roles include working an an adviser to both Sadiq Khan and Sir Keir Starmer.

The 21st Century Rotten Borough of Tower Hamlets is politically a very different matter.  This is in the hands of elected mayor Lutfur Rahman and his Aspire party, which draws much of its support from Tower Hamlets' Bangladeshi community.  This community is not a major feature of Bow East ward's census return, which perhaps explains why Aspire haven't even bothered to stand in this by-election, and as such Bow East has been spared some of the more deplorable practices which led to Mayor Rahman being disqualified from office for five years for electoral fraud at the 2014 Tower Hamlets elections.  Andy Erlam, who brought the Election Court case that led to Rahman's disqualification, was a candidate for this ward in the 2014 election: he stood on the ticket of his own Red Flag Anti-Corruption party, and finished last. In recent years Bow East ward has safely returned the Labour slate to Tower Hamlets council: shares of the vote here in 2022 were 47% for Labour, 22% for Aspire and 16% for the Greens, who represnet the Stratford Olympic Park ward of Newham on the far side of the Lea.

Since Bow East ward's current boundaries were introduced in 2014 the ward has had the same three councillors: Rachel Blake, her partner Marc Francis and Amina Ali, who are all Labour councillors.  Blake has topped the poll on each occasion.  She was a deputy mayor of Tower Hamlets when Labour were running the borough from 2018 to 2022, and she has now made the step up to Westminster in every sense as the first-ever Labour MP for the Cities of London and Westminster.  This was no mean feat: that seat had elected Conservative MPs since its creation in 1950, with the sole exception of the 1964 election which happened while the Two Cities' MP Sir Harry Hylton-Foster was Speaker of the Commons.

Rachel Blake has stood down from Tower Hamlets council, and the Labour candidate in the by-election to replace her is Abdi Mohamed: he works as a policy officer for the disability charity Scope.  As stated there is no candidate for the Aspire group which runs the council, so Labour's main opposition may well come from the Green Party's Rupert George: he is the national communications manager for the Green Party of England and Wales, and he coordinated the party's manifesto at the recent general election.  Also standing are Siobhan Proudfoot for the Lib Dems and Robin Edwards for the Conservatives.
