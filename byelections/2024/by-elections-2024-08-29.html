<!-- Andrew's previews continue to be historical and electoral tours de force. - Lord Hayward -->
<blockquote>
"All the right votes, but not necessarily in the right order"
</blockquote>
</p><p>
Three by-elections on 29th August 2024:
</p><p>
<h2>Badsey and Aldington; and<br>
Harvington and Norton</h2>
</p><p>
Wychavon council, Worcestershire; caused respectively by the resignations of Conservative councillors Philippa Capel and Bradley Thomas.
</p><p>
Andrew's Previews has a busy time ahead over the next few weeks as a direct knock-on effect of last month's general election.  Your columnist's list of future by-elections has 72 vacancies on it at the time of writing, of which 22 are caused by newly-elected MPs resigning their previous council seats.  This is by no means an exhaustive list: in England and Scotland there is no legal problem with MPs serving as councillors at the same time, and there will be many more newly-elected MPs who are waiting for the next scheduled election in their ward, or for their term to expire, before standing down from the council.
</p><p>
Of those 22 upcoming by-elections, 20 are to replace Labour MPs (with six of those scheduled for next week) and one is a Scottish National Party defence.  But today's entry in this series is from the Conservatives, who of course suffered massive losses in the 2024 general election but are still welcoming 26 rookie MPs to their group.  The first of those to take the oath of allegiance was Bradley Thomas, who took over the Bromsgrove constituency in Worcestershire from the retiring Sajid Javid.  Thomas was also first out of the blocks in the race to resign his council seat.

</p><p>
Before his selection as the Conservatives' prospective candidate for Bromsgrove, Thomas had been the leader of Wychavon council which covers a large swathe of eastern Worcestershire.  The council is based in Pershore but its largest town is Evesham, and the two Wychavon council elections today are in wards bordering Evesham.  To the north of that town we find Thomas' old ward of Harvington and Norton, which lies on the western side of the Avon valley; while Badsey and Aldington ward lies to the east of Evesham on the other side of the river.  The name of Badsey refers to an island associated with an Anglo-Saxon called BÃ¦ddi, and in the massive Evesham floods of 2007 Badsey briefly became an island again.

</p><p>
The Vale of Evesham is a very Tory area of the country, and Wychavon council remains safely under Conservative control with both of these wards safely part of the Tory majority.  At the last local elections in 2023 Badsey and Aldington ward was a straight fight between the Conservatives and Labour with Philippa Capel, a pyschologist, prevailing by 56-44.  She has stood down after just over a year in office.  Harvington and Norton is an area where it can be difficult to find non-Conservative candidates to stand, and Bradley Thomas was elected unopposed here in 2019 after transferring from Broadway and Wickhamford ward which he had represented since 2015.  Thomas did face a contest in 2023, winning Harvington and Norton ward by 54-31 over the Lib Dems.
</p><p>
These wards are both part of safely Conservative divisions of Worcestershire county council (Harvington and Littletons respectively), and Badsey and Aldington still has a Conservative MP.  Nigel Huddleston, who lives in Badsey, has represented Droitwich and Evesham (and its predecessor seat of Mid Worcestershire) since 2015; he spent much of the last Parliament as a junior minister, and he is currently on the opposition frontbench shadowing his previous role as financial secretary to the Treasury.  The boundary changes for the last general election transferred Harvington and Norton ward into the Redditch constituency, which was a narrow Labour gain last month: new Labour MP Chris Bloore won Redditch with a majority of just 789 votes.
</p><p>
Both of these by-elections have a field of four candidates.  In Harvington and Norton the defending Conservative candidate is Steve Mackay, who is currently Worcestershire county council's cabinet member for children and families; Mackay lives in Pershore but he represents the highly-marginal St Peter division in Worcester on the county council, and one suspects he's looking for somewhere politically safer.  The Lib Dems' Pete Johnson is back for another go after his second-place finish last time.  Completing the Harvington and Norton ballot paper are Alan Humphries for the Green Party and independent candidate Craig Reeves, who has gone big on social media in his campaign.  There was another independent who put nomination papers in, but she has withdrawn and she will not be on the ballot.
</p><p>
In Badsey and Aldington the defending Conservative candidate is Mark Ward, who is seeking to make a political comeback after losing his Wychavon council seat to the Lib Dems in Drakes Broughton, Norton and Whittington ward last year.  (This is a different Norton to the Norton in Harvington and Norton ward.)  Last year's losing Labour candidate Mary Campbell is back for another go; she is a Badsey and Aldington parish councillor and she has previously chaired that council for seven years.  Also standing here are Matthew Jones for the Lib Dems and independent candidate Rob Robinson, who runs a coffee house in Evesham.

<h2>Bedwell</h2>
</p><p>
Hertfordshire county council; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Baroness Taylor of Stevenage.
</p><p>
Our other council by-election today is also triggered by the Labour win in last month's general election; however, in this case the retiring councillor is not a newly-elected MP.  Instead we say goodbye from local government to a peer: Sharon Taylor, who had been a long-serving and high-profile councillor in the New Town of Stevenage.  Taylor was leader of Stevenage council from 2006 to 2022, and she had been appointed OBE in the 2013 New Year honours for services to local government; in 2022 she was promoted to the Labour group in the House of Lords, taking the title Baroness Taylor of Stevenage.  Taylor has now joined the ranks of government on the team at the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, where she is the UK Government's Lords spokesperson on the subjects of - what else? - housing and local government.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/herts-cc-bedwell.png" alt="Herts CC, Bedwell" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Baroness Taylor had already stood down from Stevenage council at the May 2024 elections, but she still had nearly a year left on her term as the Hertfordshire county councillor for Bedwell which she had represented since winning a by-election in March 2008.  The Bedwell county division is the centre of Stevenage's built-up area, taking in the residential areas of Bedwell to the east of the town centre and Pin Green to the north of Bedwell.  All of this is New Town development from the 1950s and 1960s, and the county division still has large proportions of social housing.
</p><p>
In a 2023 Labour Together report, "Stevenage woman" - a stereotypical suburban mother in her early 40s - became one of those tiresome political labels which are coined from time to time to describe demographics which are apparently crucial to winning the next general election.  There has been a Stevenage parliamentary seat since 1983 and it is a bellwether, having voted for the government at all eleven general elections since then; that means Stevenage was a Labour gain in July with a convincing majority of 6,618 votes, and the town has a new MP to match.  Kevin Bonavia was born in Malta and has lived in England since the age of 8; he has previously served three terms on Lewisham council while pursuing a pre-Parliamentary career in the law.
</p><p>
The Stevenage constituency has always included some rural and commuter territory from outside the town - notably Knebworth - and this enabled the Conservatives to win the seat in 2010, 2015 and 2017 when Sharon Taylor was the defeated Labour candidate.  Stevenage council is much more left-wing than the constituency as a whole and it has had an impregnable Labour majority since the 1974 reorganisation.  So it says something for how well the Conservatives did in the 2021 Hertfordshire county elections that the borough of Stevenage returned four Conservative county councillors, one Lib Dem and just one Labour: that was Taylor in Bedwell division, where she had a 48-35 lead over the Conservatives.  The ward and county division boundaries don't match up, but in May Labour will have comfortably carried this area.  Labour are in a poor third on the county council, which has a Conservative majority with the Lib Dems in second; but the vote shares here should be watched closely, as Hertfordshire could be a difficult defence for the Conservatives in May 2025.

</p><p>
Defending this by-election for Labour is Ellie Plater, who has represented the smaller Bedwell ward on Stevenage council since 2023 and now has the chance to double up at borough and county level.  The Conservative candidate is Harry Curtis, who chairs the town's Young Conservatives branch; in May's borough elections he contested Old Town ward, which is not part of this division.  Also standing are Riad Mannan for the Lib Dems, Balgiisa Ahmed for the Greens and Janet Bainbridge for Reform UK.
