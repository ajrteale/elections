One by-election on Tuesday 16th April 2024:
</p><p>
<h2>St Ishmael's</h2>
</p><p>
Pembrokeshire council; caused by the death of independent councillor Reg Owens.
</p><p>
"Call me Ishmael" is one of the great opening lines of English-langauge literature, being the first three words of Herman Melville's classic 1851 novel <em>Moby-Dick</em>.  This was, of course, the story of Captain Ahab, who went half-mad in his quest for vengeance on a white whale, the Moby-Dick of the title, who had bitten off Ahab's leg on an earlier voyage.
</p><p>

</p><p>
Madness upon the seas is not confined to Captain Ahab, of course, and there are a few stories to tell relating to St Ishmael's ward.  This covers a remote corner of Pembrokeshire.  The village of St Ishmaels lies close to the north bank of the Cleddau estuary: it is named not after the biblical Ishmael but after a 6th-century Welsh bishop, Isfael or Ismael.  St Ismael was the bishop of Rhos, an old <em>cantref</em> of Wales which covered this area and eventually turned into the Roose Hundred of Pembrokeshire.  Back in the day, Ismael's see is thought to have been at modern-day St Ishmael's.
</p><p>
The modern-day St Ishmael's ward takes in five other communities in the area and essentially covers the countryside to the west and north of the town of Milford Haven.  Much of this area is within the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park, but that's not necessarily a guarantee of nice countryside.  Milford Haven is located on one of the deepest natural harbours in the world, which makes it particularly well-suited to handling the petrochemicals industry's very largest oil and gas tankers: accordingly the 20th century saw the development of a number of oil refineries in the town, some of which are located in St Ishmael's ward.  In the 21st century the South Hook oil refinery was redeveloped as a liquified natural gas terminal, handling its first vessel in 2009; a quarter of the UK's gas supply now comes through Milford Haven as LNG, either via South Hook or via the smaller Dragon LNG terminal to the east of the town.  South Hook is partly within St Ishmael's ward; not only that, it's also partly within the Pembrokeshire National Park boundary.
</p><p>
All this has not been without consequence for the local wildlife.  The very first oil tanker to unload at Milford Haven, <em>Esso Portsmouth</em> in 1960, created a serious oil spill.  Other mishaps include the wreck of the <em>Sea Empress</em> in 1996, with the resulting major spill taking five years to fully clean up.
</p><p>
The <em>Sea Empress</em> disaster had a major effect on the local birdlife, and there are an awful lot of birds in St Ishmael's ward because the boundaries include a number of islands in the Atlantic.  Closest to the mainland is Skomer, which is home to a large colony of Atlantic puffins - or <em>Fratercular arctica</em>, to give that species its scientific name.  <em>Puffinus puffinus</em> is, as many quizzers know, the scientific name not for the puffin but for the Manx shearwater - and half of the world's population of Manx shearwater birds live on Skomer.  The nearby island of Skokholm has another 15% of the world's Manx shearwater together with a large storm petrel population.
</p><p>
Further out in the Atlantic is the tiny island of Grassholm, which is owned by the RSPB and is home to 10% of the world's northern gannets.  Grassholm is not quite the westernmost point of Wales, with that title going to the barren rocks on which Smalls Lighthouse stands 21 miles to the west of the Pembrokeshire coast.
</p><p>
Which brings us back to the theme of madness upon the seas, as we recall a nasty story from 1801 when the lighthouse keepers on duty at Smalls were Thomas Howell and Thomas Griffith.  They were known to be on poor terms, so when Griffith fell ill and eventually died Howell was justifiably worried that he might be accused of murder.  Forced to keep Griffiths' decomposing body as evidence for the authorities, Howell built a makeshift coffin and tied it to a shelf on the outside of the lighthouse; but the box didn't stand up to the Atlantic winds, and Griffith's arm ended up hanging over the edge of the shelf, from where it could be seen from inside being blown by the wind in a beckoning manner.  When Howell was eventually relieved after three weeks or more of this trauma, he was a broken man: most accounts of the story say that he had been driven mad, and his physical appearance had changed so drastically that his friends didn't recognise him.  Trinity House was forced to act to prevent something like that happening again, and they immediately increased the standard size of lighthouse crews from two to three men.
</p><p>
Today there are no men keeping the light lit on Smalls Lighthouse: it's run remotely from Trinity House's control room in Harwich.  Grassholm, Skomer and Skokholm have no permanent residents, although Skomer has regular ferries to the mainland and a hostel is available on that island for overnight stays.  The Welsh Government has not yet legislated to give the vote to Manx shearwater, puffins, gannets or any of the other birds which call these islands home.  So this election will be decided by the human population of St Ishmael's ward, which makes the top 50 wards in England and Wales for self-employment - a statistic whose highest scores are normally seen in remote rural areas, particularly in rural Wales.
</p><p>
St Ishmael's ward is part of the Preseli Pembrokeshire constituency in the Senedd, which has been represented in Cardiff Bay since 2007 by the Conservatives' Paul Davies.  He was leader of the Welsh Conservatives from 2018 to 2021, when he resigned shortly before the 2021 Senedd election after being seen drinking alcohol on Welsh Parliament premises - at a time when Welsh COVID-19 regulations banned pubs from serving alcoholic drinks.
</p><p>
The forthcoming Westminster boundary changes create a new constituency of Mid and South Pembrokeshire, which will soon be defended for the Conservatives by Stephen Crabb.  Crabb was first elected for Preseli Pembrokeshire in 2005: he served in Cabinet during the Cameron years, with two years as Welsh secretary followed by a few months at the DWP, and he was elected in 2020 as chair of the Welsh Affairs select committee.
</p><p>
Both Preseli Pembrokeshire and Mid and South Pembrokeshire are Conservative versus Labour fights, but Welsh local elections are a different matter, particularly so in Pembrokeshire.  St Ishmael's ward lies south of the Landsker line and it is a part of the Little England Beyond Wales, where the Welsh language is little used and consequently there is not much support for Welsh speakers' main political champion, Plaid Cymru.  Pembrokeshire is one of two Welsh councils with a majority of independent councillors (the other being Merthyr Tydfil), and St Ishmael's ward is part of that majority.
</p><p>
The outgoing councillor Reg Owens, who died in February at the age of 77 after some years of poor health, had spent 45 years working for the local authority before being elected to the council as an independent member for St Ishmael's ward in 2012.  He had also served several terms as chair of Herbrandston community council within the ward, and spent five years as chair of the Pembrokeshire National Park Authority's planning committee.  Owens was a wheelchair user, and equal opportunities was one of his political passions.
</p><p>
Reg Owens' final re-election in 2022 was with a rather low vote share of 35%, with his main competition coming from other independent candidates: Martyn Cheshire polled 28%, with Claire George coming in third on 25%.  The only recognised party to stand a candidate here last time was the Greens.
</p><p>
We might see a similarly fractured result in this by-election with four independent candidates contesting St Ishmael's.  Taking them in ballot paper order, Janie Harwood stood here this ward in 2022 for the Green Party, coming fourth and last with 11%; Richard Jenkins is the chairman of St Ishmaels Sports Club and vice-chairman of that village's carnival committee; Bob Simister is a Haverfordwest town councillor; and Terry Worsley appears to be fighting his first election campaign.  Again, there is only one political party candidate: Claire George, who finished third here in 2022 as an independent, is back for another go and this time she has the Conservative nomination.
