<h2>Drumchapel/Anniesland;<br>
Maryhill; and<br>
North East</h2>

Glasgow council, Scotland; caused respectively by the resignations of Labour councillors Patricia Ferguson, Keiran O'Neill and Maureen Burke.

We now come to the first three of our Labour defences today, which are all for seats on Glasgow city council.  Two of the city's Labour MPs, Maureen Burke and Patricia Ferguson, were elected in July as the new Labour MPs for Glasgow North East and Glasgow West respectively; both Burke and Ferguson turn 66 this year, making them among the oldest members of the new Labour intake.  Our third poll today is to place Keiran O'Neill, who stood down in September due to changes in his personal and professional life.

Of the three outgoing councillors, Patricia Ferguson has the longest political history.  She served in the Scottish Parliament from 1999 to 2016, as Labour MSP for Glasgow Maryhill and then (after boundary changes) for Glasgow Maryhill and Springburn.  Ferguson became the first Deputy Presiding Officer of the revived Parliament in 1999, before joining the Labour frontbench in 2001; five and a half years in the Scottish Executive saw her hold first the Parliamentary business then the tourism portfolio.

After losing her Scottish Parliament seat in 2016, Ferguson was elected in 2022 as a Labour councillor for Drumchapel/Anniesland ward in the north-west corner of Glasgow.  This ward is neatly divided into two halves by the Forth and Clyde Canal and generally lies north of the Great Western Road.  Anniesland lies nearer the city centre, and it includes Scotland's tallest Grade A listed building: the 22-storey Anniesland Court tower block, completed in 1968.  Drumchapel, the city's north-west corner, boomed in population in the 1950s with the building of a massive housing estate for Glasgow overspill - a young Billy Connolly was one of the thousands of people rehoused here.  The course of the Antonine Wall - once the northern limit of the Roman empire - cuts through an undeveloped corner of the ward.

Drumchapel/Anniesland was left almost untouched by ward boundary changes in 2017.  At its first election in 2007 it returned three Labour councillors including the council leader Steven Purcell, and Bill Kidd for the SNP.  On the same day Kidd was elected to Holyrood as a regional MSP for Glasgow, and he stood down from the council in 2009 prompting a by-election which was won by Labour's Anne McTaggart.  She stood down in 2012 having herself been elected to Holyrood the previous year, and the SNP got their seat back.  In 2017 and 2022 Drumchapel/Anniesland returned two Labour and two SNP councillors, although there was some churn in between: McTaggart, having returned to the council in 2017, defected to the SNP and was re-elected under her new colours while outgoing SNP councillor Elspeth Kerr sought re-election as an independent and was defeated.  Starting shares of the vote here in 2022 were 38% each for Labour and the SNP against 10% for the Conservatives; rerunning the count for one seat gives an equally close final result of 3,256 for Labour's Paul Carey against a total of 3,235 for the top two SNP candidates.

Kieran O'Neill has vacated his seat in Maryhill ward.  The eponymous Mary Hill was an eighteenth-century figure who inherited some land in an area north of Glasgow, then known as Gairbraid, when her father died with no male heirs.  The family's fortunes perked up when the Forth and Clyde Canal was driven through the Gairbraid estate, leading first to large compensation payments and then to the development of a canalside village: Mary and her husband saw an opportunity, and they granted further land for development on condition that it would be "in all times called the town of Mary Hill".  The town thrived, and it was an independent burgh for a time in the nineteenth century before eventually being absorbed into Glasgow: the Burgh Halls still exist and are well-used by the local community.  Later developments in Maryhill include the large Summerston housing estate on the northern edge of teh city, and the West of Scotland Science Park along the road towards Bearsden.  For some reason Maryhill has attracted the attention of TV over the years, with <em>Taggart</em> being set in the area and much of <em>Chewin' the Fat</em> and <em>Still Game</em> having been filmed here.

The present Maryhill ward was created in 2017 as a cut-down version of the former Maryhill/Kelvin ward, and it returns three Glasgow councillors.  In both 2017 and 2022 those three seats split two to the SNP and one to Labour, with first preference shares in 2022 being 42% for the SNP, 34% for Labour and 12% for the Green Party.  The two-party preferred vote between the SNP and Labour comes out at 52-48 in the SNP's favour, so this is definitely a marginal ward to watch.  Kieran O'Neill had served the ward since 2022.

Maureen Burke has made the step up to the Glasgow North East constituency from the rather smaller North East ward of Glasgow.  This ward lies entirely north of the M8 motorway and it is based on Easterhouse, one of the most notorious and least successful of Glasgow's postwar housing developments: Easternhouse's population has halved since the 1960s.  The ward also includes the fifteenth-century manor house of Provan Hall, the Hogganfield and Provanmill areas closer to the city centre and one of the few genuine villages within the Glasgow city boundary, Gartloch.  Robroyston railway station, opened in 2019, lies on the ward boundary.

North East ward was cut down in size and lost a councillor in the 2017 Glasgow boundary changes, becoming a closely-fought three-seat ward.  In 2022 Labour gained a seat from the SNP here, to leave the seat count at 2-1 in Labour's favour based on a first preference lead of 44-43.  Labour's Maureen Burke had served the ward since 2012 and topped the poll in each of her three elections; she would have won a single-seat contest here by 53-47 over the SNP after transfers.

Maureen Burke and Patricia Ferguson both represent their former wards in Parliament, respectively as part of the Glasgow North East and Glasgow West cosntituencies.  In the previous Parliament Drumchapel/Anniesland was part of the Glasgow North West seat, which disappeared in this year's boundary changes as Glasgow lost an MP overall.  The SNP, who held all of Glasgow's parliamentary seats at the time, manoeuvred to ensure that the outgoing MP who didn't get reselected was Patrick Grady whose Glasgow North seat then, as now, included Maryhill.  Grady's seat had survived the boundary changes relatively unscathed, but he had spent a period without the SNP whip in 2022 for breaches of Westminster's sexual misconduct policy and he was clearly seen by the party as damaged goods.  As a result, the defnding SNP candidate for Glasgow North in July was the outgoing Glasgow Central MP Alison Thewliss, who lost the seat to Labour candidate Martin Rhodes.  Rhodes had served in the past as a Glasgow councillor for Partick East/Kelvindale ward, which this column will visit next month.

At Holyrood level these three wards are in three different constituencies which all have SNP MSPs.  Glasgow Anniesland is represented by former Drumchapel/Anniesland ward councillor Bill Kidd; Glasgow Maryhill and Springburn's MSP is Bob Doris; while North East ward is covered by Ivan McKee's Glasgow Provan constituency.  McKee is a junior finance minister in the Scottish Government, while Doris and Kidd are on the backbenches.  The SNP are the largest party on Glasgow city coucnil, which they run as a minority with Green support.

So, we have three Glasgow by-elections which all look set to be fairly close fights on the basis of what happened in 2022.  The closest of these is clearly Drumchapel/Anniesland where the defending Labour candidate is Davina Rankin.  Interestingly, her one previous attempts at elected office came some years ago for the Conservatives: Rankin was their Holyrood candidate for Glasgow Cathcart in 2007 and she was a Westminster candidate in the 2008 Glasgow East by-election and for Glasgow South in 2010.  It takes all sorts to make a world.  The SNP's Adekemi Giwa, who runs a play centre in Drumchapel, will not be helped by having "(address in South Lanarkshire)" on her nomination papers.  The Conservatives have selected Steven Morrison, who contested the neighbouring Garscadden/Scotstounhill ward in 2022.  Also standing here are Christopher Lavelle for the Greens, former SNP ward councillor Elspeth Kerr as an independent candidate, Michael Shields for the Lib Dems and Allan Lyons for Reform UK.

On paper the best chance of an SNP gain is in Maryhill, where the defending Labour candidate Marie Garrity is seeking to get back on the council: Garrity previously served as a Labour councillor for East Centre ward from 2017 to 2022.  The SNP's Lorna Finn contested Dennistoun ward in both 2017 and 2022, finishing as runner-up on both occasions.  The Greens' Ellie Gomersall was also an unsuccesful Glasgow candidate in 2022, when she contested Cardonald ward on the south side of the city.  Also standing here are Susan McCourt for the Conservatives, Daniel O'Malley for the Lib Dems, Nick Durie for Alba and David McGowan for Reform UK.

Finally, in North East ward the Labour defence is led by Mary McNab who contested the neighbouring Baillieston ward in 2022.  Another losing 2022 candidate here is the young SNP candidate Kilian Riley, who stood in East Centre ward then.  As in Drumchapel/Anniesland and Maryhill, we have a ballot paper of seven candidates: also standing for North East ward are Thomas Haddow for the Conservatives, Hayley McDonald for the Greens, Anne McAllister for the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition, Robert McGregor for Reform UK and Peter McLaughlin for the Liberal Democrats.  The usual Scottish disclaimers apply here, with Votes at 16 and the Alternative Vote in use so please rank the candidates on your ballot paper in order of prefernce.

<h2>Swanscombe and Greenhithe</h2>

Kent county council; and

<h2>Greenhithe and Knockhall</h2>

Dartford council; both caused by the death of Swanscombe and Greenhithe Residents Association councillor Peter Harman.

We have now reached the third week of November, so (a little later than usual, for which I apologise) it is time to read out the following notice from the pulpit.

The six-month rule is now in effect in advance of the next ordinary local elections, which will take place on Thursday 1st May 2025.  If any councillors who are up for re-election in May 2025 die, resign or otherwise leave office between now and then, then there will be no by-election and their seats will be left vacant for the voters to full at the ordinary election in May.

With the exception of 2020 which we do not talk about here, next May's ordinary elections will be the quietest set for some years.  This is the year when the 21 remaining county councils come up for election, together with some unitary councils which are descended from county councils and two areas (Doncaster and Thurrock) which have non-standard electoral arrangements.  The mayors of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough, Doncaster, North Tyneside and the West of England will also be up for re-election, and we are likely to see elections for new mayoral posts covering Greater Lincolnshire, and Hull and East Yorkshire.  There will additionally be a gneral election for the Common Council of the City of London Corporation with polling on 20th March 2025, because of course the City is different.

This doesn't add up to all that many council seats, and there are only three vacancies at present which are for seats which will be up in 2025.  One of those is in Essex, where a county councillor and Chelmford city councillor has recently died and where by-elections for both seats will be held on 12th December.  Your column has a list of 40 by-elections in the diary before Christmas, which includes the 15 today, and those are the only two Conservative defences remaining this year.

The only other county council seat which might yet see a by-election before May is in Hertfordshire, where Conservative county councillor James Bond passed away at the start of November just before the six-month rule kicked in.  The campaigns officer for the Welwyn Hatfield Conservatives must have thought that was no time to die, because Bond's Hatfield North division is very marginal with a majority of just 0080 votes - and that was in May 2021, since when Conservative fortunes have taken a bit of a skyfall.  If a by-election is called for Hatfield North, all parties might end up throwing the living daylights at it.

So, our penultimate or antepenultimate county council by-election of the 2021-25 term comes on the southern bank of the Thames estuary in a county division which is changing very, very rapidly.  Greenhithe is a minor port on the Thames from which HMS <em>Erebus</em> and HMS <em>Terror</em> departed in 1845 on Franklin's ill-fated expedition to the north-west passage.  In 1862 Greenhithe became home to the Thames Nautical Training College, HMS <em>Worcester</em>, and the <em>Cutty Sark</em> was based here for a time as part of the college.  Shore facilities were then provided at Ingress Abbey, a 19th-century country house which has had a number of uses over the years: it's currently home to the very rich Canadian-born oil and gas tycoon Sanuel Malin and his wife, the Cameroon-born singer and model Irène Major.

Swanscombe lies away from the riverbank, and its economy was historically based on quarrying.  The local chalk is excellent for cement-making, and massive quarries pockmark the landscape around Swanscombe.  This doesn't always have good consequences: the main road east from Swanscombe towards Northfleet and Gravesend has had the land on either side of it quarried away so that it runs on top of a sheer chalk cliff, which collapsed last year - and the road has been closed ever since.

The quarry to the south of this collapsed road has been transformed out of all recognition into Ebbsfleet International railway station, a junction on High Speed 1 which was built as a stop for international Eurostar trains to Brussels, Paris and beyond - but no international trains have stopped here since the Covid pandemic.  Despite this, Ebbsfleet is a busy stop for domestic high-speed trains to St Pancras; and it's getting busier with the ongoing development of the Ebbsfleet Valley new town in the space between Swanscombe and the A2 Watling Street.  Ebbsfleet became a Dartford council ward of its own in 2019, and the electorate of Ebbsfleet ward increased by 140% in the following four years.

With the caveat that this may well be out of date by now given the development since, the 2021 census tells the story that the developers clearly wanted to sell: that Ebbsfleet ward is full of middle-class family homes.  It is the number 1 ward in England and Wales for households in shared ownership (12.0%), ranks at number 3 for full-time employment (60.3%) which is of a <em>far</em> more middle-class nature than the surrounding wards, ranks at number 4 for residents aged 30-44 (38.9%) and at number 40 for residents aged under 16 (28.2%), and comes in at number 7 for households with precisely one car or van (55.1%).  Neighbouring Swanscombe ward, by contrast, is in the top 100 wards in England and Wales for adults with Level 1 qualifications (that is, 1-4 GCSE passes or equivalent).

Swanscombe was an urban district of its own until 1974, and the old UDC area is now the parish of Swanscombe and Greenhithe.  This has its own Residents Association which contests elections, but it's fair to say that the Residents don't have at all their own way at election time with both the Conservatives and Labour mounting strong challenges.  In the 2021 Kent county council elections the Residents' Peter Harman held the Swanscombe and Greenhithe county seat with 40% of the vote, against 32% for Labour and 26% for the Conservatives.

Peter Harman had served on Kent county council since 2013 and on Dartford council since 2019, coming to politics from a 35-year career in the fire bridage.  When he passed away in August he was the only remining elected representative of the Swanscombe and Greenhithe Residents Association.  The SGRA did poorly in the 2023 elections to Dartford council, with the three wards covered by the Swanscombe and Greenhithe county division returning a total of four Labour councillors, three Conservatives and Harman; vote shares across the division were 38% for Labour, 37% for the Conservatives, 23% for the Residents (who didn't stand in Ebbsfleet ward, which is outside Swanscombe and Greenhithe parish) and 3% for Britain First's Paul Golding, who stood in Swanscombe ward.  Greenhithe and Knockhall, the Dartford ward up for election today, gave 45% to the Residents, 36% to the Conservatives (who won the other two seats) and 19% to Labour.

Overall the 2023 Dartford council election was one of the best Conservative results in what was generally a very poor year for the party.  The Tories successfully defended their majority and came out with the same number of seats - 29 out of 42 - that they had won in 2019.

Despite this, the Dartford constituency's record as a bellwether - it has voted for the government at every general election since 1964 - remains intact.  Boundary changes for the July 2024 election took one strongly-Conservative ward out of the Dartford constituency, and that might have made the difference in the final reasult: Labour's Jim Dickson, who served as leader of Lambeth council many years ago and still sits on that council, defeated the Conservatives' Gareth Johnson by just 1,192 votes.

The Swanscombe and Greenhithe Residents Association have no choice but to go all-in with their defence of these two by-elections.  They have nominated Dawn Johnston, the new party chair, as their defending candidate for both seats.  For the county by-election the Labour candidate is Victoria Akintomide-Akinwamide, who is a Dartford councillor for Ebbsfleet ward and works in financial regulation.  Another Dartford councillor on the ballot is the Conservatives' Carol Gale, who represents Greenhithe and Knockhall ward.  Also standing for the county seat are Thomas Mallon for Reform UK, Laura Edie for the Greens and James Willis for the Lib Dems.

In the Greenhithe and Knockhall district by-election the challenge to the Residents' Dawn Johnston will come from different Conservative and Labour candidates.  The Conservatives have selected Edith Nwachukwu, who was an unsuccessful candidate for Ebbsfleet ward last year.  The Labour candidate Peter Summers is a former trade union official; in 2023 he contested the very safe Conservative ward of Joydens Wood.  Also standing are Michael Brown for Reform UK and Green Party candidate Sacha Gosine, who was elected in 2019 as a Labour councillor for Ebbsfleet ward before falling out with the party.
