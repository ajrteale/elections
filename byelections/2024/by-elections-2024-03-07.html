One by-election on Wednesday 6th March 2024:
</p><p>
<h2>Elli</h2>
</p><p>
Carmarthenshire council, Mid and West Wales; caused by the resignation of independent councillor John Jenkins.
</p><p>
We kick the month of March 2024 off by travelling to Wales for a rare Wednesday by-election.  As to why this is ... well, elections in Wales have got a bit complicated.  This year the whole of Wales is due to go the polls for the Police and Crime Commissioner elections in May and also for the Westminster election at some point, and there will be some local by-elections to slot in as well.
</p><p>
One difficulty with slotting in these local by-elections is that Westminster, PCC and Welsh local elections now have three different franchises, as a result of reforms made by the Senedd in recent years.  The main difference between them is which foreign citizens have the right to vote.  Broadly speaking, citizens of the UK or citizens of Commonwealth countries who are legally resident in the UK can vote in Westminster elections if they are aged 18 or over.  Police and crime commissioner elections use the English local government franchise, which adds EU citizens who have settled status in the UK or who satisfy certain other tests.
</p><p>
The Welsh local government franchise goes further than this by granting the vote to anybody, whatever their nationality, who is legally resident in Wales - including 16- and 17-year-olds.  This definition is much simpler to understand and administer, but the differences from the more restrictive Westminster and PCC franchises are going to cause problems when those elections are held at the same time - there will be people attending polling stations (mostly 16 and 17 year olds) who will be eligible to vote in one election but not in the other.  With no fixed date for the next Westminster general election, some returning officers are very worried about this - hence the Carmarthenshire returning officer's attempt to avoid any possible clash of polls by scheduling this by-election for a Wednesday.  The returning officer for Bridgend, which this column will visit tomorrow on the traditional Thursday date, was clearly less concerned about this matter.
</p><p>
Which brings us to the Elli ward of Carmarthenshire.  This is named after St Elli, a son or daughter (depending which story you believe) of the fifth-century King Brychan who set up a church on the banks of the River Lliedi.  St Elli's church now forms the south-eastern corner of Elli ward, which is an entirely built-up area: it's the north-west corner of the town of Llanelli, along the Pembrey Road and the New Road.
</p><p>
Llanelli is the westernmost of the industrial towns of South Wales, being a traditional centre for the production of tinplate.  It has also retained a significant Welsh-speaking population, and this together with the fact that the Llanelli parliamentary seat includes rural areas outside the town means that Plaid Cymru is competitive here.  In Senedd elections Llanelli has often been closely fought between Labour and Plaid, with Labour wins by just 21 votes in the 2003 Assembly election and by 80 votes in 2011.  The current MS, Labour's Lee Waters, enjoys a rather more comfortable majority of 5,675.  Plaid have never broken through here in Westminster elections, wbere Llanelli has been a Labour seat continuously since 1922; indeed, Dame Nia Griffith (who has represented the town since 2005 and is currently the shadow minister for the Cabinet Office) is only the fourth MP to have represented this seat in the last century.
</p><p>
Plaid Cymru have more support in the areas of Carmarthenshire council outside the current Llanelli seat, and in the 2022 local elections they won an overall majority of one seat in the county: 38 seats against 23 Labour and 14 independent councillors.
</p><p>
Things are rather different in Elli ward, which is the most middle-class ward in Llanelli town.  It hit the headlines in 1993, at the last election to the former Dyfed county council, when a young lawyer called Robert Buckland won by 3 votes to become the first Conservative councillor in Llanelli for many a long year.  Buckland, who lost his seat to Labour at the first elections to the modern Carmarthenshire council two years later, went on to have a distinguished political career: during his time on Dyfed council he was the Tory candidate for South Wales West in the 1994 European Parliament elections and in the 1995 Islwyn by-election (where he lost his deposit).  Two more failed Parliamentary campaigns later, Robert Buckland finally made it to the green benches as Conservative MP for South Swindon; he went on to serve in government under four Conservative prime ministers, as Solicitor General for five years, as justice secretary and Lord Chancellor under Johnson, and finally as Welsh secretary.  He was appointed KBE shortly after leaving government in 2022, and now chairs the Commons Northern Ireland select committee.
</p><p>
Buckland never sat on the modern Carmarthenshire council.  His old seat in Elli ward voted Labour in 1995 and Lib Dem in 1999, before being gained for the Conservatives in 2004 by John Jenkins.  Jenkins is apparently notable enough for Wikipedia.  He had already hit the headlines after being selected as the Conservatives' prospective candidate for the Llanelli constituency in the 2003 Assembly election at the age of 22, then being forced to stand down over deeply homophobic remarks he made on a web forum.  Despite this history, in 2006 Jenkins was selected as the Conservatives' prospective candidate for Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire in the 2007 Assembly election, a post he held for just 24 hours before the above homophobic remarks were dragged out of the archives.
</p><p>
After this John Jenkins broke with the Conservatives, and he was re-elected in 2008 and at every Carmarthenshire election since as an independent candidate.  In 2022, on revised boundaries for Elli ward, he polled 48% of the vote against 27% for Labour and 10% for Plaid Cymru.  Jenkins stood down from the council in November after nearly 20 years' service, for health and family reasons: he has a young child and has been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.
</p><p>
Two independent candidates have come forward to succeed Jenkins.  Sharon Burdess was an independent andidate for the town's Lliedi ward in 2022, after failing to get the Labour nomination for those elections; Stephen Williams is a retired police officer and local resident.  Labour have selected Nick Pearce, who is the current Mayor of Llanelli and represents the ward on Llanelli town council.  The Plaid Cymru candidate is Steve Beckett, who runs a data protection consultancy in the town.  Also standing on a long ballot paper are Richard Williams for the Conservatives, Wayne Erasmus for Gwlad (a party campaigning for independence for Wales), Justin Griffiths for the Lib Dems and Hettie Sheehan for UKIP.

Four by-elections on 7th March 2024, and yet again we start with the big one:
</p><p>
<h2>Mayor of Lewisham</h2>
</p><p>
Lewisham council, London; caused by the resignation of Labour mayor Damian Egan.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/lewisham-2024.png" alt="Lewisham" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
We've seen some big parliamentary by-elections over the last month in the constituencies of Kingswood, Wellingborough and Rochdale.  Well, now it's time to go to another level with the biggest by-election of the year so far.  To start the week we have a Mayoral Special, with an entire London Borough going to the polls - an area covered by nearly three parliamentary seats.  On the December 2022 electoral register, the number of people eligible to vote here was around 199,000.
</p><p>
There has been a Lewisham borough since 1900, when the County of London had its local government reorganised from parishes into Metropolitan Boroughs.  The 1900 reorganisation created a Metropolitan Borough of Lewisham, essentially as a merger of the former Lee and Lewisham parishes; and a Metropolitan Borough of Deptford, covering the former parish of Deptford St Paul.
</p><p>
Deptford was an old industrial town thanks to its frontage on the River Thames, with busy and prosperous dockland.  In 1900 Lewisham still had large areas of open space, but these were quickly filled in with privately-built suburbs and then with the large council-built Downham estate.  Before the First World War Deptford and Lewisham had one MP each; Deptford had no room to expand, but by 1950 the population of Lewisham had grown enough for it to be divided into three constituencies.
</p><p>
In parliamentary elections, the Deptford constituency voted Conservative until 1900 and then Labour from 1906, with the sole exception of the 1931 landslide.  Lewisham returned Conservative MPs up until 1945, after which Lewisham South became safe Labour (thanks to the inclusion of the Downham estate) while the rest of the borough was marginal and closely fought.  A number of MPs for Lewisham in the postwar years were or became famous on the national stage: in that list we can count Herbert Morrison (Lab, Lewisham East 1945-50 and Lewisham South 1950-59), Christopher Chataway (C, Lewisham North 1959-66) and John Gummer (C, Lewisham West 1970-Feb 74).
</p><p>
The area has clearly swung to the left over the last half-century and has had a full slate of Labour MPs since 1992.  Lewisham's parliamentary delegation is currently all-female, with Vicky Foxcroft representing Deptford since 2015, Ellie Reeves taking on West and Penge (which also covers areas of the neighbouring Bromley borough) in 2017 and Janet Daby being elected for East at a 2018 by-election.  Foxcroft and Daby both have junior roles on the Labour frontbench team, while Reeves is the younger sister of the Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves and is the party's deputy national campaign coordinator.  Ellie Reeves' seat will be extensively redrawn for the next general election to become Lewisham West and East Dulwich, while the Boundary Commission have chosen to break with 139 years of history and remove Deptford from the parliamentary map at the next general election: Foxcroft's seat will be renamed as Lewisham North.  None of these changes should give the borough's Labour MPs anything to worry about.
</p><p>
In the 2021 London mayoral election the borough as a whole gave 51% to Labour's Sadiq Khan, 21% to the Conservatives' Shaun Bailey and 11% to the Greens' Siân Berry.  The London Members ballot, which determines the overall composition of the London Assembly, had 48% for Labour, 17% for the Greens and 16% for the Conservatives.  The Greater London returning officer has previously published ward-level breakdowns for all of these votes, but that will not happen for the 2024 elections to the London Mayor and Assembly and we will only get breakdowns to borough level.  With the abolition of the two-round system for the mayoral election, it may well be that those votes will now be counted by hand rather than scanned into a computer system.
</p><p>
The modern London Borough of Lewisham was created in 1965 by merging the former Deptford and Lewisham boroughs.  In local elections it has normally proven to be safe Labour: of the sixteen Lewisham council elections to date, fourteen have returned Labour majorities, one (the Labour disaster year of 1968) a Conservative majority and one (2006) a hung council.  The 2018 and 2022 council elections returned the entire Labour slate with 54 councillors out of a possible 54; the 2022 council vote shares in this one-party state were 52% for Labour, 22% for the Green Party and 13% for the Liberal Democrats.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2022/lewisham22.png" alt="Lewisham, 2022" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
This redwash also extends to the borough's mayor, because Lewisham was one of the first boroughs to adopt the elected mayoral system.  All six mayoral elections to date have returned the Labour candidate, and the elections from 2014 to 2022 were not required to go to a runoff under the then rules because the Labour candidate polled over 50% of the vote in the first round.
</p><p>
The first elected mayor of Lewisham was Steve Bullock, who was first elected to the council in 1982 and rose to become leader of the council before stepping down in 1998.  He then returned in a 2001 by-election, and was elected as mayor in 2002 with a 71-29 lead over the Conservatives in the runoff.  Bullock went on to win four terms of office, and he was knighted in 2007 for services to local government.
</p><p>
Sir Steve Bullock retired in 2018 after being drawn into a controversy over redevelopment plans for the area around Millwall FC's New Den ground, which is within the borough.  The Labour nomination went to Damian Egan, who had represented Lewisham Central ward since 2010 and was the council's cabinet member for housing, and Egan was duly elected in 2018 in the first round with 55% of the vote against 13% for the Conservatives and 10% for the Greens.  He won a second term in 2022 with an increased vote share, by 58-16 over the Greens.
</p><p>
Damian Egan is Irish by birth but grew up in the north-east suburbs of Bristol, where he started his political career at the age of 21 by being elected to Downend and Staple Hill parish council.  He stood for Parliament twice before being elected to Lewisham council, as Labour candidate for Weston-super-Mare in 2005 and for Beckenham in 2010.  Egan's parliamentary ambitions were clearly not over, and in 2023 he applied for and won the Labour selection for the new parliamentary seat of Bristol North East - defeating the unpopular elected mayor of Bristol, Marvin Rees, for that nomination.
</p><p>
In January 2024 Chris Skidmore, the Conservative MP for Kingswood, resigned his seat in the House of Commons over the Conservatives' policy on North Sea oil and gas.  The forthcoming Bristol North East constituency will take the most Labour-voting parts of the Kingswood seat when it is abolished at the next general election, and Egan was the obvious choice to be adopted as the Labour candidate for last month's Kingswood parliamentary by-election.  He resigned as mayor of Lewisham when his nomination papers went in for that poll, and was duly elected as MP for Kingswood three weeks ago - gaining that seat from the Conservatives.
</p><p>
For the resulting mayoral by-election Labour have selected Damian Egan's former deputy, who is already doing his old job on an acting basis.  Brenda Dacres is the Lewisham cabinet member for housing development and planning.  She has worked in IT since 1991 and was called to the Bar in 2006; in 2014 she was elected to Lewisham council, initially representing New Cross ward before transferring to Deptford ward in 2022 following boundary changes.  Should Dacres be elected, her council seat would be vacated and this column would quickly return to Deptford ward - which was profiled here last November - for the third entry in a chain of by-elections.
</p><p>
The Green Party are defending second place and hoping for more with their candidate Mike Herron.  He is an academic who has lived in the borough for 30 years.
</p><p>
Third here last time were the Conservatives, who polled 11.6%.  There is a famous name in the list of former Conservative candidates for Mayor of Lewisham: the Home Secretary James Cleverly, who was born in the borough, stood here in 2010 when he was merely the London Assembly member for Bexley and Bromley.  He also finished in third place.  This time the Lewisham Conservatives have selected Siama Qadar; she is an entrepreneur who has previously worked in City finance and now runs a vegetarian fashion brand.
</p><p>
The Lib Dems finished fourth here in 2022 with 9.8%; they have readopted as their candidate Chris Maines, a former Lewisham councillor and former Bromley councillor who has previously stood for Mayor of Lewisham in 2006, 2010, 2018 and 2022.  Another returning candidate from last time is Maureen Martin of the Christian Peoples Alliance, who is standing an an anti-knife crime ticket and whose 2022 campaign (1.5%, sixth out of seven candidates) led to trouble for her personally: Martin was sacked from her job at a housing association after the management objected to her manifesto opinion that marriage should be between a man and woman, and she subsequently extracted an undisclosed but substantial sum from her former employers for unfair dismissal.
</p><p>
Like the 2022 election, the Lewisham mayoral ballot paper has a total of seven candidates.  John Hamilton has been nominated by the Workers Party of Britain, George Galloway's outfit, but he has a long electoral history here: Hamilton has stood for mayor of Lewisham on four previous occasions as the candidate of a local left-wing slate, Lewisham People Before Profit, with previous vote shares of between 5% and 9%.  There is also an independent candidate, Nick Long, who is standing on a ticket of abolishing the mayoralty.

<h2>Upper Yeo and Taw</h2>
</p><p>
Mid Devon council; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Stuart Penny.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/m-devon-ur-yeo-taw.png" alt="M Devon, Ur Yeo/Taw" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Now for something completely different: an escape to the country.  It's certainly rather nice countryside here in the centre of Devon, as we come to a ward of eight parishes named after the two rivers which drain it.  The Taw flows north from Dartmoor to reach the sea at Barnstaple, and it is one of the two rivers in the story of <em>Tarka the Otter</em> by Henry Williamson.  As a result of this, the railway line from Exeter to Barnstaple - much of which runs through the Taw valley - is marketed as the Tarka Line.  The Lapford Yeo is a tributary of the Taw; it was once called the Nymet, a name which seems to come from a Celtic word for "shrine" and which may indicate that this area was seen as sacred.
</p><p>
Well, archaeologists have found the remains of a woodhenge to the west of the village of Bow, which lies on the Yeo about 15 miles north-west of Exeter.  This is effectively a failed town.  There are market charters from the 1250s which gave the local Norman squire, Henry de Tracey, the right to hold a weekly market and an annual three-day fair at Martinmas; to service this market the village of Bow grew up on the main road between Crediton and Okehampton.  However, the market and fair have been defunct for over a century, and Bow never achieved greatness.
</p><p>
Instead the major settlement in this ward is Copplestone, which grew up in the Taw valley around an ancient granite pillar which still stands in the centre of the village.  Copplestone is located on the main road between Exeter and Barnstaple and has a railway station on the Tarka Line.  Morchard Road railway station is also within the boundary; Eggesford station (one of two passing places on the line) is just outside the ward boundary but serves the village of Eggesford, which is part of this ward.
</p><p>
This area is part of the Central Devon parliamentary seat, which was created in 2010 and has been represented since then by Conservative MP Mel Stride.  He is a Cabinet minister, having served throughout the Sunak administration to date as Secretary of State for Work and Pensions.
</p><p>
Only a minority of the Mid Devon district is part of Stride's Central Devon constituency.  The district council is based in Tiverton, and the 2023 local elections here were seriously affected by the 2022 by-election in the Tiverton and Honiton parliamentary seat; a Conservative MP resigned after being caught watching pornography in the House of Commons, and the resulting by-election was gained by the Liberal Democrats.
</p><p>
At the time of that by-election Mid Devon council was hung and very messy, with a 2019 result of 18 Conservatives, 12 Lib Dems, 10 independents and 2 Greens resulting in a series of unstable independent-led administrations for the following four years.  This merry-go-round came to a stop after the 2023 elections, when the Lib Dems followed up on their parliamentary by-election success by winning a massive majority on the council: 33 seats against 5 Conservatives, 3 Greens and just one independent.
</p><p>
The remaining Conservative councillors are concentrated in the Central Devon wards, and Upper Yeo and Taw was one of three wards where the Conservatives topped the poll.  Only just, though; the Conservatives' lead over the Lib Dems was 43-41, with the two parties winning one seat each.  Upper Yeo and Taw is a new ward created by boundary changes last year; it takes in territory which was previously in Taw ward (the northern villages, including Eggesford), Upper Yeo ward (Bow) and Yeo ward (Copplestone).  The Conservative-LD split is also reflected in the 2021 Devon county council results: Bow and Copplestone are part of the Crediton county division which is Lib Dem-held, while the northern villages are in the safe Conservative county division of Creedy, Taw and Mid Exe.
</p><p>
Top of the poll here in 2023 was the Conservatives' Stuart Penny, who had first been elected in 2023 as one of the two councillors for Yeo ward.  He had briefly served in the Mid Devon cabinet during his first term, with the housing and property services portfolio.  Penny left the Conservative party last August and sat as an independent for a while, before submitting his resignation from the council in January for personal reasons.
</p><p>
Defending for the Conservatives is Peter Heal, who has appeared in this column before: he won a by-election in the former Taw ward for the Conservatives in May 2021, but finished as runner-up in this ward and lost his seat in 2023.  The Lib Dem candidate is another former councillor for the area: Alex White represented Upper Yeo ward from 2019 to 2023, when his seat disappeared in boundary changes, and he briefly served as Mid Devon's cabinet member for finance.  Also standing are Labour's Hayden Sharp, who lives within the ward in the wonderfully-named village of Zeal Monachorum, and the Greens' Mark Scotland.

<h2>Aberkenfig</h2>
</p><p>
Bridgend council, Glamorgan; caused by the resignation of Plaid Cymru councillor Ellie Richards.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/bridgend-aberkenfig.png" alt="Pen-y-bont ar Ogwr, Abercynffig" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
We now travel north from Devon over the Bristol Channel, and come to South Wales.  Here we find Aberkenfig, a village just to the north of Bridgend located at the confluence of three watercourses: the Ogmore, the Llynfi and a stream called the Cynffig or Kenfig all meet here.  The village has effectively merged with Sarn to the east and with Tondu to the north.  Its proximity to the M4 motorway (which is the ward's southern boundary) has encouraged some commuters to settle here: not just for Bridgend, but also for places further afield like Port Talbot, Cardiff and Swansea.
</p><p>
Aberkenfig lies within the community of Newcastle Higher.  The Aberkenfig ward also takes in the community of Llangynwyd Lower to the north, whose main settlement is the village of Coytrahen in the Llynfi valley - a slightly curious arrangement, because all communication links between Aberkenfig and Coytrahen pass through Tondu which is in a different ward.  The northern boundary of the ward passes through the middle of the Bridgend Paper Mill, which is next to the site of the former coal-fired Llynfi power station; rather cleaner energy from this ward is now exported from the Cwm Risca wind farm.  Also here is the farm of Cefn Ydfa, which in the eighteenth century was home to a maid called Ann Maddocks; according to legend, she was forced to marry the wealthy Anthony Maddocks against her wishes, and she died in 1727 pining for her true love Wil Hopcyn.
</p><p>
The local authority here is Bridgend council, which currently has a small Labour majority.  In the 2022 local elections Labour won 27 seats against 21 independents, 2 for Plaid Cymru and a single Conservative - the Tories lost 12 of their 13 council seats at the last election.  One of the Labour councillors for Bridgend Central resigned immediately to take up a well-paid job with the council, and the resulting by-election was won by an independent - reducing the Labour council majority to one seat.
</p><p>
Aberkenfig ward is currently part of the Ogmore constituency, which covers the valleys to the north of the town.  It has been represented continuously since its 1918 creation by Labour.  The current MS for the seat is Huw Irranca-Davies, who was elected as the MP for Ogmore in a 2002 by-election but resigned his Westminster seat in 2016 to successfully seek election to the Senedd.  The resulting Westminster by-election, held simultaneously with the 2016 Senedd election, was won by Chris Elmore.
</p><p>
Elmore's Westminster seat will disappear at the next general election, at which Aberkenfig will transfer into the Bridgend constituency.  This was a Conservative gain at the 2019 general election for Jamie Wallis, who has been a somewhat controversial figure during his time in office.  He came out as transgender in 2022 ("or to be more accurate, I want to be", to quote from his statement at the time) and has been described as the first openly-trans MP.  He continues to use male pronouns as far as I am aware.  Wallis also hit the headlines that year over a court appearance, which followed an arrest in 2021 after he crashed his car into a lamppost and then fled the scene.  Cardiff magistrates found him guilty of failing to stop and report an accident and leaving his car in a dangerous position; the district judge said he "didn't find the defendant credible in the evidence he gave", and Wallis was fined £2,500 and banned from driving for six months.  Jamie Wallis will stand down at the next general election, a decision which deprives us of an MP versus MP contest against Labour's Chris Elmore who is seeking re-election in the Bridgend constituency.
</p><p>
Rallings and Thrasher have projected that the Conservative majority in the redrawn Bridgend has notionally increased from 1,157 to 2,553 votes, so a win for Elmore will be counted as a Labour gain even though he is an incumbent.  This notional calculation seems rather counter-intuitive given the demographic nature of the areas moved in and out of the Bridgend seat; however, the commuter villages north of Bridgend are places where Labour has long underperformed in local elections.  Aberkenfig ward, for example, has never returned a Labour candidate to Bridgend council.  It was held by an independent councillor for eighteen years from 1999, then won by Plaid Cymru in 2017 and 2022.  Plaid enjoyed a 54-29 lead here over Labour two years ago.
</p><p>
Plaid councillor Ellie Richards was just 23 at the time of her election, when he she was one of just two Plaid Cymru Bridgend councillors alongside Llangynwyd ward councillor Malcolm James.  They are grandfather and granddaughter.  Unfortunately, Richards has been diagnosed with fibromyalgia and is suffering targeted harassment.  She submitted her resignation from the council in January to concentrate on her health, both mental and physical.
</p><p>
The resulting by-election has a candidate list which is curiously short.  Plaid Cymru are not defending their seat, meaning that they have lost group status on Bridgend council and this by-election is a free-for-all for an open seat.  Neither is there a Conservative candidate; the Tories have never previously contested this ward in local elections, but it is part of a marginal Westminster seat which they will be looking to defend very soon.  Instead we have a straight fight for the vacant belt between Labour's Gary Haines, who has lived in Aberkenfig for over fifty years and was a community councillor here many years ago; and between independent Luke Richards, a former medical delivery driver and former community councillor in Tondu who is turning his life around after being homeless for much of the last two years.  Richards has been endorsed by the main opposition group on the council, the Bridgend County Independents.

<h2>Hillhead</h2>
</p><p>
Glasgow council, Scotland; caused by the death of Labour councillor Hanzala Malik.

</p><p>
We finish for the week in the very trendy West End of Glasgow.  And when I say very trendy, that's an understatement.  The first time your columnist visited the Great Western Road I thought I'd died and gone to hipster heaven.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/glasgow-hillhead-2024.png" alt="Glasgow, Hillhead" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
The Hillhead ward runs from the Woodlands area on the edge of Glasgow city centre, just outside the M8 motorway, up the Great Western and Maryhill Roads.  The ward's western boundary is the Byres Road, where we find Hillhead itself: this is an area of upmarket housing to the west of the River Kelvin, which was once the western boundary of Glasgow city.  Hillhead was an independent burgh until 1891.
</p><p>
One of the reasons for all this youthful trendiness quickly becomes apparent from a walk through Hillhead.  This brings you to the University of Glasgow, the fourth-oldest university in the Anglosphere (after Oxford, Cambridge and St Andrews), which was founded by a papal bull in 1451.  Glasgow has educated three Prime Ministers (Viscount Melbourne, Henry Campbell-Bannerman and Andrew Bonar Law), three First Ministers (Donald Dewar, Nicola Sturgeon and Humza Yousaf) and a number of Nobel laureates.  William Thomson, the first scientist to make it to the House of Lords, was a Glasgow University professor for 53 years; he became the first Lord Kelvin in 1892, taking his title from the nearby river, and the SI unit of temperature - the kelvin - was named in his honour.
</p><p>
The Glasgow University campus also takes in the Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery, which originated as the private collection of the anatomist and physician William Hunter before being donated to the university on his death in 1783.  The gallery includes the Mackintosh House, a recreation of the former house at 78 Southpark Avenue which once belonged to Charles Rennie and Margaret Macdonald Mackintosh and which was demolished to make way for the university's expansion.  If you're not a fan of interior design, then a visit to the Mackintosh House might well change your mind: it simultaneously looks both like a work of art <em>and</em> like somewhere you might want to live.
</p><p>

</p><p>
A quick walk over the river brings us to the green open spaces of Kelvingrove Park and to some more art.  The Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum is run by the council from a grand building in the park, and its excellent collection includes one of the UK's great municipal artworks.  In 1952 Glasgow council bought the copyright to Salvador Dalí's painting <em>Christ of St John of the Cross</em> for £8,200, an investment which has proven to be a nice little earner over the years.  (Fun fact: the model for this painting was Gene Kelly's stunt double in <em>Singin' in the Rain</em>.)

</p><p>
We can't leave the Kelvingrove Art Gallery without giving you some music.  This building is not just about art and artifacts: the gallery also has a seriously large and impressive pipe organ overlooking its main hall, and organ recitals are given on weekdays and Saturdays at 1pm and on Sundays at 3pm.  Today's organist is scheduled to be Gordon Cree, of Renfield St Stephen's Church in Glasgow.  The organists' programmes here can be a bit more varied than the sort of fare you might get in a religious building.

I should also mention the pipe tune "The Rose of Kelvingrove", which my military band will play in a concert if you ask us nicely enough.

</p><p>
The Hillhead ward is linked together by the Glasgow Subway, with its tiny underground narrow-gauge trains connecting Hillhead ward with the city centre and the south of the river.  Hillhead, Kelvinbridge and St George's Cross subway stations all lie within the ward boundary.
</p><p>
St George's Cross is the main subway station serving the Woodlands area just to the north-west of the city centre.  In the days when Scottish council elections used single-member wards the councillor for Woodlands ward was Hanzala Malik, who was a local boy born to a Pakistani father and Scottish mother.  He enjoyed large majorities from his first election in 1995, as nearly all Glasgow Labour candidates did in those days.
</p><p>
In 2007 Malik's ward was swallowed up into a larger Hillhead ward, which then returned four councillors by proportional representation.  Its four seats split four ways at the inaugural election, with one each going to Labour, the SNP, the Green Party and the Lib Dems.  The SNP councillor died in 2011 and the party narrowly held the resulting by-election.
</p><p>
By this point Hanzala Malik had been elected to greater things.  He had been placed at the top of the Labour Party list for the Glasgow region at the 2011 Holyrood election, in what was thought to be an unwinnable position given that Labour had traditionally dominated the constituencies in Glasgow.  Slightly arrogantly, Scottish Labour thought that this would continue and decided that their Glasgow MSPs, including a number of the party's frontbench team, would seek re-election only as constituency candidates - which backfired badly when the Labour vote collapsed across Scotland in 2011 and the SNP won five of Glasgow's constituencies, including the Glasgow Kelvin seat which covers Hillhead ward.  Across the city Labour polled 35% of the list vote, entitling them to seven out of 16 MSPs; because the party had only won four constituencies, Hanzala Malik found himself propelled into the Scottish Parliament for the 2011-16 term.  He served during that time as deputy convenor of the Parliament's European and external relations committee.
</p><p>
As a result, Hanzala Malik stood down from Glasgow council in 2012.  He was not re-elected to Holyrood in 2016, and returned to the council chamber the following year as the Labour councillor for a rather different Hillhead ward to the one he had left.  The boundaries had significantly changed, removing Hyndland and adding North Kelvinside and the seriously upmarket Park District around Kelvingrove Park, and Hillhead ward now had three councillors rather than four.  On these boundaries those three seats have split one each to the Greens, the SNP and Labour at both the 2017 and 2022 Glasgow elections.
</p><p>
Shares of the vote in Hillhead ward two years ago were 36% for the Scottish Green Party, 29% for the Scottish National Party and 22% for Malik, who started 200 votes short of the 25% quota and easily made the shortfall up from Green transfers.  This was the only Scottish ward where the Greens topped the poll in 2022.  Overall, the 2022 Glasgow elections returned 37 Scottish National Party councillors, 36 for Labour, 10 for the Greens and 2 Conservatives; the SNP run the city as a minority, with Green support.
</p><p>
Hillhead used to be a famous constituency name in the days when Glasgow's Westminster seats had names rather than compass points.  The Hillhead constituency had just three MPs in the 49 years before its abolition in 1997: Tam Galbraith of the Conservatives represented the seat from a 1948 by-election until his death in 1982, the resulting by-election was a famous victory for Roy Jenkins of the SDP, and Jenkins lost his seat in 1987 to a young thirtysomething Labour candidate called George Galloway who was setting out on a long and winding Parliamentary career that brought him to Rochdale last week.  (Presumably he's clocked by now that Rochdale isn't <em>quite</em> as trendy as the West End of Glasgow.)  Galloway continued to represent Hillhead and its successor Glasgow Kelvin until that Westminster seat was abolished in 2005.
</p><p>
Glasgow Kelvin still exists for Holywood elections, where it has voted SNP since 2011.  In 2021 the Scottish Greens contested it, something which they rarely do in Holyrood elections, and the party's co-leader Patrick Harvie finished second with 25% of the vote.  He lost to new SNP candidate Kaukab Stewart, who recently became the first female non-white Scottish Minister with her appointment as minister for culture, Europe and international development.
</p><p>
The next Westminster boundary changes will unite Hillhead ward within the Glasgow North constituency, which has been held since 2015 by Patrick Grady of the SNP.  He served for several years as the party's chief whip at Westminster, but stood down from that role in 2021 following a complaint of sexual misconduct, and lost the party whip for a time in 2022 before being readmitted.  Glasgow loses a seat in the boundary changes, and the SNP have ensured that Grady will be the one who loses out even though it's not his seat which is abolished.  The party's candidate in the next Westminster election will be Alison Thewliss, the SNP's home affairs spokesman in the Commons, who currently represents the Park District as part of the doomed Glasgow Central seat.
</p><p>
Hanzala Malik's death in December sets up a tricky by-election defence for Labour.  They will need to improve on their 2022 vote share of 22% just to make the final two, and even that's no guarantee of winning.  Allan Faulds of Ballot Box Scotland has <a href="https://ballotbox.scot/preview-hillhead/">crunched the numbers</a> and reckons that a two-candidate runoff in 2022 would have been Green versus SNP, with the Greens taking it by 3,386 votes to 2,312 after transfers, or 59-41; a Green versus Labour runoff would have seen a wider Green margin.  So the likelihood is that we will see a change of council composition here.
</p><p>
Defending for Labour and top of the ballot paper is Ruth Hall, who contested Govan ward over the river in 2022.  The Greens have selected Seonad Hoy, a Glasgow University alumna who works in social housing.  Standing for the SNP - who are still looking for their first election win of any kind in the Humza Yousaf era - is Malcolm McConnell, who commutes into the area for work from his home in North Lanarkshire; he's not alone in that, because three of the seven candidates give addresses outwith the city.  Also standing are Faten Hameed, who was the Labour candidate for Glasgow Central at the 2017 and 2019 Westminster election but now has the Conservative nomination, Daniel O'Malley for the Liberal Democrats, Alistair McConnachie for his own far-right party which has the only slightly misleading name "Independent Green Voice", and independent candidate Ryan McGinley.
