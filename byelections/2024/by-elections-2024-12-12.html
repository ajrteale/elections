Six by-elections on 12th December 2024:
</p><p>
<h2>Ottershaw</h2>
</p><p>
Runnymede council, Surrey; caused by the death of independent councillor Malcolm Cressey.
</p><p>
Of the seats up for election today, there are two defences each for the Conservatives and Labour and one each for the Lib Dems and an independent.  We'll start with the independent defence in Ottershaw, which lies in leafy Surrey just outside the M25 motorway - a few miles to the north of Woking.  The ward boundary also contains part of Row Town and crosses the M25 to take in a small portion of Addlestone to the east.
</p><p>
Ottershaw ward was created in 2019, before which Ottershaw village had been the main settlement in Foxhills ward.  This name was a tribute to the eighteenth-century Whig statesman Charles James Fox, whose mistress and later wife Elizabeth Armistead had a country house here where they lived.  Fox has gone down in history as the UK's first foreign secretary, serving in that role for three short periods: in 1782 during the Rockingham administration, in 1783 during the Fox-North coalition, and then briefly before his 1806 death as part of the Ministry of All the Talents.  But he spent most of his political career in opposition to Pitt the Younger's government, which at least gave him time to indulge in a notoriously colourful personal life.
</p><p>
The old Foxhills ward was previewed by this column in March 2013 for a by-election in which UKIP gained what had been a safe Tory ward.  The Conservatives got that seat back in 2015, but Ottershaw has not been immune to the general collapse of the Surrey Conservatives over the following decade.  Foxhills ward returned two independent councillors at its last election in 2018, and Ottershaw ward has continued in that vein.  There has been a full slate of independents here since 2021, and in May the ward voted 46% for independent Carl Mann, 24% for the Conservatives and 17% for Labour.
</p><p>
The leader of this independent charge was Malcolm Cressey, who had sat on Runnymede council since being elected for the old Foxhills ward in 2018; he was re-elected in Ottershaw ward in 2019 and 2022.  He was leader of the council's Ottershaw Independent group, which is not part of the rainbow coalition of Labour, Lib Dem, Residents, Green and independent councillors which runs the hung council; before that rainbow coalition came to power in May, the Ottershaw independent councillors had given confidence and supply to a Conservative minority administration.  Malcolm Cressey passed away in October; but there is still a Cressey on the council, because his son Michael Cressey is one of the other councillors for Ottershaw ward.
</p><p>
Malcolm Cressey had also stood for election to Surrey county council in 2021 as an independent candidate, finishing as a rather distant runner-up in the Foxhills, Thorpe and Virginia Water division which covers most of Ottershaw ward.  Two other Surrey county council divisions contain territory from this ward, and both of those are also Conservative-held.  The ward is part of the Runnymede and Weybridge parliamentary seat, which easily re-elected its Conservative MP Ben Spencer in July.
</p><p>
One independent candidate has come forward to succeed Malcolm Cressey: Robert Day was last seen on a ballot paper in 2021, when he contested the neighbouring ward of Woodham and Rowtown.  The Conservatives' Mike Kusneraitis is seeking to return to Runnymede council after representing Englefield Green West ward from 2006 to 2022; Kusneraitis actually lost re-election in 2022 as an independent candidate, but it would appear he is now back in the Tory fold.  Labour's Anne Emerson-Miller, a teacher who finished third here in May, is back for another go.  Also on the Ottershaw ballot are Peter Chiverton for the Greens, Ronan McCaughey for the Lib Dems and Mayuran Senthilnathan for Reform UK.

<h2>Stock</h2>
</p><p>
Essex county council; and
</p><p>
<h2>South Hanningfield, Stock and Margaretting</h2>
</p><p>
Chelmsford council, Essex; both caused by the death of Conservative councillor Ian Grundy.
</p><p>
In by-elections over the last few months, one area we haven't heard much from is the Tory shires.  There are very few Conservative-held seats coming up for election at the moment, which shows just how far the party has sunk in local government in recent years.  Today's two council by-elections in Essex are the first Tory by-election defences since the first week of November, and the only ones this month.
</p><p>
The Stock division of Essex county council covers nine parishes in the countryside south of Chelmsford.  Stock, on the road between Chelmsford and Billericay, is one of those parishes and has 1,689 voters on the roll.  The largest of the 16 polling stations in this division is at Bicknacre, a village to the north of South Woodham Ferrers which was once home to an Augustinian priory - one arch of that building remains.  But the most populous parish in this division is now Runwell, which now forms a single urban area with the town of Wickford to the south - and more new houses are springing up here next to the A130 dual carriageway between Chelmsford and the Thames Estuary towns to the south.  Battlesbridge, a railway station on the Southminster branch line, is the division's railhead.
</p><p>
Stock county council division includes the Royal Horticultural Society's garden at Hyde Hall, and it is centred on Hanningfield Reservoir which was built in the 1950s and is noted for its large population of gadwall ducks.  Nearby are the three villages of East Hanningfield, South Hanningfield and West Hanningfield.
</p><p>
Another Hanningfield associated with this area was Paul White, who hit the headlines in 1955 when he was named as the UK's youngest pig farmer - at the time White was 15 years old and living in West Hanningfield.  White quickly got into politics via the National Farmers Union, and in 1962 he became the chairman of Essex Young Farmers and joined the executive of the Chelmsford branch of the Conservatives.  In 1970 White was elected as the Essex county councillor for Stock division, which in those pre-reorganisation days was part of the Chelmsford Rural District.
</p><p>
Paul White went on to have a long political career.  He became leader of the Conservative group on Essex county council in 1993, and he was the first leader of the Conservative group on the Local Government Association when it was founded in 1997.  William Hague then nominated White for a peerage the following year, and he took his seat in the Lords with the title of Lord Hanningfield.  Hanningfield led Essex county council briefly from 1998 to 1999, and then returned for a longer stint which lasted from 2000 to 2010 and included plans for a "Bank of Essex" to invest in local businesses.
</p><p>
Lord Hanningfield's period as leader of Essex county council ended in February 2010 when he was charged with false accounting relating to his House of Lords expenses.  The charges detailed that he had falsely claimed for overnight stays in London when in fact he had gone back home to Essex or (on one occasion) he was on a plane to India.  In 2011 a jury at Chelmsford crown court found Hanningfield guilty on all six counts, and in July of that year he was sentenced to nine months' imprisonment.  His sentence automatically disqualified him as a councillor, but didn't disqualify him from acting in the House of Lords which allowed him back in April 2012 after he paid back £30,000 in wrongly-claimed expenses.  Hanningfield clearly didn't learn his lesson, and he was suspended from the Lords in 2014 for further expense fraud; only a claim of parliamentary privilege by the Lords authorities stopped him being prosecuted again.  He died in October, aged 84.
</p><p>
The Essex county council by-election to replace the disgraced Lord Hanningfield took place in September 2011 and was won by the Conservatives' Ian Grundy who had held the seat ever since.  Grundy was the Essex cabinet member for highways from 2017 to 2018.  He won his fourth and final term on the county council in 2021 with a 69-10 lead over Labour, demonstrating just how true-blue this area is.
</p><p>
Grundy had also been a Chelmsford city councillor since 2003, representing South Hanningfield, Stock and Margaretting (cumbersome ward names are a theme in Chelmsford) alongside Roy Whitehead who leads the Conservative opposition on that council.  Chelmsford is sharply divided between a Lib Dem majority concentrated in the wards covering the urban area and a Conservative minority in the rural parishes surrounding it; South Hanningfield, Stock and Margaretting ward is definitely in the latter category, and councillors Grundy and Whitehead were last re-elected in 2023 with a 74-16 lead over the Lib Dems.
</p><p>
The true-blue theme continues at Parliamentary level.  Stock county division (and the South Hanningfield etc city ward, which ie entirely contained within it) is part of the Maldon constituency which is represented by the Conservatives' Sir John Whittingdale.  Whittingdale served in David Cameron's cabinet from 2015 to 2016 as culture secretary, and he is a very long-serving MP as one of only six survivors from the 1992 intake - just five MPs have longer continuous service.  He secured his ninth term of office in July with a majority of 6,906 votes over Reform UK.
</p><p>
So the Conservatives shouldn't have too much trouble defending these by-elections following the death of Ian Grundy, who passed away in October - just four days after Lord Hanningfield's death - at the age of 85.  Grundy had been receiving treatment for cancer.
</p><p>
The county council by-election in Stock division has a larger field of six candidates.  The defending Conservative candidate here is Sue Dobson, who is a Chelmsford city councillor representing the ward of (lovers of the Oxford comma please look away now) Bicknacre and East and West Hanningfield.  The Labour candidate is Stephen Capper, a headteacher who contested Little Baddow, Danbury and Sandon ward in last year's Chelmsford elections; he fought Maldon in the 2021 Essex county elections and in the 2019 general election.  Also standing here are independent Paul Clark (who represents Rettendon and Runwell ward on the city council and finished third here in 2021 with the nomination of the Independent Network), Christine Shaw for the Lib Dems, Edward Massey for the Greens and Thomas Allison for Reform UK.
</p><p>
In the city council by-election for South Hanningfield, Stock and Margaretting the Conservative defence is led by Gillian Bonnett, who comes from a farming family and served from 2002 to 2023 on South Hanningfield parish council.  The other three candidates are all standing in the county council by-election as well including the Lib Dems' Christine Shaw; she is a parish councillor in Great Baddow, which is not part of this ward.  Labour's Stephen Capper and the Greens' Edward Massey complete this ballot.

<h2>Blackbrook</h2>
</p><p>
St Helens council, Merseyside; caused by the death of Labour councillor Linda Maloney.
</p><p>
We have two Labour defences to bring you today in the North of England, one each side of the Pennines.  On the west side we come to the northern end of St Helens, where the Black Brook is bridged by the A58 road towards Ashton-in-Makerfield.  This waterway has now been superseded by the abandoned Sankey Canal which linked the industry of St Helens to the Mersey estuary at Widnes, and a branch of this canal goes up the Black Brook valley.
</p><p>
St Helens is of course rugby league territory.  Blackbrook ward doesn't have a professional RL club of its own, but the Blackbrook amateur and junior side has a long-standing reputation for training young players who go on to successful professional careers in the sport.  Several of St Helens' Men of Steel in the early 2000s had started off in rugby league as Blackbrook juniors.
</p><p>
St Helens council is one of five metropolitan boroughs which have moved off the thirds cycle and hold annual elections.  Confusingly, they have mostly ended up on different years of the electoral cycle: Doncaster will next poll in 2025, Rotherham was up this year, Liverpool and Wirral last went to the polls in 2023, and St Helens hasn't had any local elections since 2022 when the present boundaries of Blackbrook ward were introduced.  In that election the Labour slate was elected with a lead of 53-29 over the Green Party, who are the largest opposition group on the Labour-controlled St Helens council.  Blackbrook ward had also been safely Labour in previous years this century.
</p><p>
The ward is part of the St Helens North constituency, where Labour's David Baines - who had previously been leader of St Helens council - made the step up to Parliament in July with a majority of 12,169 votes over Reform UK.  Baines took the seat over from the retiring Conor McGinn, who had lost the Labour whip in 2022 over an unspecified complaint which never seems to have been satisfactorily dealt with - partly because McGinn quit the Labour party in 2023 in frustration at the complaints process.  Conor McGinn was originally from South Armagh, and his father had been a Sinn Féin councillor in Newry and Mourne.
</p><p>
This by-election is to replace veteran Labour councillor Linda Maloney following her death at the end of September.  Maloney had served as a Blackbrook ward councillor continuously since her first election in 1994, and her offices on the council include a spell as deputy mayor and service in the cabinet.  In the 2019 New Year Honours Maloney was appointed MBE for her political service.
</p><p>
We have another MBE on today's ballot, as the defending Labour candidate Sally Yeoman received that award in the 2022 Birthday Honours for services to the community: she is the CEO of Halton and St Helens Voluntary and Community Action.  The Green candidate is Daniel Thomas, who was previously the Greens' parliamentary candidate for St Helens North in July.  Also standing are Thomas Dodd for the Conservatives, Victor Floyd for Reform UK and independent candidate Trevor McLaughlin.

<h2>Featherstone</h2>
</p><p>
Wakefield council, West Yorkshire; caused by the death of Labour councillor Graham Isherwood.
</p><p>
Let's now cross to Yorkshire, where your columnist is busy tonight playing Christmas music.  My military band in Lancashire has recently appointed a new musical director, who also runs the Yorkshire Volunteers Band: they have a rather nice annual job playing music for Christmas carol concerts in York Minster each December, and I'm over there tonight to bolster the Yorkshire Vols' clarinet section.  This does mean literally cosplaying as a Yorkshireman, but that's a small price to pay for the chance to make music in such wonderful surroundings.  Here are the Yorkshire Vols in action with some festive music.
</p><p>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rem0woSh9C4
</p><p>
We also have two Yorkshire by-elections to bring you today, both of which are in the small towns of the West Riding.  Featherstone lies a few miles east of Wakefield on the railway line towards Pontefract, which was reopened in 1992 after being closed by Beeching.  The modern town of Featherstone lies around the railway station, but this wasn't always the case: the original Featherstone was a separate village a mile or so to the north which is now called North Featherstone, while the modern Featherstone runs seamlessly into the former village of Purston Jaglin.
</p><p>
Historically the main industry here was coalmining, with Featherstone Main and Ackton Hall collieries providing employment for the area.  Not always continuously though: a slump in the coal price in 1893 led to a national lockout of mineworkers, and a protest in Featherstone at the colliery gates was fired upon by soldiers.  Two people died.  Ackton Hall colliery was the first pit to close after the 1980s miners strike - a result of geological rather than political problems - and other industries now dominate this area.  Featherstone ward includes the eastern half of the massive Normanton industrial estate next to the M62 motorway, with distribution centres for Asda and The Range joined by that most modern of industries - a large data centre for HSBC.
</p><p>
We're still in rugby league territory, and second-tier side Featherstone Rovers have a stadium on Post Office Road which has been expanded in recent years: two stands which were previously located at the McCain football stadium in Scarborough were moved here in 2011 after Scarborough FC went out of business.  Post Office Road has hosted a number of international or tour matches over the years, and it also came to prominence in 2007 when it was officially renamed as the Chris Moyles Stadium after the radio presenter of that name.  Its current official name is the Millennium Stadium, after its sponsor Millennium Support.
</p><p>
The modern Featherstone ward is based on the current Featherstone parish (although the ward boundaries are yet to be revised to take account of recent parish boundary changes) plus the parish of Sharlston to the west.  It has had a full slate of Labour councillors on Wakefield council since 2012, when Labour gained the final seat previously held by an independent slate.  Since then Labour votes here have been weighed rather than counted, and the Labour lead here in May was 73-15 over the Conservatives.  Many contests here in recent years have been straight Labour-Conservative fights, with Labour capable of cracking 80% in a good year; it's rare for radical-right parties to stand here, although the BNP polled decently in 2004 and UKIP got over 20% in 2015.  The MP here has been Labour's Jon Trickett since he won the Hemsworth parliamentary by-election in 1996; Trickett secured his ninth term of office in July, winning the redrawn seat of Normanton and Hemsworth by 6,662 votes over Reform UK.
</p><p>
This by-election is to replace a veteran of local government.  Graham Isherwood, who passed away in October, had served on Featherstone town council for over 35 years since his first election in 1987.  He was mayor of Featherstone in the millennium year 2000.  In 2011 Isherwood made the step up to Wakefield council, taking over a seat previously held by an independent councillor.  He won his fourth four-year term of office in 2023, but the winner of this by-election will have that cut short: the Local Government Boundary Commission for England have recently completed a review of Wakefield, and their final ward map - with fairly minimal changes from the present arrangements - was published last week.  An all-out election will be held in Wakefield in 2026, in which the Featherstone ward boundary will catch up with the new parish boundary.
</p><p>
Defending this seat for Labour is Featherstone town councillor and Communication Workers Union rep Scott Haslam.  The Conservative candidate Pepe Ruzvidzo is a registered nurse who runs a firm providing care services to vulnerable people in the area; she has regularly contested South Elmsall and South Kirkby ward in recent years.  Also standing are Alexander Wood for the Green Party, Waj Ali for Reform UK (he was their West Yorkshire mayoral candidate in 2021) and Christopher Howden for the Lib Dems.

<h2>Dodworth</h2>
</p><p>
Barnsley council, South Yorkshire; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Sam Christmas.
</p><p>
We finish for the week with another ward in the small towns of the West Riding.  Dodworth lies just to the west of Barnsley, from which it is separated by the M1 motorway; the Dodworth ward extends over the motorway to take in some eastern fringes of Barnsley proper.  This is another former coalmining town, with the former colliery site now given over to industrial units: here can be found the headquarters of Galpharm, a company which was founded here in 1982 and grew to become the UK's largest supplier of over-the-counter medicine.  Galpharm, which once sponsored the main football and rugby league stadium in Huddersfield, was taken over by an American firm in 2008.  Dodworth railway station, on Northern Rail's Penistone Line, was reopened in 1989.
</p><p>
So far this will all be eerily reminiscent of Featherstone in the previous entry.  And indeed Dodworth is part of a local government district with a massive Labour majority (Barnsley) and returned a full slate of independent councillors at its first election in 2004.  But Featherstone's and Dodworth's politics are very different.
</p><p>
The 2004 elections in Barnsley returned a rather close result, with a Labour majority group of 33 seats against 22 independent councillors (including all three councillors for Dodworth ward), 5 Conservatives and 3 Lib Dems.  The independent councillors then registered as a political party - the Barnsley Independent Group - and struggled for control of Barnsley council over the next few years, but Labour just about managed to hold their majority.  BIG's fortunes then waned in the 2010s, but they mostly hung on in Dodworth ward where Labour only broke through in 2015 and 2018.
</p><p>
Also in 2018, the Liberal Democrats got back onto Barnsley council by gaining the rural Penistone West ward from the Conservatives.  In 2019 the Lib Dems then had a go at Dodworth ward, and they ended up rather convincingly gaining it from Labour.  Further Lib Dems gained followed from the Barnsley Independent Group in 2021 (on a freak vote split with just 26%) and from Labour in 2022.  The Liberal Democrats are now the official opposition on Barnsley council, and they enjoyed a 51-35 lead over Labour in Dodsworth in May.  The Barnsley Independent Group are now defunct.
</p><p>
Since 1950 Dodworth has been linked for Parliamentary purposes with Penistone, and it is currently part of the Penistone and Stocksbridge constituency.  This briefly had Lib Dem representation in 2019, when Labour MP Angela Smith ended up in that party after a spell in Change UK, or the Independent Group, or whatever it was they were called that week.  Smith bizarrely sought re-election in Altrincham and Sale West, where she finished third, and her old seat was a Conservative gain in the 2019 general election - that was five years ago today.  Tory backbencher Miriam Cates was then defeated in 2024 by Labour's Marie Tidball, a disability rights campaigner who grew up in Penistone and has previously served on Oxford council.
</p><p>
This by-election is being defended by the Lib Dems following the resignation of Sam Christmas, who was first elected here in 2023 and stood down in November citing work commitments.  Some spoilsports in the Barnsley Lib Dems then asked for the resulting by-election to be held on 12th December, thus denying me the opportunity to have the last Andrew's Previews before Christmas closed with a by-election following the resignation of Councillor Christmas.  Curses.  I'll have to think of something else festive for next week's column now.
</p><p>
Defending this seat for the Lib Dems is Andy Waters, who has regularly contested the neighbouring Penistone East ward in recent years.  The Labour candidate Kate Hutchinson is a small business owner.  Also standing are Steven Burkinshaw for the Conservatives, Eric Hodgson for Reform UK and Trevor Mayne for the Greens.
