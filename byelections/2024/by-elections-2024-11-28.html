<h2>Frampton Cotterell</h2>

South Gloucestershire council; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Claire Young.

The only English ward up for election today which can reasonably be described as rural is in south Gloucestershire.  Frampton Cotterell is a village just off the northern edge of Bristol's built-up area; it has seen huge population growth in recent years, and it has essentially merged with the neighbouring village of Coalpit Heath which is still part of a separate parish.  The Frampton Cotterell ward, which is clearly the bits that were left over after the neighbouring wards were satisfactorily sorted out, takes in three other parishes to the north: this area includes the industrial western fringe of the town of Yate together with the village of Tytherington.

The names of the villages of Coaplit Heath and Iron Acton indicate that there is coal and iron in the local rocks, and a number of villages in what is now Frampton Cotterell ward once had iron or coal mines.  Tytherington's economy is still dominated by a large limestone quarry next to the M5 motorway.  Today the nearly big city of Bristol provides most of the area's employment, and for commuters Yate railway station lies on the ward boundary.

Frampton Cotterell ward's current boundaries date from 2019, and previous wards of that name were substantially smaller than the present ward.  The 2019 boundary changes brought in both part of the abolished Westerleigh ward and long-serving Lib Dem councillor Claire Young, who had first been elected in 2007 for Westerleigh ward.  On its present boundaries Frampton Cotterell has proven to be safe Liberal Democrat, with Young enjoying a substantial personal vote: shares of the vote here in 2023 were 52% for the Lib Dems and 34% for the Conservatives.  The Conservatives lost control of South Gloucestershire council in 2023, and Young became leader of the council at the head of a Lib Dem-Labour coalition.

Claire Young also had Parliamentary ambitions, and in July 2024 she was elected at her third attempt as the Liberal Democrat MP for Thornbury and Yate - the seat which includes Frampton Cotterell ward.  She defeated Luke Hall, the previous Conservative MP, by the narrow margin of 3,014 votes.  Following her election to Westminster, Young stood down as the leader of South Gloucestershire council before tendering her resignation as a councillor.

Defending this seat for the Lib Dems is David Goodwin, who sits on Frampton Cotterell parish council (where he chairs the climate and nature committee) and works for Rolls-Royce.  Another candidate who has worked in the local aerospace industry is the Conservatives' Tim Niblett, who was an unsucceesful candidate here in 2023 and is back for another go.  Also standing are Alan Lankester for the Greens and Jonathan Trollope for Labour.

<h2>Woodhouse</h2>

Sheffield council, South Yorkshire; caused by the death of councillor Paul Wood.

We now come to two polls in Yorkshire, starting in the city of Sheffield.  Well, more accurately we're in a small-town area on the eastern edge of Sheffield.  Woodhouse itself is a former mining village a few miles to the east of Sheffield city centre, to which it is linked by a railway station on the line towards Retford and Lincoln.  This line may gain a new station here in the near future, to serve the large and very new Waverley development on the former site of Orgreave colliery; Waverley itself is however in Rotherham borough, on the far side of the railway.  Woodhouse ward also includes much of Handsworth, the area where the actor Sean Bean grew up.  Handsworth used to be an urban district of its own, with boundaries which covered Woodhouse, before it was annexed by Sheffield in 1938.

Today this area is working-class suburbia with a very strong Labour vote in local elections.  In May Labour enjoyed a 58-14 lead over the Cosnervatives here; in July Woodhouse ward polled as part of the Sheffield South East constituency, which re-elected its Labour MP Clive Betts for his ninth term of office by a slightly less commanding margin.  Sheffield South East was one of the few constituencies which had no Reform UK candidate this year, because the party had an electoral pact with the Social Democatic Party and stood down here in the SDP's favour.  Not that this did the SDP much good: their candidate finished in seventh and last place and lost his deposit.

Sheffield city council is hung, with the latest composition having 36 Labour councillors, 27 Lib Dems, 14 Greens, 1 independent and 5 seats for the Sheffield Community Councillors, a group associated with the former council leader Terry Fox.  Fox was effectively forced out of the Labour group leadership by the national party in May 2023 for his role in the 2014-18 Sheffield tree felling scandal, and in September 2023 he was one of seven Sheffield Labour councillors to be suspended by the party.

Paul Wood was not one of those seven, but he subsequently quit Labour and joined the Sheffield Community Councillors group.  Wood had spent most of his career on the cabaret circuit, managing household names and touring with pop stars; he had entered local politics in 2014 as a Labour councillor for Sheffield's Richmond ward, before transferring to Woodhouse ward in 2016 following boundary changes.  In the 2014 Birthday Honours Wood was awarded the British Empire Medal, for his political service as a board member of Labour's Yorkshire and Humber region.  He passed away in September at the age of 67.

The Sheffield Community Councillors are not registered as a political party, and there is no defending independent candidate in this by-election.  So Labour will be hoping that Wood's seat will now revert to their candidate Saj Ghafur, a taxi driver who has chaired local tenants and residents' associations.  The Conservatives have turned to the next generation with their candidate Samuel Hemsley, who is a student reading politics and international relations at the University of Sheffield.  Also standing are Hannah Nicklin for the Greens, Willis Marshall for the Lib Dems, Joshua Crapper for the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition, Andy Hizzard for Reform UK (who will note that UKIP had a good result here in 2019) and Matthew Leese for the Social Democratic Party.  We can infer from this candidate list that the Reform-SDP pact has broken down.

<h2>Haxby and Wigginton</h2>

York council, North Yorkshire; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Ed Pearson.

Our second Lib Dem defence of the week is in Haxby, a small York commuter town which lies just outside the ring road to the north of the city.  Haxby has seen strong population growth in recent decades which has effectively caused it to merge with the neighbouring village of Wigginton to the west, and the Haxby civil parish became a town in 1992.  Together, Haxby and Wigginton have a commuter profile with high levels of owner-occupation and a rather older population than average.

This area was annexed by York as recently as 1996, when York became a unitary council.  The pre-1996 York city council had very tight boundaries which excluded many of the city's suburbs and outlying villages, and until then Haxby and Wigginton were administered from Malton as part of the Ryedale district.

The present city of York is the right size for two parliamentary seats, and it duly got two MPs in 2010 with a curious bullseye arrangement: the York Central constituency, covering the old city, is completely surrounded by the suburban seat of York Outer.  The Outer seat voted Conservative in the 2010s but was a very emphatic gain in July 2024 for the Labour candidate Luke Charters, who had previosuly stood here in 2017 as a 21-year-old.  Charters had been elected in 2022 to Newham council in London, but he gave that seat up the following year after winning the Labour nomination for York Outer (<em>Andrew's Previews 2023</em>, page 280).

Labour have a much more narrow overall majority on York city council, which they gained in 2023 following a controversy over the previous Lib Dem-led administration banning blue-badge disabled parking in pedestrianised areas of the city centre.  Last year's elections resulted in 24 Labour councillors, 19 Lib Dems, 3 Conservatives and an independent, with the Green Party group being wiped out.

That's a Labour majorty of one seat, which is not at risk in this by-election.  It's unlikely that Labour will increase their lead here because they are normally also-rans in Haxby and Wigginton ward, which in 2023 voted 53% for the Liberal Democrats, 23% for the Conservatives and 14% for Labour.  The Tories actually won two out of three seats here in 2015, but they are going to have to come back from a long way behind to repeat that performance now.  This by-election is to replace Lib Dems councillor Ed Pearson, who had served the ward since 2019; he stood down last month to concentrate on his career on the railways and to spend more time with his family.

Defending this seat for the Lib Dems is Richard Watson, who is seeking to make a political comeback.  Watson, who has recently retired from a long legal career, was first elected all the way back in 1987 as a Liberal/SDP Alliance councillor for the former Haxby North East ward of Ryedale district; he then repsented Haxby West ward of Ryedale council from 1991 to 1995, Haxby ward of York council from 1999 to 2003 and this ward of York council from 2003 to 2011 when he stood down.  The Conservatives have selected Jessie Secker, who is a Haxby town councillor.  Another former York city councillor on the ballot is Labour's James Flinders, who previously represented the city-centre Guildhall ward from 2015 to 2019.  The Greens' Ian Lowson and Reform UK's John Crispin-Bailey complete this candidate list.
