<h2>Credenhill</h2>

Herefordshire council; caused by the death of independent councillor Bob Matthews.

We now finally arrive in England within the beautiful Welsh Marches.  Although there's more industry here than you might think, and the village of Credenhill a few miles to the north-west of Hereford gave us a well-known brand.  In 1887 the rector of Credenhill was called Charles Bulmer; his 20-year-old son Percy decided to go into business and founded a cider-making company, originally with apples from the rectory gardens.  H P Bulmer Ltd became the world's largest producer of cider and still sources much of its apples from Herefordshire: it's now owned by Heineken, and the Bulmers and Strongbow brands still account for over half of the UK's cider production.

A couple of centuries earlier the rector of Credenhill was Thomas Traherne, who served the parish from 1657 to 1667 during the turbulent times of the Restoration.  Today Traherne is remembered as a holy man by the Church of England, which commemorates him on 10th October, and for his poetry and theological writings which attracted little attention in his lifetime or for centuries afterwards: his best-known work, <em>Centuries of Meditations</em>, was not published until 1908.  Once Thomas Traherne's writings were rediscovered they inspired a number of composers in the UK and abroad: see, for example, Gerald Finzi's cantata <em>Dies Natalis</em> which set four of Traherne's texts to music.

During the Second World War, the Royal Air Force came to this part of the world and set up RAF Credenhill.  This was not an airfield: for the next 45 years the RAF used this site for a number of training schools.  In 1994 the RAF moved out and the Army subsequently moved in: since 1999 Credenhill has been the home of the 22nd Special Air Service Regiment, the British Army's main special forces unit.  SAS RHQ was renamed in 2000 as Stirling Lines, after the regiment's founder Sir David Stirling.

Soldiers generally don't vote in local elections, and soldiers from a unit as secretive as the SAS would have even less incentive to vote or indeed to register to vote.  So we may well see here a continuation of the recent trend of very low turnouts in local by-elections.

On the other hand, there is an argument the other way that this by-election might be closely fought, because it marks a new chapter in Credenhill's elections.  It's to replace veteran independent councillor Bob Matthews, who had represented this ward since the creation of the modern Herefordshire council in 1998.  Matthews, who died in June at the age of 87, was the leader of the True Independents group on the council.

Bob Matthews was last re-elected in 2023, a year in which independents lost ground in Herefordshire and the Conservatives took minority control against the national trend: the 2023 Herefordshire elections returned 21 Conservative councillors, 12 Lib Dems, 9 Greens, 8 independents, 2 councillors from the localist group It's Our County, and 1 Labour councillor.  In Credenhill ward Matthews won his final term with 38% of the vote against 34% for the Conservatives and 15% for the Lib Dems.  Credenhill ward is included within the North Herefordshire parliamentary seat, which was one of the three seats gained by the Green Party in July's general election; however, the Greens are not standing in this by-election.

Two independent candidates have come forward to succeed Bob Matthews.  Charlie Taylor contested this ward last year, finishing in fourth and last place with 13%, and she is supported by the council's main independent group; Mike Jones stood in the most Herefordshire council by-election last October, polling 3.8% and tying for third place in Golden Valley South ward.  (That poll was won by Matthew Engel, the former <em>Wisden</em> editor.)  The Conservatives' Gareth Johnston is back after his close second place in Credenhill last year; he is the deputy chair (political) of the party's North Herefordshire branch.  Standing for the Lib Dems is Debbie Hobbs, who represents the neighbouring Kings Acre ward on the parish-level Hereford city council.  Completing the Credenhill ballot are Mike Crofts for Labour and Brian Evans for Reform UK.

<h2>Barnfield; and<br>
Wigmore</h2>

Luton council, Bedfordshire; caused respectively by the resignations of Liberal Democrat councillors Jeff Petts and Claire Gallagher.

We finish for the month in Luton, which has long been a rare stronghold for the Labour party in the East of England.  Both of Luton's parliamentary seats have been in Labour hands continuously since the Blair landslide of 1997, with the exception of a period in the 2017-19 Parliament when Luton North MP Kelvin Hopkins was suspended over sexual misconduct allegations while South MP Gavin Shuker ended up in Change UK, or whatever it was they called that week.  Shuker stood for re-election and lost badly in 2019 while Kelvin Hopkins retired, so Luton had a clearout of its MPs that year: Kelvin Hopkins' daughter Rachel won South, while North was won by Sarah Owen, the first femals MP of Chinese descent.

Sarah Owen and Rachel Hopkins remain on the backbenches, having been re-elected in July comfortably enough against split opposition.  Both Luton constituencies saw saved deposits for Labour, the Conservatives, Reform UK, a left-wing Muslim independent, the Workers Party and the Greens.

The Liberal Democrats finished in seventh place in both Luton constituencies, polling 6% in Luton South and South Bedfordshire and being just 48 votes away from saving their deposit in Luton North.  However, it's a different story in local elections where the Liberal Democrats are the main opposition to the Labour majority on Luton council.

Today the Liberal Democrats have to defend two by-elections to replace Jeff Petts and Claire Gallagher, who are both leaving the council to spend more time with their families.  Petts wants to do some travelling "while my wife and I are still fit enough to enjoy it", while Gallagher has found herself unable to properly devote time to both her young family and her democratic duties.

Jeff Petts is a long-serving councillor who was first elected in 2015 for the town's Icknield ward as a Conservative; he defected to the Lib Dems in 2021, and when Icknield ward disappeared in boundary changes for the 2023 election he transferred to Barnfield ward.  This area is north of Luton town centre along the A6 towards Bedford, and it is centred on Luton Sixth Form College which has educated personalities including the <em>James Bond</em> composer David Arnold, the <em>Bake Off</em> winner Nadiya Hussain, and (er) Andrew Tate.  Two current Labour MPs were also educated at Luton Sixth Form College, Kerry McCarthy and Rachel Hopkins.  The present Barnfield ward has a large population who are Muslim and/or of Asian heritage.

Wigmore ward covers privately-developed 1970s housing at the eastern end of Luton's built-up area together with the terminal, apron and runways of Luton Airport.  The airport and its associated industries dominate the ward's economy: easyjet and TUI Airways both have their head offices in Wigmore ward.  The airport itself is owned by Luton council which previously funded a number of services from its dividend - until the Covid-19 pandemic led to the airport's dividend disappearing virtually overnight, forcing the council to seek a massive bailout from central government.  Luton is the UK's fifth-busiest airport after Heathrow, Gatwick, Manchester and Stansted: in 2023 it handled 16.4 million passengers - down from 18.2 million in 2019 - with its busiest route being to Bucharest.

Both Barnfield and Wigmore were safe Lib Dem wards at the last Luton council elections in 2023.  Wigmore ward voted a massive 83% Lib Dem in a straight fight with Labour.  Claire Gallagher was first elected here in that year.  Barnfield ward is more competitive, and Rachel Hopkins MP was a Labour councillor here from 2011 to 2019 before moving to a safer ward.  In 2023 Barnfield returned the Lib Dem slate by 52-36 over Labour.

In Wigmore the defending Liberal Democrat candidate is Adrees Latif, who was born in Azad Kashmir and came to the UK at the age of eight.  From 2001 to 2018 Latif was the subpostmaster at Caddington post office to the south-west of Luton, and he was one of the key witnesses in the case of <em>Bates v Post Office</em> whose evidence persuaded the Court that the Post Office's Horizon computer system wasn't working properly.  Latif was an unsuccessful candidate for Luton council last year in a different ward but should have better luck this time.  He's up against Farid Ahmed for Labour, independent candidate Carolyn Cottier who stood here in 2019 on the ticket of the now-defunct "Best for Luton Party", Elissa Gordon for the Greens and Philip Turner for the Conservatives.

There is also a five-candidate ballot in Barnfield which is defended for the Lib Dems by Anwar Malik, who is a self-employed accountant and financial advisor.  Labour's Karen Roy is currently training to teach English.  Also standing are Ash Ali for the Conservatives, Edward Carpenter for the Green Party and former Green figure Marc Scheimann as an independent.
