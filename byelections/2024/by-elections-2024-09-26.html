Nine by-elections, for ten seats, on 26th September 2024:

<h2>Cromarty Firth; and<br>
Inverness Central</h2>

Highland council, Scotland.  The Cromarty Firth poll is a double by-election caused by the resignations of independent councillor Pauline Munro and Liberal Democrat councillor Molly Nolan.  The Inverness Central by-election is caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Bet McAllister.

In contrast to the succession of urban English wards which this column covered last week, half of the council seats up for election today are in the Scottish Highlands in wards linked together by the A9 road.  There are currently four vacant seats on the far-flung Highland council, and three of them will be filled today; we will back in the Highlands next month for the remaining seat in Fort William and Ardnamurchan.

Today's two Highland council by-elections are very different in character.  We'll start with the rural one in Cromarty Firth ward, which covers the north bank of that firth.  The ward boundaries include a large mountainous area, but the population here is concentrated on the coastal strip in the towns of Alness and Invergordon.  These are surprisingly industrial places.  Alness boomed in population after the Second World War with the building of an aluminium smelter in the area; this closed in the 1980s and whisky is now the town's major export.  Invergordon was a naval base for many years, and its port is now kept busy servicing the North Sea oil and gas industry: oil and gas rigs are constructed here, floated out to their intended location, and then brought back and parked here at the end of their lives to await decommissioning.  The later process is not always a smooth one, and the sheltered waters of the Cromarty Firth are littered with unloved oil rigs waiting for something to happen to them.

All this attracts bored people on the internet doing what bored people on the internet do.  The abandoned oil rigs have become a favoured target for YouTubers who should have looked at their dilapidated condition and known better than to start exploring them.  Behind the old naval base we have the underground Inchindown oil tanks, which are now drained of their fuel oil; experiments have shown that the resulting empty space has the world's longest reverberation.

And it's not just YouTubers who have had their fun in Cromarty Firth ward.  In the ward's interior we have Ardross Castle, once owned by the Dukes of Sutherland and now used for weddings and conferences.  It's also the filming location for the hit BBC reality TV series <em>The Traitors</em>.  For brass and wind band players, Ardross Castle was known before <em>The Traitors</em> as the opening movement of Philip Sparke's suite <em>Hymn of the Highlands</em>.

Alness and Invergordon are both on the Far North railway line, with several trains per day to the major city in the Highland council area.  Inverness Central ward is the most compact ward in the UK's most far-flung council: the city centre, the castle and the railway station are all here, together with the South Kessock and Merkinch areas between the river and the Caledonian Canal.  Inverness has an unusual distinction for the UK government, in that the first cabinet meeting held outside London took place here: David Lloyd George, who was on holiday in the Highlands at the time, convened a Cabinet in the Inverness Town House in 1921 to discuss the Irish situation.

The city of Inverness is strongly growing in population, but the population growth is taking place on the outskirts; boundary changes for the 2017 election to reflect this reduced Inverness Central ward from four seats to three.  All four outgoing councillors stood for re-election, so somebody was going to miss out.  In the event, the one who missed out was Donnie Kerr, who sought re-election as an independent candidate: he polled 11% of the vote and was eliminated in fifth place.  The SNP's Richard Laird topped the poll with 33% and was elected on the first count; second and third were Bet McAllister for Labour (17%) and independent Janet Campbell (15%), who pulled away from the Conservatives' Donald Mackenzie (12%) to win the final two seats comfortably.

Richard Laird resigned from the council on health grounds in 2019, and the SNP won the resulting by-election very comfortably, polling 45% of the first preferences and getting over the required 50% with the Conservatives, an independent and the Lib Dems still in the count.  Encouraged by this performance, the Nationalists went for two seats here in the 2022 Highland council elections and got them.  Shares of the vote here in 2022 were 41% for the SNP, 24% for Labour and 13% for the Conservatives, with the three seats splitting 2 to the SNP and 1 to Labour; the SNP picked up the seat previously held by retiring independent councillor Janet Campbell.

Cromarty Firth ward has returned four Highland councillors since its creation in 2007.  Its first two elections both returned two independent councillors and one each for the SNP and the Lib Dems; the Lib Dems lost their seat to the SNP in 2017, but got it back in 2022.  Shares of the vote here in 2022 were 29% for the SNP's Tamala Collier, 28% for the Lib Dems' Molly Nolan and 18% for previous SNP councillor Pauline Munro, who was successfully re-elected as an independent candidate.  They won the first three seats.

In the race for the final seat nobody had very much to begin with, with the other outgoing previous SNP councillor Maxine Morley-Smith also standing as an independent and starting in fourth place on 283 votes to 261 for the Conservatives; she pulled away during the count to win by 575 votes to 397 to give Cromarty Firth a clean sweep of female councillors.  Morley-Smith was rather lucky to be re-elected.  If the Lib Dems had had two candidates they would have picked up the Conservative transfers and won two seats, while if the SNP had had two candidates the final seat would have been too close to call between their second candidate and Morley-Smith.

The Lib Dems and the SNP represent this area in the two Parliaments, which both have a constituency of varying names based on Caithness, Sutherland and this part of Ross-shire.  The local MP since 2017 has been Jamie Stone, who was elected unopposed earlier this month as chair of the Commons petitions committee.  Cromarty Firth's representative in the Scottish Parliament is Maree Todd, an SNP frontbencher with the social care, mental wellbeing and sport portfolios.  The Highland council as a whole is run by an SNP-Independent coalition.

Today's Cromarty Firth poll is a rare double by-election because two councillors have resigned at the same time for undisclosed reasons.  The Lib Dems' Molly Nolan was in her first term on the council, while Pauline Munro was first elected in 2017 for the SNP and was re-elected in 2022 as an independent candidate.  Candidates here will need to poll one-third of the votes to win a seat, either on first preferences or by attracting transfers.  If we rerun the 2022 count for two seats then the count ends with 37% for the Lib Dems, 34% for the SNP and 29% for Munro, so the SNP should probably be looking to gain a seat here.

Today's other Highland council by-election follows the retirement of long-serving councillor Bet McAllister, who had been the Labour representative for Inverness Central ward since its creation in 2007.  Following the death last year of her husband Bill, who sat on the old Inverness council from 1977 to its abolition in 1996, Bet wants to spend more time with her grandchildren.  Rerunning the 2022 votes here for one seat gives 53% to the SNP and 47% to Labour, so Labour will need to improve their position to hold this by-election.

The defending Labour candidate for Inverness Central is Michael Gregson, who is seeking to return to local government after a long time away: he was previously an Inverness councillor from 1992 to 1996.  Standing for the Scottish National Party is Martin Macgregor, who is a senior union representative at Royal Mail.  The Conservatives have reselected Donald Mackenzie, who was runner-up here in the 2017 and 2022 ordinary elections.  Completing an all-male ballot paper are Andrew Barnett for the Greens, Chris Lewcock for the Lib Dems and Iain Richmond for Reform UK.

There is a lot of interest in the Cromarty Firth by-election with twelve candidates standing for the two available seats.  The Lib Dems have selected John Edmondson, who is the secretary of Ardross community council.  No fewer than five independent candidates are standing to succeed Pauline Munro.  Of those Martin Rattray was a Lib Dem councillor for this ward from 2007 to 2017, lost re-election then as an independent, stood for the Lib Dems in Inverness Central in 2022, and is now an independent here again; Tina McCaffery contested this ward as an independent candidate in 2012, polling 9.2%; Sinclair Coghill is vice-chair of Saltburn and Westwood community council; Richard Cross has lived in Invergordon for over 50 years; while Brideen Godley-Mackenzie hasn't let her recent hearing loss put her off standing for election.  The SNP have selected Odette Macdonald, who is a caseworker for the party's local MSP Maree Todd.  Innes Munro stands for the Conservatives, Michael Perera for Labour, Ryan Barrowman is the Green candidate, and Reform UK are ambitiously going for both seats with their candidates Kim and Roland Hanning Jackson.

<h2>Perth City North; and<br>
Strathallan</h2>

Perth and Kinross council, Scotland; caused respectively by the resignations of Labour councillor Brian Leishman and Conservative councillor Crawford Reid.

We now travel south along the A9 for our other two by-elections in the Scottish Highlands, although we are now outside the Highland council area.  Instead we have come to the Fair City of Perth, the gateway to the Highlands and the northern end of the UK's motorway network.

Perth has been a major city since the 12th century when King William the Lion gave it the status of a Royal Burgh.  The city benefited from its location at the head of the Tay estuary and its closeness to Scone Abbey, one of the centres of the Scottish monarchy, to become a major port trading with continental Europe.  Industry came in the eighteenth century, and in the Victorian era Perth developed into a major railway junction where main lines to Dundee, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Inverness all met.  Today there is a diverse economy with a significant financial services presence: the largest employers are the local council and the bus company Stagecoach, which is based here, and the city (formally re-created as such for Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee in 2012) is a major service centre for the local area.

For electoral purposes the city is divided into three wards: the City Centre ward east of the railway lines, and the City North and City South wards to the west.  These wards were originally drawn up for the 2007 elections to Perth and Kinross council when they returned four councillors each.  Slight boundary changes for the 2017 election saw the North ward go down from four seats to three.

The main A9 road turns right at the Broxburn Roundabout west of Perth and heads up the valley of Strathallan towards Dunblane, Stirling and the Lowlands.  The Perth and Kinross ward of Strathallan is based on the town of Auchterarder, known as the Lang Toun because its high street is well over a mile long, and takes in a number of scattered villages in the area.

Auchterarder is the nearest town to the Gleneagles Hotel, which celebrates its centenary this year.  The hotel was opened in 1924 by the Caledonian Railway, and originally had its own dedicated branch line.  In politics, Gleneagles was the venue for the 2005 G8 summit and the 1977 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, which concluded the Gleneagles Agreement on the sporting boycott of apartheid South Africa.  Gleneagles has three tournament-standard golf courses and hosted the 2014 Ryder Cup, in which Europe beat the USA 16½-11½.  In 1981 a world record was set here as Terry Wogan - yes, <em>that</em> Terry Wogan - tapped in from 100 feet in what was then the longest golf putt ever televised.

Perth and Kinross council is run by the Scottish National Party, who have a minority administration.  The city of Perth itself has been represented at Westminster by the SNP continuously since a 1995 by-election, which is the party's longest streak of representation anywhere.  This year's boundary changes created a new seat of Perth and Kinross-shire which was won by Pete Wishart, who has been in the Commons since 2001 and is the second longest-serving SNP MP after A**x S*****d.  Before entering politics Wishart played keyboards in the bands Runrig and Big Country; in the Commons he was a co-founder of the band MP4 alongside three other then-MPs from Labour and the Conservatives.  The SNP collapse in July's Westminster election meant that Wishart lost his position as chair of the Scottish Affairs select committee; he has instead become deputy leader of the Westminster group.

The SNP also hold the Holyrood seat of Perthshire South and Kinross-shire which covers both Perthshire wards up for election today: the MSP since 2021 has been Jim Fairlie, who is on the party's frontbench as minister for agriculture and connectivity.  However, the 2024 Westminster boundary changes transferred most of Strathallan ward into the Stirling parliamentary seat which was renamed as "Stirling and Strathallan": this was a very surprising Labour gain in July for Chris Kane, the leader of Stirling council.

Labour achieved this despite the fact that they didn't even contest Strathallan ward in the 2022 Perth and Kinross council elections.  The ward has three councillors, and since 2017 they have gone two to the Conservatives and one to the SNP.  First preferences here in 2022 were 47% for the Conservatives and 35% for the SNP, and rerunning the count for a single vacancy gives a 55-45 Conservative lead after transfers.  Conservative councillor Crawford Reid, who has represented the ward since 2017, is standing down from the council because he is going back to working for the NHS as a consultant anaesthetist.

The urban Perth City North ward is a much more left-wing area, and when it was first created in 2007 its four seats split evenly between Labour and the SNP.  The 2017 boundary changes removed one councillor and some of the ward's best areas for Labour, and in that year Labour crashed out of Perth's council representation.  North ward returned two SNP councillors and one Conservative, on vote shares of 49% for the SNP, 26% for the Conservatives and 16% for Labour.

In the December 2019 general election SNP ward councillor Dave Doogan was elected as MP for Angus (a seat which he still holds under a different name), and he subsequently stepped down from the council.  The resulting by-election was delayed to November 2020 by the pandemic, and the SNP held their seat in the first round with a 61-23 lead over the Conservatives.

In the 2022 ordinary election the SNP again polled an absolute majority of the first preferences, with a 55-20 lead over the Conservatives.  Five years earlier the ward's Conservative councillor had polled 26% and been elected on the first count; but this time the Tory candidate Aziz Rehman was short of the 25% quota and would need to rely on transfers.  This did not go well for him.  Labour's Brian Leishman started in fourth place, 147 votes behind Rehman, and his 15% score was actually slightly worse than the party had polled in 2017.  However, Leishman gained votes on Rehman at every stage of the count: Leishman finally pulled ahead on the fifth and final count after transfers from the Greens, to win the final seat by 735 votes to 733.

Brian Leishman's day job was as a golfing professional.  He had been on the team at Gleneagles which worked on the 2014 Ryder Cup, and by 2022 he was working at Alloa Golf Club.  This was the scene of his biggest victory yet: in the July 2024 general election Leishman became the MP for the new seat of Alloa and Grangemouth, winning with a large majority over the SNP.  Leishman defeated not one but two outgoing MPs, John Nicolson (previously the SNP MP for Ochil and South Perthshire) and Kenny MacAskill (previously Alba MP for East Lothian, who finished in eighth place and came nowhere near saving his deposit).

Like Dave Doogan before him, Brian Leishman has stood down from Perth City North ward upon his election to Wesstminster.  This creates an extremely difficult by-election for Labour to defend.  If we rerun the 2022 votes for a single vacancy, then the final count is between the ward's two SNP candidates with Ian Massie defeating John Rebbeck by 1381 votes to 966.  On a two-party preferred basis the SNP led the Conservatives 72-28 and Labour 66-34 in Perth City North.  To have any chance of holding their seat - and they need to hold this seat to keep group status on Perth and Kinross council - Labour would need to get ahead of the Conservatives and hope to rely on Unionist transfers.

Perhaps this explains why Labour have sent in the big guns for this by-election campaign: the Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarawr was in Perth recently to support defending candidate Kirsten Nkwocha-Dyer, who works in an administrative role at a local foodbank.  The SNP candidate is Carol Mair who appears to be fighting her first election campaign.  Aziz Rehman is back for the Conservatives after standing in the 2022 ordinary election and the 2020 by-election; he runs takeaways in Perth and Aberfeldy and he is vice-chairman of the Perth Welfare Society.  Also standing are Tina Ng-A-Mann for the Lib Dems, Caitlin Ripley for the Greens, Robert Reid for Alba and Sonia Davidson for Reform UK.

All of those parties except Alba are also on the Strathallan ballot paper.  Here the defending Conservative candidate is Amanda Runciman.  The Scottish National Party have reselected Catherine Scott, who was their second candidate here last year and finished as runner-up.  Completing the candidate list for Strathallan are Alan Watt for the Lib Dems, Nettie Sutherland for the Greens, Ken McCracken for Labour and Ian Thomas for Reform UK.  As usual, the Scottish reminders apply to these vacancies and also to the Highland council by-elections above: Votes at 16 apply, and please rank the candidates on your ballot paper in order of preference.

<h2>Rhyl Trellewelyn</h2>

Denbighshire council, North Wales; caused by the death of Labour councillor Win Mullen-James.

For our Welsh by-election today we have come to sunny Rhyl, a resort on the north coast which gets a bit of a bad press.  Most of the seaside resorts in North Wales were built to serve the tastes of the British holidaymaker as they were a century ago.  If we look at the towns of Llandudno and Colwyn Bay to the west we see a rather dramatic landscape for those who don't want to sunbathe on the beaches; Rhyl doesn't have that advantage, as it lies on flat ground close to the mouth of the River Clwyd. Socially, it's quite a step down from Llandudno in particular.

Rhyl is the largest town with the Denbighshire council area, which is run by a Labour-Plaid coalition following the 2022 elections.  In that year Labour won 19 out of 48 seats and became the largest party despite the fact that they actually finished third in vote terms behind independent candidates and the Conservatives; this is partly explained by the fact that Labour contested very few wards outside Rhyl and Prestatyn.  The party's total is now down to fifteen as a result of a by-election loss to the Conservatives last year, a defection loss and two seats being vacant.

One of those vacancies is a result of the general election in July, where Labour councillor Gill German was elected as the Labour MP for the new seat of Clwyd North.  This is a relatively urban seat by North Welsh standards, combining the towns of Colwyn Bay, Abergele and Rhyl on the coast with St Asaph and Denbigh in the interior.  German won her seat narrowly in July, defeating the Conservative candidate Darren Millar - the current MS for Clwyd West - by 1,196 votes.  She has resigned her Denbighshire council seat, and this column will be in Prestatyn in a month's time to cover the resulting by-election.  In Senedd elections Rhyl is part of the Vale of Clwyd constituency, which was gained by the Conservatives in 2021; local MS James Davies also sought election to Westminster in July, but he was defeated in the Clwyd East seat.

The by-election loss referred to above came in February last year in Rhyl Tŷ Newydd ward, which was created by boundary changes in 2022.  Denbighshire council gained a councillor as a result of that review, and this was achieved by splitting the former three-seat ward of Rhyl South East into a pair of two-seat wards called Rhyl Tŷ Newydd and Rhyl Trellewelyn.  Trellewelyn ward is the south-east corner of Rhyl's built-up area, and it is located to the south of the road towards Dyserth.  The old Rhyl South East was marginal between Labour and the Conservatives, but Trellewelyn's first election in 2022 saw the Tories fall to third place: Labour polled 40%, an independent candidate had 30% and the Conservatives scored 18%.

This by-election has been pending for quite some time following the death of Win Mullen-James in May at the age of 79.  Mullen-James had served twice as mayor of Rhyl, and she was first elected to Denbighshire council as a Labour candidate for Rhyl South East in 2012; she lost re-election as an independent candidate in 2017, but by 2022 she was back in the Labour fold.

Defending the Rhyl Trellewelyn by-election for Labour is Mike Blackwell, who was elected to Rhyl town council in a by-election last year.  This time there is no independent candidate standing so Blackwell's main challenge may come from the Conservative candidate Will Price.  Also standing are Bleddyn Rhys for Plaid Cymru and Andrew Morris for the Lib Dems.

<h2>Credenhill</h2>

Herefordshire council; caused by the death of independent councillor Bob Matthews.

We now finally arrive in England within the beautiful Welsh Marches.  Although there's more industry here than you might think, and the village of Credenhill a few miles to the north-west of Hereford gave us a well-known brand.  In 1887 the rector of Credenhill was called Charles Bulmer; his 20-year-old son Percy decided to go into business and founded a cider-making company, originally with apples from the rectory gardens.  H P Bulmer Ltd became the world's largest producer of cider and still sources much of its apples from Herefordshire: it's now owned by Heineken, and the Bulmers and Strongbow brands still account for over half of the UK's cider production.

A couple of centuries earlier the rector of Credenhill was Thomas Traherne, who served the parish from 1657 to 1667 during the turbulent times of the Restoration.  Today Traherne is remembered as a holy man by the Church of England, which commemorates him on 10th October, and for his poetry and theological writings which attracted little attention in his lifetime or for centuries afterwards: his best-known work, <em>Centuries of Meditations</em>, was not published until 1908.  Once Thomas Traherne's writings were rediscovered they inspired a number of composers in the UK and abroad: see, for example, Gerald Finzi's cantata <em>Dies Natalis</em> which set four of Traherne's texts to music.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t14ZJAgH1k

During the Second World War, the Royal Air Force came to this part of the world and set up RAF Credenhill.  This was not an airfield: for the next 45 years the RAF used this site for a number of training schools.  In 1994 the RAF moved out and the Army subsequently moved in: since 1999 Credenhill has been the home of the 22nd Special Air Service Regiment, the British Army's main special forces unit.  SAS RHQ was renamed in 2000 as Stirling Lines, after the regiment's founder Sir David Stirling.

Soldiers generally don't vote in local elections, and soldiers from a unit as secretive as the SAS would have even less incentive to vote or indeed to register to vote.  So we may well see here a continuation of the recent trend of very low turnouts in local by-elections.

On the other hand, there is an argument the other way that this by-election might be closely fought, because it marks a new chapter in Credenhill's elections.  It's to replace veteran independent councillor Bob Matthews, who had represented this ward since the creation of the modern Herefordshire council in 1998.  Matthews, who died in June at the age of 87, was the leader of the True Independents group on the council.

Bob Matthews was last re-elected in 2023, a year in which independents lost ground in Herefordshire and the Conservatives took minority control against the national trend: the 2023 Herefordshire elections returned 21 Conservative councillors, 12 Lib Dems, 9 Greens, 8 independents, 2 councillors from the localist group It's Our County, and 1 Labour councillor.  In Credenhill ward Matthews won his final term with 38% of the vote against 34% for the Conservatives and 15% for the Lib Dems.  Credenhill ward is included within the North Herefordshire parliamentary seat, which was one of the three seats gained by the Green Party in July's general election; however, the Greens are not standing in this by-election.

Two independent candidates have come forward to succeed Bob Matthews.  Charlie Taylor contested this ward last year, finishing in fourth and last place with 13%, and she is supported by the council's main independent group; Mike Jones stood in the most Herefordshire council by-election last October, polling 3.8% and tying for third place in Golden Valley South ward.  (That poll was won by Matthew Engel, the former <em>Wisden</em> editor.)  The Conservatives' Gareth Johnston is back after his close second place in Credenhill last year; he is the deputy chair (political) of the party's North Herefordshire branch.  Standing for the Lib Dems is Debbie Hobbs, who represents the neighbouring Kings Acre ward on the parish-level Hereford city council.  Completing the Credenhill ballot are Mike Crofts for Labour and Brian Evans for Reform UK.

<h2>Stretton</h2>

East Staffordshire council; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Mike Ackroyd.

It's time to travel over into the English Midlands as we travel to Burton-on-Trent.  Or, more accurately, to one of its northern suburbs.  The name of Stretton refers to the Roman road of Ryknild Street, which runs along the north bank of the River Trent between Lichfield and Derby.  Much of Ryknild Stret remains in use today as the A38 trunk road, but the modern dual carriageway deviates to the west to bypass Burton town centre.

The village of Stretton marks both the northern end of the Burton bypass and the northern end of Burton's built-up area, although it was never part of the old Burton upon Trent county borough.  Despite that some of Burton's industry has spilled over into Stretton parish, notably the large Pirelli factory which has been making tyres here for almost a century.  Stretton's housing stock is mostly postwar and has high levels of owner-occupation.

Burton upon Trent was in the unusual situation that it was a county borough but never a parliamentary borough, which was due to the town's rather small population: at the 1970s reorganisation Burton was the second-smallest county borough in England by headcount, after Canterbury.  The Burton parliamentary seat has always been a county division of Staffordshire with boundaries that include the town of Uttoxeter to the west, and because of that Burton tends to have a Labour MP only in landslide years.  In July the newly-renamed seat of Burton and Uttoxeter was gained for Labour by Jacob Collier, who grew up in Stretton and came to the Commons from the Nottinghamshire fire and rescue service.  He defeated one-term Tory MP Kate Kniveton, who took the seat over in 2019 from her abusive ex-husband Andrew Griffiths.

The Burton and Uttoxeter parliamentary seat has similar boundaries to the East Staffordshire local government district, where Labour won an overall majority in the 2023 council elections to end eight years of Conservative rule.  Stretton ward tends to be safely Conservative, but their brand was damaged a bit here by two by-elections in September 2017 and February 2018: the second one came after Dale Spedding, the the winner of the first by-election, resigned after two months citing harassment from his constituents.  Independent candidate Graham Lamb finished as a close runner-up in the 2018 by-election, and he went on to gain one of the ward's three seats from the Conservatives in 2019.  He retired in 2023 and his seat was gained by Labour.  Shares of the vote in Stretton ward last year were 46% for the Conservatives (which was inflated by a significant personal vote for their candidate Liz Bullock), 31% for Labour, and 23% for a new independent candidate called - in a nice bit of nominative determinism - Tracey Stretton.  The Conservatives also hold the Horninglow and Stretton division of Staffordshire county council, which covers most of this ward.

This by-election is to replace Conservative councillor Mike Ackroyd, who passed away in June at the age of 72.  Ackroyd had been chairman of Branston parish council since 2011, and he was in his first term on East Staffordshire council.  In his working life he had spent 45 years as a sales engineer in the water and sewage industry.

The Conservatives and Labour have both selected Stretton parish councillors to fight this by-election.  Defending for the Tories is Gerry Holmes.  Labour have selected John McKiernan, who served for ten years as chair of the parish council and is hoping to join his wife Shelagh on the borough council.  There is no independent candidate this time, but we do have three candidates thanks to the nomination of Kelly Rickard for the Green Party.

<h2>Barnfield; and<br>
Wigmore</h2>

Luton council, Bedfordshire; caused respectively by the resignations of Liberal Democrat councillors Jeff Petts and Claire Gallagher.

We finish for the month in Luton, which has long been a rare stronghold for the Labour party in the East of England.  Both of Luton's parliamentary seats have been in Labour hands continuously since the Blair landslide of 1997, with the exception of a period in the 2017-19 Parliament when Luton North MP Kelvin Hopkins was suspended over sexual misconduct allegations while South MP Gavin Shuker ended up in Change UK, or the Independent Group, or whatever it was they were called that week.  Shuker stood for re-election in 2019 and lost badly while Kelvin Hopkins retired, so Luton had a clearout of its MPs that year: Kelvin Hopkins' daughter Rachel won South, while North was won by Sarah Owen, the first femals MP of Chinese descent.

Sarah Owen and Rachel Hopkins remain on the backbenches, having been re-elected in July comfortably enough against split opposition.  Both Luton constituencies saw saved deposits for Labour, the Conservatives, Reform UK, a left-wing Muslim independent, the Workers Party and the Greens.

The Liberal Democrats finished in seventh place in both Luton constituencies, polling 6% in Luton South and South Bedfordshire and being just 48 votes away from saving their deposit in Luton North.  However, it's a different story in local elections where the Liberal Democrats are the main opposition to the Labour majority on Luton council.

Today the Liberal Democrats have to defend two by-elections to replace Jeff Petts and Claire Gallagher, who are both leaving the council to spend more time with their families.  Petts wants to do some travelling "while my wife and I are still fit enough to enjoy it", while Gallagher has found herself unable to properly devote time to both her young family and her democratic duties.

Jeff Petts is a long-serving councillor who was first elected in 2015 for the town's Icknield ward as a Conservative; he defected to the Lib Dems in 2021, and when Icknield ward disappeared in boundary changes for the 2023 election he transferred to Barnfield ward.  This area is north of Luton town centre along the A6 towards Bedford, and it is centred on Luton Sixth Form College which has educated personalities including the <em>James Bond</em> composer David Arnold, the <em>Bake Off</em> winner Nadiya Hussain, and (er) Andrew Tate.  Two current Labour MPs were also educated at Luton Sixth Form College, Kerry McCarthy and Rachel Hopkins.  The present Barnfield ward has a large population who are Muslim and/or of Asian heritage.

Wigmore ward covers privately-developed 1970s housing at the eastern end of Luton's built-up area together with the terminal, apron and runways of Luton Airport.  The airport and its associated industries dominate the ward's economy: easyjet and TUI Airways both have their head offices in Wigmore ward.  The airport itself is owned by Luton council which previously funded a number of services from its dividend - until the Covid-19 pandemic led to the airport's dividend disappearing virtually overnight, forcing the council to seek a massive bailout from central government.  Luton is the UK's fifth-busiest airport after Heathrow, Gatwick, Manchester and Stansted: in 2023 it handled 16.4 million passengers - down from 18.2 million in 2019 - with its busiest route being to Bucharest.

Both Barnfield and Wigmore were safe Lib Dem wards at the last Luton council elections in 2023.  Wigmore ward voted a massive 83% Lib Dem in a straight fight with Labour.  Claire Gallagher was first elected here in that year.  Barnfield ward is more competitive, and Rachel Hopkins MP was a Labour councillor here from 2011 to 2019 before moving to a safer ward.  In 2023 Barnfield returned the Lib Dem slate by 52-36 over Labour.

In Wigmore the defending Liberal Democrat candidate is Adrees Latif, who was born in Azad Kashmir and came to the UK at the age of eight.  From 2001 to 2018 Latif was the subpostmaster at Caddington post office to the south-west of Luton, and he was one of the key witnesses in the case of <em>Bates v Post Office</em> whose evidence persuaded the Court that the Post Office's Horizon computer system wasn't working properly.  Latif was an unsuccessful candidate for Luton council last year in a different ward but should have better luck this time.  He's up against Farid Ahmed for Labour, independent candidate Carolyn Cottier who stood here in 2019 on the ticket of the now-defunct "Best for Luton Party", Elissa Gordon for the Greens and Philip Turner for the Conservatives.

There is also a five-candidate ballot in Barnfield which is defended for the Lib Dems by Anwar Malik, who is a self-employed accountant and financial advisor.  Labour's Karen Roy is currently training to teach English.  Also standing are Ash Ali for the Conservatives, Edward Carpenter for the Green Party and former Green figure Marc Scheimann as an independent.
