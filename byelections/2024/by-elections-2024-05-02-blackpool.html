<h2>Lancashire</h2>

<h3>Police and Crime Commissioner</h3>

The Blackpool South by-election is combined with the county-wide poll for Lancashire police and crime commissioner.  This is one of the most marginal police areas, with the Conservatives gaining the PCC post last year from Labour by 45-42.

<h3>Local elections</h3>

There are elections this year for the whole of Rossendale council on new ward boundaries, and for one-third of the councillors in Blackburn with Darwen, Burrnley, Chorley, Hyndburn, Pendle, Preston and West Lancashire.

To get one thing out of the way first, East Lancashire is the part of the country where the war in Gaza has had its biggest effect on the Labour party.  The national media did note Azhar Ali, the Lancashire county councillor for Nelson East who was disendorsed as the Labour candidate in the Rochdale parliamentary by-election two months ago for antisemitism.  What you might not have heard about is the massive split in Burrnley Labour in November 2023, or the entire Labour council group in Pendle walking out of the party just a week before the nomination deadline for these local elections.  In Pendle, nine of the ten ex-Labour councillors are Muslim.  In both cases the defectors include the council leadership, and the Labour-Lib Dem coalition in Pendle and the Labour-led traffic-light coalition in Burrnley have both continued with "independent" substituted for "Labour".

Which makes this year's elections in Burrnley and Pendle even more unpredictable than usual.  <b>Pendle</b> council currently stands at 13 Conservatives plus a vacancy, 10 ex-Labour independents, 7 Lib Dems and 2 other independents.  Five of the ex-Labour councillors are up for election this year (including one who had previously defected from the Conservatives), and all five of them are seeking re-election as independent candidates, two of them without official Labour opposition; the council leader Asjad Mahmood actually put nomination papers in as an official Labour candidate before withdrawing them and filling out a new nomination form as an independent.  The par score would see the Lib Dems gain two seats from the Conservatives, but really it's anybody's guess what will happen here.

In Burrnley there is a coalition in place of 11 ex-Labour councillors in the "Burrnley Independent Group", 7 Lib Dems and 7 Greens; in opposition is the rump Labour group of 11, 8 Conservatives and a non-aligned councillor.  Four of the ex-Labour councillors are up for election this year, with three seeking re-election as independent councillors (in Bank Hall, Daneshouse with Stoneyholme and Lanehead wards) and the other retiring.  The par score, such as it is, would see Labour lose Brunshaw to the Green Party but gain Gawthorpe from the Conservatives, while there is also an open seat up for grabs in Gannow ward following the recent winding-up of the Burrnley and Padiham Independent Party.

The meeting at which Azhar Ali made his fateful remarks took place in <b>Hyndburn</b>, where the massive Labour split was underway well before the war in Gaza.  Following the 2023 elections Hyndburn council stood at 16 councillors each for the Conservatives and Labour with two Greens and an independent councillor holding the balance of power; despite or perhaps because of the fact that both Green councillors were originally elected on the Labour ticket, they installed a Conservative minority administration.  Both Labour to Green defectors (in Barnfield and Peel wards) are retiring this year; if Labour can get those seats back and repeat the 2022-23 results elsewhere they will gain overall control.

The other Lancashire councils up for election are much more placid.  The tiny <b>Rossendale</b> district, tucked away at the head of the Irwell valley, is all-up this year with new ward boundaries coming in; the outgoing council has 21 Labour councillors against 9 Conservatives, 2 Community First, 2 independents, 1 Green and 1 vacant seat.  This is one of those councils where when one party wins they tend to win big; good Labour performances here last year suggest that their majority is not under serious threat this time round.

<b>West Lancashire</b> got new ward boundaries last year, with the all-out 2023 election returning 26 Labour councillors against 15 Conservatives and four seats for Our West Lancashire.  By contrast to Rossendale this is a council with very few marginal wards; the only ward with split representation is Burscough Town, which the OWLs will be defending from Labour.

The Labour majorities in <b>Preston</b> and <b>Blackburn with Darwen</b> are not under serious threat and Labour control of <b>Chorley</b> is impregnable.  Unfortunately we may lose the viral star of 2021 Tiger Patel, who was elected as a Conservative councillor for the safe Labour ward of Audley and Queens Park in Blackburn; he's no longer in the Conservatives and he is standing as an independent candidate for a different ward.

There is one by-election to report in the Lancashire districts not up for election, and that's in the ward of <a href="https://andrewteale.me.uk/izjy">Carnforth and Millhead</a>.  Carnforth is a railway town to the north of Lancaster, which still gets some tourist trade from being the location for shooting of the 1945 film <em>Brief Encounter</em>; legend has it that a very young Cecil Parkinson was an extra in that film, as his father worked at Carnforth station as a signalman.  The last time I was at the Carnforth station tearoom I had a brief encounter with ... the nuclear flask train, which turned up from Sellafield and stopped at the station waiting for its turn on the main line.  Suddenly the place was crawling with armed police.  They don't tell you that in the tourist brochures.

Carnforth and Millhead is a cursed ward which is having its fourth by-election in nine years following the death of Labour councillor Paul Gardner, who passed away just before Christmas at the age of 70.  He had represented the ward on and off since 2003.  As can be seen this by-election has taken quite a long time to organise, which is a bit of a shame since this is a marginal ward which is closely fought between Labour and the Conservatives, but we're here now.  The defending Labour candidate is Jackson Stubbs, former Tory ward councillor Peter Yates wants his seat back, and also standing are Emily Heath for the Green Party and Lynda Dagdeviren for the Lib Dems.
