<!-- Andrew's previews continue to be historical and electoral tours de force. - Lord Hayward -->
<blockquote>
"All the right votes, but not necessarily in the right order"
</blockquote>
</p><p>
Twenty by-elections on 10th October 2024:
</p><p>
<h2>Fortissat; and<br>
Mossend and Holytown</h2>
</p><p>
North Lanarkshire council, Scotland; caused respectively by the resignations of Labour councillors Kenneth Stevenson and Frank McNally.
</p><p>
This week is the busiest standalone week that Andrew's Previews has ever covered, with 20 local by-elections taking place and no other scheduled electoral events (local elections, Westminster elections, European parliament elections, police and crime commissioners) to combine them with.  All of today's polls are one of a kind.
</p><p>
Of the 20 seats up for election today in all three nations of Great Britain, the Labour party are defending eleven, the Conservatives five, independents two, and the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats one each.  Nine of these polls (eight for Labour, one for the Conservatives) are for seats which have been vacated by MPs who were elected to Westminster in July, and both of today's Scottish by-elections fall into that category.  They are for two adjoining wards in the Central Belt.
</p><p>

</p><p>
Located between Motherwell to the south and Airdrie and Coatbridge to the north, Mossend and Holytown are two of the many industrial settlements to the east of Glasgow which were created by the Industrial Revolution.  Holytown - the birthplace of Keir Hardie in 1856 - was historically a centre for coalmining, while Mossend was dominated by a large steelworks.  The modern electoral ward also includes a large part of Bellshill town centre.
</p><p>
Today Mossend is the location of two large rail freight terminals, while Holytown is dominated by the massive Eurocentral industrial estate next to the M8 motorway which takes up much of this ward's acreage.  Eurocentral was originally developed as a large factory for the Taiwanese firm Chunghwa, which opened in 1996 to make cathode ray tubes for TV sets and computer monitors; shortly afterwards the bottom fell out of this market as LCD and plasma screens became the norm, and by 2003 the factory was empty.  The Chunghwa factory has since been demolished; in its place we have a commercial and business park together with the "Big Heids", a sculpture made from metal tubes and upturned shipping containers.

</p><p>
The Lanarkshire urban area ends at Holytown, and beyond it we have the rural Fortissat ward.  The name "Fortissat" refers to an old estate which covered much of this area; the ward is the town of Shotts and its hinterland, located on high ground roughly halfway between Glasgow and Edinburgh.  Shotts' economy was also traditionally based on mining and ironworking; today a major local employer is the high-security prison HMP Shotts.  Shotts and Holytown both lie on a recently-electrified railway line between Edinburgh and Glasgow.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/n-lanarks-fortissat-2024.png" alt="N Lanarks, Fortissat" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
The local authority here is North Lanarkshire council, which returned an absolute majority of Labour councillors in 2007 and 2012 - a serious achievement in Scotland, where local elections use proportional representation - but where the SNP were the largest party in 2017 and 2022.  Following the 2022 elections the SNP actually took over the council as a minority, but the new council leader Jordan Linden was forced to resign within weeks over sexual harassment allegations: this led to the collapse of the SNP administration and Labour returning to control.  Linden quit the council in 2023 forcing a by-election in Bellshill ward, which Labour gained; earlier this year it was reported that Jordan Linden was to stand trial on 17 counts, including six charges of sexual assault.  The SNP group on the council has split, with several councillors walking off to form a new party called "Progressive Change North Lanarkshire".
</p><p>
This scandal probably wasn't decisive in Labour gaining all of North Lanarkshire's Westminster seats in July, but it won't have helped the SNP defence.  Following boundary changes, both of the wards up for election today are covered by the Airdrie and Shotts Westminster constituency which was gained by Labour candidate Kenneth Stevenson, who has a background in engineering.  Stevenson won a rematch against SNP MP Anum Qaisar, who had previously beaten him at a Westminster by-election in May 2021.
</p><p>
Qaisar had herself taken the Westminster seat over from Neil Gray, who resigned as SNP MP for Airdrie and Shotts in 2021 to successfully seek election for the Holyrood seat of the same name - he defeated the former Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard, who was however elected as a regional MSP for Central Scotland.  Gray quickly climbed the greasy pole into the Scottish Government, where he is the Cabinet secretary for health and social care.  His Holyrood seat covers Fortissat ward but not Mossend and Holytown ward, which is part of the Uddingston and Bellshill Scottish Parliament constituency represented by the SNP's Stephanie Callaghan.
</p><p>
The voters of Fortissat must now be getting a little tired of by-elections, having participated in two previous North Lanarkshire council by-elections in September 2017 and March 2021 plus the Westminster by-election in May 2021, which took place one week after the Holyrood elections due to Covid precautions restricting the capacity of the count.  A boundary review for the May 2017 elections had increased Fortissat from three seats to four, which split two to Labour candidates Martin McCulloch and Kenneth Stevenson and one each to the SNP and the Conservatives.  The newly-elected Conservative councillor Sandy Thornton then appears to have had second thoughts about becoming a councillor, and he declined to sign his declaration of acceptance of office; his seat was declared vacant after the two-month deadline for doing so expired, and the resulting by-election was easily gained by Labour.  The ward's SNP councillor Thomas Cochrane quit the party in 2018, and then left the council in March 2020 due to pressure of work; an intended by-election in November 2020 to fill the seat was aborted due to Covid, and when the by-election eventually took place in March 2021 it was gained by Labour giving Labour all four seats in Fortissat ward.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2022/n-lanarks22.png" alt="N Lanarks, 2022" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
With proportional representation in use, a full Labour slate wasn't sustainable in the long term and neither of the by-election winners sought re-election in Fortissat ward in 2022.  The 2017 by-election winner Claire Quigley stood down, while the 2021 by-election winner Peter Kelly instead contested Airdrie North without success.  Labour retained two seats on 36%, with the SNP recovering their by-election loss on 31% and the fourth seat going to the British Unionist Party on 19%.  Despite the name, the British Unionist Party doesn't appear to have much presence outside this rather Orange corner of the Central Belt; however, Fortissat ward borders the Armadale and Blackridge ward of West Lothian, which is similarly Orange and where a recent local by-election saw Reform UK poll a score which would have won them a seat in an ordinary election.  Rerunning the Fortissat 2022 count for a single vacancy gives 59% to Labour and 41% to the SNP after transfers.  Kenneth Stevenson MP had represented the ward since May 2017.
</p><p>
Mossend and Holytown ward has a much larger Catholic population and no British Unionist Party presence.  Its three seats have split two to Labour and one to the SNP at every election since the ward was created in 2007; the SNP actually polled more first preferences here in 2022, leading Labour 43-39, but Labour kept their second seat thanks to Unionist transfers from the Conservatives.  The ward's SNP councillor Beth Baudo subsequently joined the SNP splinter group Progressive Change North Lanarkshire, before she defected to Labour earlier this year to give Labour all three seats in the ward.
</p><p>
Rerunning the count in Mossend and Holytown for a single vacancy gives 1,765 votes to Labour's Frank McNally and 1,761 votes between the two SNP candidates (1,052 to Baudo and 709 to Michael Clarkson).  McNally had represented the ward since 2012, and he has also gone to Westminster after being elected in July as the MP for Coatbridge and Bellshill.
</p><p>
Both by-elections have a field of six candidates, although not the same six parties.  In Mossend and Holytown the defending Labour candidate Helena Gray is fighting her first election campaign.  Another first-timer on the ballot is Shahnawaz Khan, who is the Scottish National Party candidate.  Also standing are Aimee Alexander for the Conservatives, John Cole for the Liberal Democrats, Duncan Macmillan for Reform UK and Neil Wilson for UKIP.
</p><p>
In Fortissat the defending Labour candidate is again Clare Quigley, who won the previous by-election in September 2017 and represented the ward until 2022.  The SNP candidate is Brendan McAleese.  The British Unionist Party have nominated Billy Acheson, who should get a better result here than the 3% he managed in a by-election to Motherwell South East and Ravenscraig ward last November.  The Fortissat ballot paper is completed by Sheila Cameron for the Conservatives, Leigh Butler for the Liberal Democrats and Mary McIntosh, who is the first election candidate for the SNP splinter group Progressive Change North Lanarkshire.

<h2>Warton</h2>
</p><p>
Fylde council, Lancashire; caused by the death of independent councillor Julie Brickles.
</p><p>
Last week Andrew's Previews covered a by-election to Blackpool council in Marton ward, which became the first by-election gained by Reform UK from Labour.  Now it's time to turn that first letter upside down and go to nearby Warton.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/fylde-warton.png" alt="Fylde, Warton" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Warton is a large village on the main road from Preston to Lytham St Annes, whose economy is based on aviation.  Warton Aerodrome is the home of the Military Air and Information division of BAE Systems, and new military aircraft have been assembled and tested here ever since the Second World War.  In recent years Warton's production line has been dedicated to Eurofighter Typhoons.
</p><p>
During the Second World War Warton was used for similar purposes by the US Army Air Forces, and August 1944 saw the Freckleton Air Disaster where a B-24 heavy bomber on a test flight crashed into the next village to the east.  Nine days before that disaster, Major Glenn Miller and his band had played a concert here in front of 10,000 servicemen.  (One of these days, Glenn Miller's plane will finally land and he'll claim decades of royalties.)

</p><p>
There are now only three councils in the North West which have Conservative majorities: Lancashire county council, Fylde council and Wyre council.  In the case of Fylde, the Conservative majority was cut to just one seat at the 2023 elections which returned 19 Conservatives, 14 independents, 2 Labour and 2 Lib Dems.  Within the Fylde district the Conservative councillors tend to be concentrated in Lytham St Annes while independents do well in the rural wards, and Julie Brickles was one of those rural independents: she had been a Fylde councillor since 2011, originally being elected for Warton and Westby ward before it was broken up by boundary changes in 2023.  She passed away in July at the early age of 59, following a long illness.  Brickles had been re-elected in 2023 at the top of the poll in Warton ward, with 41% against 31% for the Conservatives (who won the ward's other seat) and 28% for Labour.
</p><p>
Warton ward is part of the Fylde South division of the county council and the Fylde parliamentary seat, both of which are in Conservative hands - although the Tories only held the Fylde constituency by 561 votes over Labour in July.  The newly-elected MP Andrew Snowden had previously been the Lancashire police and crime commissioner from 2021 to May 2024; he took the Fylde constituency over from Mark Menzies, who quit the Conservative party in April 2024 following a bizarre scandal involving misuse of campaign funds.  Allegations included Menzies being locked in a flat by someone he had met on an online dating site.
</p><p>
Julie Brickles' husband Michael is now hoping to succeed his late wife as an independent candidate; he contested Warton and Westby ward in 2019 and lost out on a seat by just 11 votes.  The Conservatives have reselected Bobby Rigby, a funeral director who represented the former Warton and Westby ward on Fylde council from 2019 to 2023; he stood for re-election here in 2023 but lost his seat.  The Labour candidate is Ross Kelly, and completing the ballot paper is Jayne Walsh of the Green Party.

<h2>Bamber Bridge West</h2>
</p><p>
South Ribble council, Lancashire; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Paul Foster.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/s-ribble-bamber-bridge-w.png" alt="S Ribble, Bamber Bridge W" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
We now travel across Preston to Bamber Bridge, one of the many small towns to the south of Preston which basically run into each other.  This is partly by design, as Preston and much of the area to the south of it was designated in 1970 as the Central Lancashire New Town.  Leyland was the largest new component of this New Town, but other towns in the area were expanded as well.
</p><p>
Bamber Bridge has a very ordinary ethnic profile - West ward is 4.4% non-white according to the 2021 census - but the town has gone down in history as the unlikely location of an American race riot.  The so-called Battle of Bamber Bridge occurred in June 1943, starting at a pub just outside the boundary of this ward called Ye Old Hob Inn.  At the time the 1511th Quartermaster Truck regiment, a logistics unit of the US Air Force with almost entirely black GIs commanded by almost entirely white officers, was stationed in Bamber Bridge.  Its soldiers often socialised in Ye Old Hob with the locals, in a way which they couldn't do back home in segregated America.  News had come through of race riots in Detroit, and the author Anthony Burgess - who lived in Bamber Bridge for a time - recounted that the US authorities had demanded a colour bar in Bamber Bridge's pubs in response.  The landlords, knowing where their profits were coming from, promptly put up signs saying "Black Troops Only".
</p><p>
Then a cack-handed attempt by white US military police to arrest a black soldier in Ye Old Hob, for not wearing the proper uniform, was thwarted by British servicewomen and local civilians.  The military police subsequently came back in numbers for another go, and there was a firefight which lasted most of the night.  One GI died.  All the other soldiers involved were back to normal duties within thirteen months, which was a very light punishment considering that this was a mutiny in wartime; the Eighth Air Force commander preferred to put most of the blame for the incident on the behaviour of the MPs.
</p><p>
For Parliamentary purposes Bamber Bridge is part of the Ribble Valley parliamentary seat, whose name is rather misleading: while it does contain lots of beautiful Ribble Valley countryside not all that many people live there, and the majority of the seat's population actually lives in Preston suburbs like Bamber Bridge and Fulwood.  Fulwood was transferred into the seat this year in exchange for Clitheroe, which was moved into the Pendle constituency.  This makes Ribble Valley exactly the sort of suburban seat where Labour did well this year, and in July Maya Ellis defeated the Conservative deputy speaker Nigel Evans by 856 votes to become the seat's first Labour MP.  Ellis is from the Ribble Valley end of the seat, where she was a parish councillor in Ribchester before entering the Commons.
</p><p>
That small Labour majority will likely have come out of Bamber Bridge, which is part of the Labour majority on South Ribble council.  All three elections in West ward since the current boundaries were introduced in 2015 have been straight Labour-Conservative fights, with Labour prevailing by 66-34 at the most recent district poll in 2023.  The Lancashire county council division of Lostock Hall and Bamber Bridge voted Conservative in 2021 but it is marginal, and Labour will need to gain it if they want to take control of the county council in 2025.
</p><p>
Bamber Bridge West ward has had a full slate of Labour councillors since 2007, when Labour gained a seat from the bizarrely-named "Idle Toad" political party.  This now-defunct group had been set up by former Labour councillor Tom Sharratt: Sharratt was deselected by the party in 1997, responded by distributing newsletters with that ironic name, got a good response from the public, and at their peak the Idle Toads had three South Ribble councillors and one Lancashire county councillor.
</p><p>
The councillor who gained the Idle Toad seat here in 2007 was Paul Foster, who subsequently became leader of the council in 2019 at the head of a Labour minority administration; Labour then gained an overall majority in 2023.  Foster had been in the Army before entering politics, and he served with the Royal Engineers in the Gulf War and Kosovo.  In July 2024 he was elected as the Labour MP for the key marginal seat of South Ribble, which is based on Leyland and Penwortham: he defeated first-term Conservative MP Katherine Fletcher.
</p><p>
Defending for Labour in the by-election to replace Paul Foster is David Bollenberg, who is "South Ribble born and bred" according to his social media; he works for Lancaster University as a research staff member.  The Conservatives have indulged in a bit of nominative determinism by selecting Stephen Bridge for Bamber Bridge; he contested Lostock Hall ward in the 2023 South Ribble elections.  This time we will not have a straight fight in Bamber Bridge West, as Paul Valentine has been nominated for the Lib Dems.

<h2>Farnley and Wortley</h2>
</p><p>
Leeds council, West Yorkshire; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Mark Sewards.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/leeds-farnley-wortley.png" alt="Leeds, Farnley/Wortley" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
For our Yorkshire poll today we have come to the city of Leeds.  ("Or I will accept Dirty Leeds", as a running joke in quizland used to go.)  The Farnley and Wortley ward lies to the west of Leeds city centre, on rising ground along the A58 Whitehall Road; Wortley is closer to the city centre, with Farnley further out.  We also have the detached settlement of New Farnley, a nineteenth-century village which was originally built to provide homes for workers at the local ironworks.  Open spaces within the ward include the Wortley Recreation Ground close to the city centre, and Farnley Hall Park on the outskirts: the latter was originally the grounds of Farnley Hall, which is now home to Leeds city council's parks and countryside service.
</p><p>
For many years Farnley and Wortley ward has been Leeds' Green Party hotspot in local elections, a fact which owes a lot to the campaigning abilities and personal votes of long-serving former councillors Ann and David Blackburn.  However, their grip on the ward has loosened in recent years with Labour wins in 2010, 2018 (one out of three seats) and each year since 2022.  In the May 2024 local elections the Greens had their best-ever performance in Leeds winning three wards, but Farnley and Wortley was not one of them: Labour polled 46% to gain the seat from Green candidate David Blackburn, who polled 35% with the Conservatives on 13%.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2024/leeds24.png" alt="Leeds, 2024" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
The recent Green collapse here started in 2022 when Ann Blackburn lost her seat to Labour candidate Mark Sewards, a maths teacher who already had two failed Parliamentary campaigns under his belt: he contested Harrogate and Knaresborough in the 2017 and 2019 general elections.  Boundary changes for the 2024 election transferred Farnley and Wortley ward into the Leeds South West and Morley constituency, and Sewards was adoped as the Labour candidate for that seat: he ended up defeating Dame Andrea Jenkins, the outgoing MP for the predecessor seat of Morley and Outwood, by the comfortable margin of 8,423 votes.
</p><p>
With Mark Sewards off to Westminster Labour have a Leeds city council by-election to defend.  Their candidate is Al Garthwaite, who was Lord Mayor of Leeds in 2023-24 and is seeking to make a quick return to the council after losing her seat in Hyde Park and Woodhouse ward in May.  Garthwaite is a long-standing advocate for women's rights, and back in 1977 she was a co-founder of Reclaim the Night which organised marches to protest against violence against women.  She is up against returning Green candidate David Blackburn, who also lost his seat in May after 26 years as a Leeds councillor.  Standing for the Conservatives is Lalit Suryawanshi, who contested Morley North ward in May and was the Conservative candidate for Dewsbury and Batley in July's general election.  Completing the Farnley and Wortley ballot paper are Peter Andrews for the Lib Dems, Richard Riley for the Social Democratic Party (who hold three seats on Leeds city council, all from Middleton Park ward), David Dresser for Reform UK, and independent (and ex-Conservative) candidate Peter Allison - who has accepted that is disqualified from this by-election, because he was employed by the council as a youth worker when his nomination papers went in.  Despite this, Allison is still on the ballot: if he wins, then he would be unable to take up his seat and there would need to be a fresh by-election.

<h2>Clay Cross North</h2>
</p><p>
North East Derbyshire council; caused by the death of Labour councillor Geoffrey Morley.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/ne-derbys-clay-cross-n.png" alt="NE Derbys, Clay Cross N" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
We now travel south into Derbyshire and come to the town of Clay Cross.  This is a mining town a few miles south of Chesterfield, located on the main road to Derby, which had an unusual genesis.  The story begins with the railway mania of the late 1830s, when the great railway engineer George Stephenson was driving a tunnel for the railway line between Sheffield and Derby.  The tunnellers ended up driving their railway through both a large coal seam and commercial quantities of ironstone.  Stephenson jumped at the chance to exploit this mineral wealth, and he formed the Clay Cross Company as a colliery, ironworks and brickworks which operated until the start of the 21st century.  The town of Clay Cross, located on the hill underneath which the railway tunnel runs, was essentially born to support all this industry.
</p><p>
The name of Clay Cross is notorious in local government for an episode in the early 1970s, after the Housing Finance Act 1972 ordered that all council house rents be increased by £1 per week from October 1972.  This did not go down well at all with Clay Cross urban district council, a seriously left-wing body which had been chaired by Dennis Skinner before his election to Parliament in 1970.  Clay Cross UDC had a policy of aggressively clearing slum housing from the town's original expansion and replacing it with new council houses at very low rents: by the early 1970s it owned around half of Clay Cross' housing stock, and its rents - at less than £1.70 per week including rates - were by far the lowest in the country.  The council's enforcement of rent arrears started not with legal action but with a visit from the chair and vice-chair of the housing committee, who would often find that the tenants were not claiming benefits that they were entitled to.
</p><p>
Clay Cross UDC refused to implement the statutory £1 per week rent increase, in a move which was locally very popular.  In the following local elections the entire Labour slate of 11 candidates was returned, including two of Dennis Skinner's brothers.  When a Housing Commissioner turned up in the town to collect the increased rents, he left empty-handed after a few months faced with complete non-cooperation both from the council, which refused to give him a desk, a chair or even a pencil, and from the tenants who went on a rent strike.
</p><p>
But the council ultimately could not escape the law.  In January 1973 all eleven members of Clay Cross urban district council were found guilty of negligence and misconduct for failing to implement the Housing Finance Act 1972.  They were surcharged by the District Auditor (ordered to pay £635 each to make up the rent shortfall), disqualified from public office for five years, and ended up being declared bankrupt.  What amounted to an extraordinary council election then had to be held in February 1974, which returned ten out of eleven Labour councillors with the other Labour candidate losing by two votes.  They also ended up surcharged and disqualified.  Four weeks later, Clay Cross urban district council was abolished in the "big bang" reorganisation of local government: the new local authority, North East Derbyshire council, immediately implemented the £1 per week rent increase.
</p><p>
North East Derbyshire district wraps around Chesterfield on three sides, taking in Clay Cross to the south and a number of Sheffield suburbs to the north including Dronfield.  The area has been moving politically to the right in recent years: the Conservatives gained the North East Derbyshire parliamentary seat in 2017, won overall control of the council in 2019 for the first time, and took the Clay Cross North seat on Derbyshire county council in 2021.  However, this momentum has not been sustained: North East Derbyshire then returned a Labour majority in the 2023 council elections and elected the Labour candidate in the 2024 general election, with Louise Jones (a former Army intelligence officer) defeating two-term Conservative MP Lee Rowley by 1,753 votes in July.
</p><p>
Clay Cross North ward was regularly uncontested in the early years of this century but it did swing to the Conservatives in 2023 against the district trend, with the Labour majority cut to a marginal 50-41.  So Labour have work to do here following the passing in July of long-serving councillor Gerry Morley at the age of 77.  Morley had served this ward continuously on North East Derbyshire council since 1995, and he was first elected to Clay Cross parish council in 1991.  He was chair of the parish council, and he had just become chair of the district council for 2024-25.
</p><p>
Defending this marginal ward for Labour is Emma Green.  The Conservatives have selected Jess Stokes, who was elected to Clay Cross parish council in a September 2023 by-election to become the parish's first-ever Conservative councillor.  An all-female ballot paper is completed by Leah Shafik for the Lib Dems and Ash Farrand for the Green Party.

<h2>St Michael's</h2>
</p><p>
Coventry council, West Midlands; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor David Welsh.
</p><p>
We now travel south to the city of Coventry.  The name of St Michael's ward refers to Coventry's two cathedrals, which are both dedicated to St Michael.  The modernist masterpiece of the 1960s stands next to the shattered ruins of its mediaeval predecessor, which stand both as a warning from history as to the horrors of war, and as a symbol of reconciliation in time of peace.  The old Coventry Cathedral was destroyed on the night of 14th and 15th November 1940, along with much of Coventry city centre.
</p><p>
Such was the scale of destruction on that night that post-war town planners more or less had a clean slate to work with in rebuilding Coventry city centre.  And it shows, with buildings of the 1950s and 1960s dominating the area within the Ring Road.  Coventry was the first UK city to have a pedestrianised shopping precinct, and the passage of time has not been particularly kind to it.  The mediaeval bulidings on Spon Street, and the Council House (built between the wars but deliberately designed to look a lot older than it is) with its exterior statues of Leofric and Godiva, form rare survivors of Coventry as it was.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/coventry-st-michaels.png" alt="Coventry, St Michael's" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
St Michael's ward covers the whole of the city centre, together with the Hillfields and Lower Stoke areas to the east and the area around Coventry railway station to the south.  Its economy and its census return are dominated by Coventry University, which was founded in 1970 as Lanchester Polytechnic and has grown into one of the UK's largest educational institutions.  The University's campus buildings are directly opposite the two cathedrals.  In the 2021 census 35.3% of St Michael's ward's residents were full-time students with another 10.7% being unemployed, giving the ward the third-highest unemployment rate in England and Wales; for those here who are in employment, St Michael's is in the top 10 wards in England and Wales for elementary occupations.  The ward is majority non-white with significant Asian and black populations.
</p><p>
You might expect from this demographic that St Michael's ward is politically left-wing, and indeed it is part of the large Labour majority on Coventry council.  But the actual flavour of left-wing politics here has historically been very unusual.  This is due to the figure of Dave Nellist, who was Labour MP for Coventry South East from 1983 until 1991, when he was kicked out of the Labour party due to his support for the Militant tendency.  Nellist went on to lose re-election to the Commons in 1992, but he has never left politics.  Since 1995 Nellist has regularly sought election in St Michael's ward under a variety of far-left labels, and he represented the ward on Coventry city council from 1998 to 2012 as a Socialist Alternative councillor.  After Nellist lost his seat in 2012 his vote steadily declined, and he fell into third place behind the Conservatives in 2021.  In May this year Labour led the Conservatives 62-10 in St Michael's ward, with the Tories finishing four votes ahead of Nellist.
</p><p>
Finishing last here in the 2016 and 2018 local elections (when she was aged 18 and 20) was the Green Party candidate Aimee Knight, then known as Aimee Challenor, who was at the time the Green Party's equalities spokesperson; she was a candidate for deputy leader of the party in 2018.  Knight's election agent for her May 2018 Coventry city council campaign here was her father David Challenor, which was a career-ending error of judgment on her part: three months later David Challenor was sent to prison for 22 years for violently sexually assaulting a 10-year-old girl.  After a short spell in the Lib Dems, Aimee Knight then quit politics (not altogether voluntarily) and emigrated to the USA, where she briefly came to prominence again in 2021.  Knight had been hired by Reddit as a staff member, Reddit banned a moderator of r/ukpolitics for linking to a critical <em>Spectator</em> article about Knight, and things escalated quickly from there.
</p><p>
Meanwhile back in the real world, St Michael's ward is part of the Coventry South parliamentary seat.  This has been represented since 2019 by Labour's Zarah Sultana, who won her first election by just 401 votes over the Conservatives but increased her majority to more than 10,000 in July this year.  Later that month Sultana lost the Labour Party whip for voting against the King's Speech over the 2-child benefit cap, and she is currently an independent MP.
</p><p>
This Coventry city council by-election is to replace Labour councillor David Welsh, who gained his seat from a Nellistite councillor in 2010 and had represented St Michael's ward since then.  Welsh had served in the council cabinet since 2020, latterly holding the housing and communities portfolio.  He is standing down to focus on his legal career.
</p><p>
Seven candidates have come forward to replace David Welsh, although this column hasn't found out much about them.  The defending Labour candidate is Sanjida Jobbar.  The Conservatives have reselected Mehmet Yetkin who stood here in May.  Also on the ballot are Dave Nellist for the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition, Thomas Jewell for the Green Party, Karen Wilson for the Coventry Citizens Party, Robyn Simpson for the Lib Dems and Ejaz Januja for the Workers Party of Britain.

<h2>Burton and Broughton</h2>
</p><p>
North Northamptonshire council; caused by the disqualification of Conservative councillor Chris Smith-Haynes.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/n-northants-burton-broughton.png" alt="N Northants, Burton/Broughton" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Travelling east from Coventry brings us into Northamptonshire, where we visit the small town of Burton Latimer.  This is located just to the south of Kettering, and its traditional industries were boot and shoemaking (in common with much of Northamptonshire) together with ironstone mining.  The town's location on the A14 road has resulted in some distribution parks springing up here in recent years: however, Burton Latimer's main export has for many years been Weetabix breakfast cereal, which is made here.
</p><p>

</p><p>
Northamptonshire is one of the relatively few areas which haven't seen any local elections since the good Conservative year of 2021, when the Tories won overall control of North Northamptonshire - a new council created by merging together four previous local government districts, including Kettering.  Burton and Broughton ward had originally been drawn up in 2013 as a Northamptonshire county council division, and it returned an independent county councillor in that year before going to the Conservatives in 2017.  Both of those were rather fragmented results, and the 2021 elections here were in the same vein: 34% of the vote to the winning Conservative slate, 22% to the Green Party, 20% to the Liberal Democrats and 13% to an independent.  The ward is part of the Kettering parliamentary seat, where Labour candidate Rosie Wrighting defaeted long-serving Conservative MP Philip Hollobone in July by 3,900 votes.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/n-northants21.png" alt="N Northants, 2021" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
This is by-election is to replace Conservative councillor Chris Smith-Haynes, who was first elected for this ward in the 2017 Northamptonshire county council elections; she had previously been a Kettering councillor in 2007-11.  Smith-Haynes has been in poor health recently, and her seat was declared vacant in August after she did not attend any meetings of the council in six months.
</p><p>
Defending this by-election for the Conservatives is Alex Evelyn: he is the deputy mayor of Kettering.  The Green Party were runners-up here in 2021 and they have reselected Adrian Watts, who works at the Weetabix factory and until recently was a Burton Latimer town councillor.  He gives an address on the same street as the Lib Dem candidate Jenny Davies, who is a former mayor of Burton Latimer; she previously served for 34 years on Luton council, including a spell as deputy leader.  There is no independent candidate this time, so Labour's Nigel Padget completes the ballot paper.

<h2>Hoxne and Eye</h2>
</p><p>
Suffolk county council; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Peter Gould.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/suffolk-cc-hoxne-eye.png" alt="Suffolk CC, Hoxne/Eye" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
We now travel east to a very rural county division consisting of 14 parishes in the northern Suffolk countryside.  Despite the order of the names the only town here is Eye, which with a population of just over 2,000 was historically one of the smallest boroughs in England.  The town originally claimed borough status based on a charter granted by King John in 1205, but in the nineteenth century it was demonstrated that this charter in fact related to the similarly-named town of Hythe in Kent.
</p><p>
But by this time it was a bit late to change all that history.  The town of Eye had been enfranchised in 1571: it returned two members of Parliament up until the 1832 Reform Act, and one MP from then until 1885.  For many years Eye was a pocket borough controlled by the Earls Cornwallis, who in the eighteenth century could effectively nominate its two MPs.  Although the town was disenfranchised in 1885, the Eye constituency lived on until 1983 as a county division of East Suffolk; John Gummer was its last MP, elected in 1979.
</p><p>
Major boundary changes for the 2024 general election created a completely new constituency called Waveney Valley, which contains territory from both Norfolk and Suffolk.  The Conservatives had done particularly badly here in the 2023 local elections, in which the Green Party had gained overall control of Mid Suffolk council and became the largest party on East Suffolk council; the Conservatives kept control of South Norfolk council by just one seat, which went to the Greens in a by-election in May.  The Green Party saw an opportunity, they worked this parliamentary seat hard, and they were rewarded in July when their candidate Adrian Ramsay defeated the Conservatives in Waveney Valley by 5,593 votes.  Ramsay has been co-leader of the Green Party since 2021, alongside his parliamentary colleague Carla Denyer, and he previously served on Norwich city council from 2003 to 2011.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/suffolk21.png" alt="Suffolk CC, 2021" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Quite what this means for the Hoxne and Eye by-election is difficult to tell, because the Green Party didn't stand here at the last Suffolk county council elections in 2021.  Hoxne and Eye has voted safely Conservative at all county council elections in the last two decades, and in 2021 the Conservatives polled 45% here against 25% for Guy McGregor, the division's previous long-serving Conservative councillor who stood for re-election as an independent, and 19% for the Lib Dems.  In the 2023 Mid Suffolk council elections the Conservatives carried three of the four wards which are wholly or partly in this division, but the Greens had a big lead in Eye ward which means that the two parties would have been very close to each other overall.
</p><p>
This by-election is to replace Conservative county councillor Peter Gould, who made his career in local government: he held a variety of chief officer roles, including seven years as chief executive of Northamptonshire county council in 2000-07.  After his retirement Gould entered local politics in 2019 as the Mid Suffolk councillor for Eye ward, which he served until standing down in 2023; in 2021 he made the step up to the county council.  Peter Gould passed away in July, at the age of 71.
</p><p>
Defending this by-election for the Conservatives is Henry Lloyd, who has previously worked in the environmental and higher education sectors; according to the website whocanivotefor.co.uk, his favourite biscuit is custard creams.  There is no independent candidate this time.  The Lib Dems' Timothy Glenton is back for another go after his third-place finish in 2021; we have since seen him as the Lib Dem candidate in the 2022 Thurston by-election to Mid Suffolk council, but this is his home turf.  Completing the ballot paper are Labour candidate Paul Theaker and the Greens' Joanne Brooks, who is standing for election for the first time.

<h2>Little Parndon and Town Centre</h2>
</p><p>
Harlow council, Essex; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Christopher Vince.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/harlow-little-parndon-town-centre.png" alt="Harlow, Lt Parndon/Town Ctr" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Our second by-election in the Eastern region today comes in a New Town.  Harlow was one of the first New Towns to be designated to provide housing for families who had been bombed out of London in the Second World War, and that legacy can be seen in the town still having very high levels of social housing.  Little Parndon, in the urban area's north-west corner, was one of the pre-existing villages which was swallowed up by the town, and it includes the town's main general hospital: the Princess Alexandra Hospital, which originally opened in 1958, is a major local employer.
</p><p>
Harlow has formed the basis of a parliamentary seat since February 1974, and it is a key marginal having voted for the government at every election since then with the exception of 1979.  The Harlow constituency includes some strongly-Conservative rural wards outside the town, but Labour candidate Chris Vince was able to overcome that when he gained the seat by 2,504 votes in July.  He took the seat over from the retiring Conservative MP Robert Halfon, who had served in a variety of frontbench roles under Cameron, May and Sunak and also chaired the Education select committee for five years.
</p><p>
Chris Vince had a large number of unsuccessful tilts at higher office before making it as MP for Harlow.  He was the Labour candidate for Chelmsford in the 2015 and 2017 general elections, he fought Hertford and Stortford in 2019, and he also stood in the 2016 and 2021 elections for Essex police and crime commissioner.  Andrew's Previews first wrote about Vince in March 2018, when he was elected to Harlow council for the first time in a by-election for Little Parndon and Hare Street ward, the predecessor to this ward.
</p><p>
Vince was the only Harlow Labour councillor to be re-elected in 2021, when the Conservatives swept ten of the town's eleven wards and won all four of Harlow's seats on Essex county council.  Little Parndon and Town Centre is part of the massive Harlow West county division, which returns two Essex county councillors and voted Conservative in 2021 by 48-42.  Following this Vince became leader of the council's Labour group.  The 2024 Harlow council elections were held on new ward boundaries and turned in a close result, with the Conservatives holding overall control by the narrowest possible margin of 17-16 over Labour.  Despite or perhaps because of the presence of a candidate called Dan Brown on the Conservative slate for Little Parndon and Town Centre, the result in this particular ward was not a great thriller: Labour won the ward by 57-29 over the Conservatives, with Chris Vince topping the poll and getting the maximum four-year term.
</p><p>
With Chris Vince having stood down to concentrate on his Westminster duties, Labour have a by-election to defend.  Their candidate is Linda Clark, who is an actress.  The Conservatives have selected Colleen Morrison, who represented the neighbouring Netteswell ward on the council from 2021 to 2024; in May she contested Bush Fair ward and was defeated.  Also standing are Ernesto Johnson for the Greens and candidates from two parties which didn't stand here in May, Mark Gough for UKIP (yes, they are still going) and Peter Lamb for Reform UK.

<h2>Hanger Hill;<br>
Northolt Mandeville; and<br>
South Acton</h2>
</p><p>
Ealing council, London; caused respectively by the resignations of Conservative councillor Gregory Stafford and Labour councillors Deirdre Costigan and Callum Anderson.
</p><p>
Six polls today take place within the M25 motorway, and we start by considering three by-elections in the London Borough of Ealing.  All of these result from Ealing councillors being elected to Parliament in July.  Deirdre Costigan, who was previously deputy leader of the council, has stayed within the borough as the new Labour MP for Ealing Southall, taking over from the retiring Virendra Sharma.  Callum Anderson and Gregory Stafford both won open seats outside London which were created by the boundary review: Anderson is now the Labour MP for Buckingham and Bletchley, while Stafford is part of the smaller intake of new Conservative MPs having narrowly won the seat of Farnham and Bordon which crosses the Hampshire-Surrey boundary.  This ensures there is still a member of the Stafford family in Parliament, because Gregory's brother Alexander Stafford was the Conservative MP for Rother Valley from 2019 to 2024.

Gregory Stafford had led the opposition on Ealing council until 2022, when the Conservatives fell to third place behind the Lib Dems: the 2022 Ealing elections returned 59 Labour councillors against 6 Lib Dems and 5 Conservatives.  His departure leaves a tricky by-election for the Conservatives to defend in Hanger Hill ward, which includes the notorious Hanger Lane gyratory system where the North Circular Road crosses the Western Avenue.  The London Underground stations at Hanger Lane, Park Royal, North Ealing and West Acton serve the ward.

</p><p>
Hanger Hill turned from a safe Conservative ward into a three-way marginal in 2022, with the Lib Dems polling 33%, the Conservatives 31% and Labour 23%; the ward's three seats split one to the Lib Dems and two to the Conservatives.  It's part of the safe-Labour parliamentary seat of Ealing Central and Acton which has been represented since 2015 by Rupa Huq (sister of Connie Huq and sister-in-law of Charlie Brooker).  Gregory Stafford had originally been elected here in 2014, transferring here from the former Cleveland ward where he had won a 2007 by-election; his former ward colleagues included Joy Morrissey, who left the council shortly after she was elected in 2019 as the Conservative MP for Beaconsfield.

</p><p>
We stay within the Ealing Central and Acton constituency to consider South Acton ward, which is in the top 100 wards in England and Wales for households in shared ownership - usually an indicator of some recent affordable housebuilding.  This ward covers the core of Acton, and it is served by the Underground station at Acton Town together with the Overground stations at Acton Central and South Acton.  Also here is the London Transport Museum Depot, where Transport for London store exhibits that don't fit in their main museum building at Covent Garden: it is occasionally open to the public.  Outgoing councillor Callum Anderson was in his first term; he was safely elected in 2022 with the Labour slate polling 48%, against 19% for the Greens and 15% for the Conservatives.  Acton has an important place in the UK's retail history: in 1904 Wallace Waite, Arthur Rose and David Taylor opened a grocery store at 263 Acton High Street, and after Taylor left the business a couple of years later the other two partners rebranded the shop as "Waitrose".

<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/ealing-northolt-mandeville.png" alt="Ealing, Northolt Mandeville" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
In the north-west corner of the borough we find another safe Labour ward, Northolt Mandeville.  This is centred on Northolt Underground station, which has High Speed 2 tunnels currently being bored underneath it.  This ward is more clearly Outer London and still had large amounts of open space until after the Second World War: for example, the Racecourse Estate is named after a former racecourse which was built on in the 1950s.  Since it's October, we should also mention that Northolt was the purported location of the Hallowe'en 1992 "live" broadcast of <em>Ghostwatch</em>, which the BBC have never dared to repeat.  In 2022 Northolt Mandeville gave the Labour slate a 55-26 lead over the Conservatives; the ward is part of the safe-Labour parliamentary seat of Ealing North, whose second-term Labour MP James Murray is now on the Treasury team.  Deirdre Costigan was first elected here in 2018.
</p><p>
All three by-elections have attracted a large field of at least six candidates.  In Northolt Mandeville the defending Labour candidate is Dominic Moffitt, who is a senior parliamentary assistant.  The Conservative candidate Andrew Bailey contested Perivale ward in 2022; he has a background in engineering.  Also standing for Northolt Mandeville are Natalia Kubica for the Greens, Pedro da Conceicao who was an 18-year-old independent candidate for Ealing Southall in the recent general election and has the Lib Dem nomination here, Conrad Lewandowski for Reform UK and Eltayeb Omima for the Workers Party of Britain.
</p><p>
South Acton ward has a total of eight candidates standing.  Here the Labour defence is led by Katie Douglas.  The Green candidate is Andrew Walkley, who is an English teacher and businessman.  Standing for the Conservatives is Kristian Mower, who does a lot of volunteer work as a consultant to the charity sector.  Completing the South Acton ballot are Timothy Hughes for the Lib Dems, independent candidate Julie Carter who finished in eighth and last place as an independent candidate for Ealing Central and Acton in July, David Hofman for the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition, Lucas Davies Herbst for the Workers Party of Britain, and Marco Manassero for Reform UK.
</p><p>
Finally, the Conservative defence in the marginal Hanger Hill ward is led by Sean Hanrahan, who works in the charity sector and contested Northfield ward in the 2022 Ealing elections.  Jonathan Oxley, one of the unsuccessful Lib Dem candidates for Hanger Hill in 2022, is back for another go; Oxley has previously served as a Conservative Ealing councillor in 2006-10, while his professional career has included spells as a partner at PwC and as interim chief executive of Ofcom.  The Labour candidate is Guneet Singh Malik.  Also standing in Hanger Hill are Kate Crossland for the Greens, Fabio Pukaj for Reform UK and Wagdi Thabit for the Workers Party of Britain.

<h2>Hersham Village; and<br>
Weybridge St George's Hill</h2>
</p><p>
Elmbridge council, Surrey; caused respectively by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Chester Chandler and by the death of the Conservative councillor Charu Sood.
</p><p>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EllPHWoIhow
</p><p>
Leaving Greater London but staying within the M25, there are two by-elections today to Elmbridge council which covers very affluent and very middle-class outer London suburbs along the main railway line into Waterloo.  Hersham is a case in point: this is such comfortable suburbia that it often features in TV or film productions looking for comfortable suburbia, partly thanks its proximity to Shepperton Studios on the other side of the River Thames.  Hersham and Walton-on-Thames railway stations lie on the ward's northern boundary.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/elmbridge-hersham-village.png" alt="Elmbridge, Hersham Village" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
But Hersham is very downmarket when compared with nearby St George's Hill, which has gone up in the world an awful lot since it was occupied by the Diggers in 1649.  This is now a private gated community of extremely prestigious and detached houses, whose list of present and former residents includes a number of very rich celebrities.  In fact, we even see a very rich celebrity in St George's Hill's previous election results: Kelvin Mackenzie, the former editor of the <em>Sun</em> newspaper, stood here in 2011 for the St George's Hill Independents and came close to winning.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/elmbridge-weybridge-st-georges-hill.png" alt="Elmbridge, Weybridge St George's Hill" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
The Weybridge St George's Hill ward also includes Whiteley Village, which is similar but for retirees: it was named after the nineteenth and twentieth-century department store owner William Whiteley, whose will left money for the purpose when he was murdered in 1907.  To the west the ward takes in the former Brooklands aerodrome and motor racing circuit, part of which is preserved as a museum with other parts of the circuit having been redeveloped for commercial use.  In the 2021 census Weybridge St George's Hill makes the top 30 wards in England and Wales for "managers, directors and senior officials"; many of these people will occasionally commute to London from Weybridge railway station, which lies on the ward's northern boundary.
</p><p>
In local elections Elmbridge council has traditionally been closely contested between the Conservatives and a patchwork of Residents Associations, which band together to form a single Residents group on the council.  The relevant parties here are the Hersham Village Society, and the Weybridge and St George's Independents.  The present Elmbridge ward boundaries were introduced in 2016, and both wards split their three seats between Conservative and Residents candidates at that election.  There were no Residents candidates for either the Hersham or Weybridge divisions at the 2021 Surrey county council elections, and the Conservatives won both of those seats comfortably.
</p><p>
But local politics in this corner of Surrey has changed in recent years.  The district borders and has a similar demographic to the London Boroughs of Kingston upon Thames and Richmond upon Thames, both of which have been Lib Dem strongholds in recent years.  Elmbridge voted strongly for Remain in the 2016 EU referendum, which made the then Conservative MP and prominent Brexiteer Dominic Raab - whose constituency of Esher and Walton covered most of the district - a very poor fit for the area.  At the time of the 2019 general election Raab was foreign secretary; the Liberal Democrats had a serious go at his seat, and they came up 2,743 votes short.
</p><p>
The Lib Dems have a coalition and electoral pact with the Residents in Elmbridge council elections, and they followed up on that parliamentary near-miss by effectively displacing the Residents as the main anti-Conservative force in the district.  The Lib Dems are now clearly the largest party on the council and are close to an overall majority, although this has so far eluded them.  The Hersham Village Society ceased to contest elections in 2021 and Hersham ward has been closely fought between the Lib Dems and the Conservatives since then; in May the Lib Dems gained the ward's third seat from the Conservatives by a margin of 49-44.  The outgoing Lib Dem councillor Chester Chandler, who resigned because he has emigrated to Australia, was first elected here in 2022.
</p><p>
Dominic Raab was forced out of Cabinet in 2023 for bullying civil servants, and he left the Commons the following year.  His former Esher and Walton seat, which includes Hersham, is now held by the Liberal Democrats' Monica Harding who gained the constituency by 12,003 votes in July.  Harding had previously been the unsuccessful Lib Dem candidate here in 2019.  She came to the Commons from a career in international development, much of which was spent overseas in Europe and Asia, and last month she joined the party frontbench as the Lib Dem spokesperson for that topic.
</p><p>
Weybridge St George's Hill ward is part of the Runnymede and Weybridge constituency, which did manage to re-elect its Conservative MP this year by quite a comfortable margin.  Ben Spencer is starting his second term of office; going into July's general election he was deputy chairman of the Conservative Party, and he is now a junior shadow minister focusing on mental health.  Which is also appropriate, because Spencer was a doctor specialising in mental health before his election to Parliament in 2019.
</p><p>
The Lib Dems do not contest Weybridge St George's Hill ward, which has been closely fought for many years between the Conservatives and the Weybridge and St George's Independents.  The seat split is currently 2-1 in the Independents' favour, and they won the most recent election here in May 2024 by a 53-29 margin.  The Conservatives are defending their last seat in the ward following the death of Charu Sood in August from cancer; she had represented Weybridge St George's Hill since 2018, and she twice served as deputy mayor of Elmbridge.
</p><p>
Defending Weybridge St George's Hill for the Conservatives is Colin McFarlane, who chairs the party's Runnymede and Weybridge branch; he is retired from a career in business development and project management.  The Weybridge and St George's Independents have selected Andrew Kelly, who has previously served as a Conservative councillor for wards in Walton-on-Thames from 2010 to 2021; he sought re-election in 2021 as an independent candidate for Walton North and was defeated, and he has since contested Elmbridge elections without success on the ticket of the Walton Society (that's the Residents' group for Walton-on-Thames, rather than a John-Boy Walton fan club).  The only other candidate is Brittany Johansson for the Green Party.
</p><p>
In Hersham the defending Lib Dem candidate is Varsha Khodiyar, who is a consultant specialising in data management and data science.  Her main competition will come from the Conservatives' John O'Reilly, who is the county councillor for Hersham division (which covers a larger area than this ward) and is a retired oil industry executive.  Also standing here is Francis Eldergill for Labour.

<h2>Addlestone South</h2>
</p><p>
Runnymede council, Surrey; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Jonathan Wilson.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/runnymede-addlestone-s.png" alt="Runnymede, Addlestone S" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
We now cross the River Wey from Weybridge and come to Addlestone, another of the prosperous Surrey commuter towns within the M25 that never made it into Greater London.  Addlestone South ward covers the southern half of the town including the offices of Runnymede council, a borough created in 1974 from the merger of the former Chertsey and Egham urban districts.
</p><p>
I mentioned in the previous section that Runnymede and Weybridge still has a Conservative MP, but Runnymede is no longer a Conservative-run council.  It became hung in 2023 after 25 years of Conservative majority control, and further Tory losses in 2024 made their administration untenable.  Runnymede's council leadership is now a four-way jobshare between the leaders of the Labour group (8 councillors), the Lib Dem group (6), the Runnymede Independent Residents Group (6) and the Greens (3), who are supported by the two independent councillors for Englefield Green East ward; the Conservatives (12 seats plus this vacancy) and the independent councillors for Ottershaw ward (2 plus another vacancy) are in opposition.  Following the loss of Reigate and Banstead in 2024, Surrey county council is now the only local government district with a Conservative majority in Surrey - whatever definition of Surrey you use.
</p><p>
The Conservatives still hold the Addlestone division on Surrey county council and all three seats in Addlestone South ward, although this May's election was very close: the Conservatives held off Labour by 605 votes to 596, a majority of nine votes.  In percentage terms that was 42-41.  One of the other councillors for this ward is the Conservative group leader Peter Snow, who might not remember that particular election count as "just a bit of fun".
</p><p>
This tiny majority makes Addlestone South a difficult by-election for the Conservatives to defend following the death in August of Jonathan Wilson, at the appallingly early age of 38.  Wilson was first elected to the council in 2006 when he was a 22-year-old student at Royal Holloway, representing Egham Hythe ward; after being defeated there in 2018, he transferred to Addlestone South in 2019.
</p><p>
Defending this seat for the Conservatives is Steve Eldridge, who worked for Runnymede council until June as a communications officer.  Labour have reselected Elaine Percival, who lost out here by nine votes in May and by 80 votes last year.  Also standing are Jenny Coulon for the Lib Dems and Jess Ward for the Green Party.

<h2>Wivelsfield</h2>
</p><p>
Lewes council, East Sussex; caused by the resignation of Green Party councillor William Coupland.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/lewes-wivelsfield.png" alt="Lewes, Wivelsfield" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Our tour of England now takes us to Sussex and to Wivelsfield.  This is a rural parish covering the countryside to the south-east of Haywards Heath and to the north-east of Burgess Hill, both of which are in the county of West Sussex whereas Wivelsfield parish is in East Sussex.  The ward does not include Wivelsfield railway station on the Brighton line, which is actually in Burgess Hill.  Some new housing on the edges of both Burgess Hill and Haywards Heath has spilled over into the ward in recent years, and this shows up clearly in the census return: in 2021 Wivelsfield made the top 70 wards in England and Wales for households in shared ownership (5.0%).
</p><p>
This being East rather than West Sussex, the local authority here is Lewes council which turned in an astonishing result in the 2023 local elections: the Greens became the largest party with 17 councillors, the Lib Dems won 15, Labour won 9, and the Conservatives - who had been the largest party here in 2019 - were completely wiped out.  A Green-Labour coalition is running the show.  Wivelsfield was one of the Conservative losses last year, with the Greens coming from a poor third place in 2019 to defeat the Conservatives by 53-37.  Unfortunately the new councillor William Coupland has since suffered a stroke, and he stepped down after a year in office on health grounds.
</p><p>
The Tories do still represent Wivelsfield ward at other levels of government.  They narrowly held the Chailey division of East Sussex county council in 2021 against a Green challenge, and Wivelsfield is part of the Conservative-held East Grinstead and Uckfield parliamentary seat.  Mims Davies was comfortably elected there in July against split opposition to win her fourth term of office in her third constituency: she was originally elected for Eastleigh in 2015, before transferring to Mid Sussex in 2019.
</p><p>
Defending this seat for the Green Party is Sue Morris, an accountant who sits on Wivelsfield parish council.  The Conservatives have selected Sarah Webster, who runs a recruitment business and is chair of Horsted Keynes parish council; she was their Parliamentary candidate for Brighton Pavilion three months ago.  Nadine Stothard completes the ballot paper for the Lib Dems.

<h2>Heene</h2>
</p><p>
Worthing council, West Sussex; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Richard Mulholland.
</p><p>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Xa4bHcJu8
</p><p>
For our other Sussex by-election it's back to the Worthing seafront, which this column visited three weeks ago in (yet again) previewing the town's Marine ward.  That by-election was a Conservative gain from Labour, a much-needed boost for the Worthing Conservatives after Sir Peter Bottomley MP suffered the embarrassment in July of becoming the only Father of the House ever to lose re-election.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/worthing-heene.png" alt="Worthing, Heene" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Many of the remarks which I made in the Marine ward preview last month also apply to the next-door ward of Heene, which covers much of West Worthing.  Heene ward runs southwards from West Worthing railway station to the seafront, and it lies directly west of Worthing town centre.  It has an unusually old age profile for an urban ward, making the top 50 wards in England and Wales for residents aged 85 or over (7.4%); that's not very typical of Worthing, which is much less of an elephant's graveyard than some other Sussex seaside towns.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2024/worthing24.png" alt="Worthing, 2024" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Heene ward now has Labour representatives at all levels of government.  The former Labour council leader Beccy Cooper became the MP for Worthing West in July (provoking the Marine ward by-election which Labour lost last month), Labour gained the two West Sussex county council divisions covering Heene ward in 2021 (Worthing Pier and Worthing West), and Heene ward itself has voted Labour at every Worhing council election since 2018 - before then it voted Conservative.  In May Labour led the Conservatives here by 57-26, a slightly larger majority than the 56-31 lead which the Conservatives recently overturned in Marine ward.
</p><p>
Richard Mulholland was a Labour councillor for Heene from 2018 until his resignation in August, for undisclosed reasons.  Defending his seat in the resulting by-election is Anthony Squires, who contested the town's Salvington ward in May.

<h2>Shirley</h2>
</p><p>
Southampton council, Hampshire; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Satvir Kaur.
</p><p>
<img src="https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/dont-call-me-shirley-airplane.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=825&dpr=1.5" alt="I am serious" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Our tour of England concludes in Shirley, a north-western suburb of Southampton.  Shirley's old town centre lies on the main road going north-west from Southampton city centre towards Romsey; the Shirley ward extends north and east from here to take in Southampton Common and the large Southampton General Hospital.  In 1980 a boy called Rishi Sunak was born at that hospital, and the pharmacy which Sunak's mother ran for many years lies just outside the boundary of Shirley ward.  The presence of Southampton General Hospital means that Shirley ward is within the top 25 wards in England and Wales for those working in the health and social work sector (26.8% of the workforce).
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/southampton-shirley.png" alt="Southampton, Shirley" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Shirley was once, very briefly, the centre of its own local government unit: the Shirley and Fremantle Urban District was created in 1894, and then abolished just a year later when its area was annexed by Southampton.  The modern Shirley ward of Southampton council took on its current boundaries in 2002, and has trended towards the left over the last 22 years: Shirley ward consistently voted Conservative up to 2010, then changed to consistently voting Labour from 2011.  In May Labour held the ward with 40% of the vote against 25% for the Conservatives (an unusually poor score) and 20% for the Liberal Democrats (an unusually good score).
</p><p>
Since 1950 Southampton has been divided into two parliamentary seats which are named after rivers: the Itchen seat is eastern Southampton, while the Test constituency covers the western half of the city including Shirley.  Test has been in Labour hands since 1997 when it was gained by Alan Whitehead, who had previously been leader of Southampton council and had made three previous failed attempts on the seat.  Whitehead retired at this summer's general election and successfully passed his seat on to another former Southampton council leader.  Satvir Kaur had represented Shirley ward on the council since 2011, and she became leader of the opposition Labour group in 2021 and then leader of the council when Labour took control of Southampton in 2022.  Kaur was the first Sikh woman to lead a council in the UK.
</p><p>
With Satvir Kaur off to Westminster, the defending Labour candidate in the Southampton council by-election to replace her is Victoria Ugwoeme: she is described as a community activist and radio presenter, she is associated with the GMB union, and she is looking to make a quick return to the council after losing her seat to the Conservatives in Woolston ward in May.  The Conservatives have reselected Andrew Hetherton who is their regular candidate for this ward; he runs a consulting firm specialising in property taxation.  Also returning from May's election is Lib Dem candidate George Percival, who is a full-time firefighter.  Completing the Shirley ward ballot paper are Barrie Margetts for the Green Party, Maggie Fricker for the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition, and independent candidate Andrew Pope; Margetts and Pope have both previously served as Southampton Labour councillors for different wards.

<h2>The Havens</h2>
</p><p>
Pembrokeshire council, West Wales; caused by the death of independent councillor Peter Morgan.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/pembs-havens.png" alt="Pembs, The Havens" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
After 17 by-elections in England, this column finishes for the week in the Little England Beyond Wales - the part of southern Pembrokeshire lying south of the Landsker line which for centuries has been predominantly English-speaking.  The Havens here are the villages of Broad Haven, Little Haven and Nolton Haven, which are all located on the eastern coast of St Brides Bay - the large bay on Pembrokeshire's west coast between the city of St David's and the town of Milford Haven.
</p><p>
Most of The Havens ward lies within the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park, with the main exception being the village of Roch.  The National Park boundaries do however include Roch Castle, which was built in the 12th century to defend Little England: the castle occupies a dramatic location on a rocky outcrop above the village.  Roch Castle was restored in 1900 by new owner John Philipps, who was at the time the Liberal MP for Pembrokeshire, and it is now run as a hotel.
</p><p>
Liberalism isn't much of a feature of Pembrokeshire's politics these days.  In the 2024 Westminster election the newly-drawn seat of Mid and South Pembrokeshire was won by Labour candidate Henry Tufnell, who defeated the former Conservative cabinet minister Stephen Crabb by 1,878 votes.  Tufnell was a barrister associated with the Cleaners and Allied Independent Workers' Union before entering Parliament, and he also won a bronze medal in the 800 metres at the 2014 British Athletics Championships.  Since 2007 the Senedd constituency of Preseli Pembrokeshire has been held by Conservative MS Paul Davies, who was leader of the Welsh Conservatives from 2018 until he resigned in 2021 over a potential breach of Welsh COVID-19 regulations.
</p><p>
In local elections Pembrokeshire is one of the last strongholds of the rural independent councillor, and Pembrokeshire county council has had an independent majority since its re-establishment in 1996.  The Havens ward has returned independent candidates at every election this century, and it had been held since 2008 by Peter Morgan.
</p><p>
Peter Morgan, who died in July from a brain tumour at the age of 65, had a very distinguished career in rugby as a utility back.  He played 275 matches for Llanelli, scoring 90 tries.  At international level Morgan was capped four times by Wales (his final game was against Ireland in 1981), and he was selected for the 1980 British and Irish Lions tour of South Africa although he ultimately played no Tests there.  Morgan turned down a fee of £300,000 from St Helens, which would have been a world record at the time, to turn professional and play rugby league.  After his sporting days were over Peter Morgan was elected four times to Pembrokeshire county council, serving as chair in 2012-13; his final re-election in 2022 was by 59-41 in a straight fight with the Conservatives.
</p><p>
Morgan's passing leaves an open seat on Pembrokeshire council.  Two independent candidates are standing to succeed him: Jony Griff is described as an independent focusing on local issues, while Mike Harris has previously had a controversial term as an independent Torfaen councillor which saw him being censured by the Public Services Ombudsman for Wales for a social media post wrongly linking a local man to Jimmy Savile.  Nick Neumann is back for the Conservatives after his strong second place in 2022; he runs a tourism business at Newgale within the ward.  Thomas Hughes, for the Lib Dems, completes the ballot paper.
