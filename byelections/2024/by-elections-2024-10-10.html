<h2>Warton</h2>

Fylde council, Lancashire; caused by the death of independent councillor Julie Brickles.

Last week Andrew's Previews covered a by-election to Blackpool council in Marton ward, which became the first by-election gained by Reform UK from Labour.  Now it's time to turn that first letter upside down and go to nearby Warton.

Warton is a large village on the main road from Preston to Lytham St Annes, whose economy is based on aviation.  Warton Aerodrome is the home of the Military Air and Information division of BAE Systems, and new military aircraft have been assembled and tested here ever since the Second World War: in recent years Warton's production line has been dedicated to Eurofighter Typhoons.

During the Second World War Warton was used for similar purposes by the US Army Air Forces, and August 1944 saw the Freckleton Air Disaster where a B-24 heavy bomber on a test flight crashed into the next village to the east.  Nine days before that disaster, Major Glenn Miller and his band had played a concert here to 10,000 servicemen.  (One of these days, Glenn Miller's plane will finally land and he'll claim decades of royalties.)

There are now only three councils in the North West which have Conservative majorities: Lancashire county council, Fylde council and Wyre council.  In the case of Fylde, the Conservative majority was cut to just one seat at the 2023 elections which returned 19 Conservatives, 14 independents, 2 Labour and 2 Lib Dems.  Within the Fylde district the Conservative councillors tend to be concentrated in Lytham St Annes while independents do well in the rural wards, and Julie Brickles was one of those rural independents: she had been a Fylde councillor since 2011, originally being elected for Warton and Westby ward before it was broken up by boundary changes in 2023.  She passed away in July at the early age of 59, following a long illness.  Brickles had been re-elected in 2023 at the top of the poll in Warton ward, with 41% against 31% for the Conservatives (who won the ward's other seat) and 28% for Labour.

Warton ward is part of the Fylde South division of the county council and the Fylde parliamentary seat, both of which are in Conservative hands - although the Tories only held the Fylde constituency by 561 votes over Labour in July.  The newly-elected MP Andrew Snowden had previously been the Lancashire police and crime commissioner from 2021 to May 2024; he took the seat over from Mark Menzies, who quit the party in April 2024 following a bizarre scandal involving misuse of campaign funds.  Allegations included Menzies being locked in a flat by someone he had met on an online dating site.

Julie Brickles' husband Michael is now hoping to succeed his late wife as an independent candidate; he contested Warton and Westby ward in 2019 and lost out on a seat by just 11 votes.  The Conservatives have reselected Bobby Rigby, a funeral director who represented the former Warton and Westby ward on Fylde council from 2019 to 2023; he stood for re-election here in 2023 but lost his seat.  The Labour candidate is Ross Kelly, and completing the ballot paper is Jayne Walsh of the Green Party.

<h2>Farnley and Wortley</h2>

Leeds council, West Yorkshire; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Mark Sewards.

For our Yorkshire poll today we have come to the city of Leeds.  ("Or I will accept Dirty Leeds", as a running joke in quizland used to go.)  The Farnley and Wortley ward lies to the west of Leeds city centre, on rising ground along the A58 Whitehall Road; Wortley is closer to the city centre, with Farnley further out.  We also have the detached settlement of New Farnley, a nineteenth-century village originally built to provide homes for workers at the local ironworks.  Open spaces within the ward include the Wortley Recreation Ground close to the city centre and Farnley Hall Park on the outskirts: the latter was originally the grounds of the stately home of Farnley Hall, which is now home to Leeds city council's parks and countryside service.

For many years Farnley and Wortley ward has been Leeds' Green Party hotspot in local elections, a fact which owes a lot to the campaigning abilities and personal votes of long-serving former councillors Ann and David Blackburn.  However, their grip on the ward has loosened in recent years with Labour wins in 2010, 2018 (one out of three seats) and each year since 2022.  In the May 2024 local elections the Greens had their best-ever performance in Leeds winning three wards, but Farnley and Wortley was not one of them: Labour polled 46% to gain the seat from Green candidate David Blackburn, who polled 35% with the Conservatives on 13%.

The recent Green collapse here started in 2022 when Ann Blackburn lost her seat to Labour candidate Mark Sewards, a maths teacher who already had two failed Parliamentary campaigns under his belt (he contested Harrogate and Knaresborough in the 2017 and 2019 general elections).  Boundary changes for the 2024 election transferred Farnley and Wortley ward into the Leeds South West and Morley constituency, and Sewards was adoped as the Labour candidate for that seat: he ended up defeating Dame Andrea Jenkins, the outgoing MP for the predecessor seat of Morley and Outwood, by the comfortable margin of 8,423 votes.

With Mark Sewards off to Westminster Labour have a Leeds city council by-election to defend.  Their candidate is Al Garthwaite, who was Lord Mayor of Leeds in 2023-24 and is seeking to make a quick return to the council after losing her seat in Hyde Park and Woodhouse ward in May.  Garthwaite is a long-standing advocate for women's rights, and back in 1977 she was a co-founder of Reclaim the Night which organised marches to protest against violence against women.  She is up against returning Green candidate David Blackburn, who also lost his seat in May after 26 years as a Leeds councillor.  Standing for the Conservatives is Lalit Suryawanshi, who contested Morley North ward in May and was the Conservative candidate for Dewsbury and Batley in July's general election.  Completing the Farnley and Wortley ballot paper are Peter Andrews for the Lib Dems, Richard Riley for the Social Democratic Party (who hold three seats on Leeds city council, all from Middleton Park ward), David Dresser for Reform UK, and independent candidate Peter Allison - who has accepted that is disqualified from this by-election, because he was employed by the council as a youth worker when his nomination papers went in.  Despite this, Allison is still on the ballot: if he wins, then he would be unable to take up his seat and there would need to be a fresh by-election.

<h2>St Michael's</h2>

Coventry council, West Midlands; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor David Welsh.

We now travel south to the city of Coventry.  The name of St Michael's ward refers to Coventry's two cathedrals, which are both dedicated to St Michael.  The modernist masterpiece of the 1960s stands next to the shattered ruins of its mediaeval predecessor, which stand both as a warning from history as to the horrors of war, and as a symbol of reconciliation in time of peace.  The old Coventry Cathedral was destroyed on the night of 14th and 15th November 1940, along with much of Coventry city centre.

Such was the scale of destruction on that night that post-war town planners more or less had a clean slate to work with in rebuilding Coventry city centre.  And it shows, with buldings of the 1950s and 1960s dominating the area within the Ring Road; Coventry was the first UK city to have a pedestrianised shopping precinct, and the passage of time has not been particularly kind to it.  The mediaeval bulidings on Spon Street, and the interwar Council House (deliberately designed to look a lot older than it is) with its exterior statues of Leofric and Godiva, form rare survivors of Coventry as it was.

St Michael's ward covers the whole of the city centre, together with the Hillfields and Lower Stoke areas to the east and the area around Coventry railway station to the south.  Its economy and census return are dominated by Coventry University, which was founded in 1970 as Lanchester Polytechnic and has grown into one of the UK's largest educational institutions.  The University's campus buildings are directly opposite the two cathedrals.  In the 2021 census 35.3% of St Michael's ward's residents were full-time students with another 10.7% being unemployed, giving the ward the third-highest unemployment rate in England and Wales; for those here who are in employment, St Michael's is in the top 10 wards in England and Wales for elementary occupations.  The ward is majority non-white with significant Asian and black populations.

You might expect from this demographic that St Michael's ward is politically left-wing, and indeed it is part of the large Labour majority on Coventry council.  But the actual flavour of left-wing politics here has historically been very unusual.  This is due to the figure of Dave Nellist, who was Labour MP for Coventry South East from 1983 until 1991, when he was kicked out of the Labour party due to his support for the Militant tendency.  Since losing re-election to the Commons in 1992 Nellist has regularly sought election in St Michael's ward since 1995 under a variety of far-left labels, and he represented the ward on Coventry city council from 1998 to 2012 as a Socialist Alternative councillor.  Since then Nellist's vote has steadily declined, and he fell into third place behind the Conservatives in 2021.  In May this year Labour led the Conservatives 62-10 in St Michael's ward, with the Tories finishing four votes ahead of Nellist.

Finishing last here in the 2016 and 2018 local elections (when she was aged 18 and 20) was the Green Party candidate Aimee Knight, then known as Aimee Challenor, who was at the time the Green Party's equalities spokesperson; she was a candidate for deputy leader of the party in 2018.  Knight's election agent for her May 2018 Coventry city council campaign here was her father David Challenor, which was a career-ending error of judgment on her part: three months later David Challenor was sent to prison for 22 years for violently sexually assaulting a 10-year-old girl.  After a brief spell in the Lib Dems, Aimee Knight then quit politics (not altogether voluntarily) and emigrated to the USA, where she briefly came to prominence again in 2021.  Knight had been hired by Reddit as a staff member, Reddit banned a moderator of r/ukpolitics for linking to a critical <em>Spectator</em> article about Knight, and things escalated quickly from there.

Meanwhile back in the real world, St Michael's ward is part of the Coventry South parliamentary seat.  It has been represented since 2019 by Zarah Sultana, who won her first election by just 401 votes but increased her majority to over 10,000 in July this year.  Later that month Sultana lost the Labour Party whip for voting against the King's Speech over the 2-child benefit cap, and she is currently an independent MP.

This Coventry city council by-election is to replace Labour councillor David Welsh, who gained his seat from a Nellistite councillor in 2010 and had represented St Michael's ward since then.  Welsh had served in the council cabinet since 2020, latterly holding the housing and communities portfolio.  He is standing down to focus on his legal career.

Seven candidates have come forward to replace David Welsh, although this column hasn't found out much about them.  The defending Labour candidate is Sanjida Jobbar.  The Conservatives have reselected Mehmet Yetkin who stood here in May.  Also on the ballot are Dave Nellist for the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition, Thomas Jewell for the Green Party, Karen Wilson for the Coventry Citizens Party, Robyn Simpson for the Lib Dems and Ejaz Januja for the Workers Party of Britain.

<h2>Burton and Broughton</h2>

North Northamptonshire council; caused by the disqualification of Conservative councillor Chris Smith-Haynes.

Travelling east from Coventry brings us into Northamptonshire, where we visit the small town of Burton Latimer.  This is located just to the south of Kettering, and its traditional industries were boot and shoemaking (in common with much of Northamptonshire) together with ironstone mining.  The town's location on the A14 road has resulted in some distribution parks springing up here in recent years: however, Burton Latimer's main export has for many years been Weetabix breakfast cereal, which is made here.

Northamptonshire is one of the relatively few areas which haven't seen any local elections since the good Conservative year of 2021, when the Tories won overall control of North Northamptonshire - a new council created by merging together four previous local government districts, including Kettering.  Burton and Broughton ward had originally been drawn up in 2013 as a Northamptonshire county council division, and it returned an independent county councillor in 2013 before going to the Conservatives in 2017.  Both of those were rather fragmented results, and the 2021 elections here were in the same vein: 34% of the vote to the Conservative slate, 22% to the Green Party, 20% to the Liberal Democrats and 13% to an independent.  The ward is part of the Kettering parliamentary seat, where Labour candidate Rosie Wrighting defaeted long-serving Conservative MP Philip Hollobone in July by 3,900 votes.

This is by-election is to replace Conservative councillor Chris Smith-Haynes, who was first elected for this ward in the 2017 Northamptonshire county council elections and had previously been a Kettering councillor in 2007-11.  Smith-Haynes has been in poor health recently, and her seat was declared vacant in August after she did not attend any meetings of the council in six months.

Defending this by-election for the Conseravtives is Alex Evelyn: he is the deputy mayor of Kettering.  The Green Party were runners-up here in 2021 and they have reselected Adrian Watts, who works at the Weetabix factory and until recently was a Burton Latimer town councillor.  He gives an address on the same road as the Lib Dem candidate Jenny Davies, who is a former mayor of Burton Latimer; she previously served for 34 years on Luton council, including a spell as deputy leader.  There is no independent candidate this time, so Labour's Nigel Padget completes the ballot paper.

<h2>Hanger Hill;<br>
Northolt Mandeville; and<br>
South Acton</h2>

Ealing council, London; caused respectively by the resignations of Conservative councillor Gregory Stafford and Labour councillors Deirdre Costigan and Callum Anderson.

Six polls today take place within the M25 motorway, and we start by considering three by-elections in the London Borough of Ealing.  All of these result from Ealing councillors being elected to Parliament in July.  Deirdre Costigan, who was previously deputy leader of the council, has stayed within the borough as the new Labour MP for Ealing Southall, taking over from the retiring Virendra Sharma.  Callum Anderson and Gregory Stafford both won open seats outside London which were created by the boundary review: Anderson is now the Labour MP for Buckingham and Bletchley, while Gregory Stafford is part of the smaller intake of new Conservative MPs having narrowly won the seat of Farnham and Bordon which crosses the Hampshire-Surrey boundary.  This ensures there is still a member of the Stafford family in Parliament, as Gregory's brother Alexander Stafford was the Conservative MP for Rother Valley from 2019 to 2024.

Gregory Stafford had led the opposition on Ealing council until 2022, when the Conservatives fell to third place behind the Lib Dems: the 2022 Ealing elections returned 59 Labour councillors against 6 Lib Dems and 5 Conservatives.  His departure leaves a tricky by-election for the Conservatives to defend in Hanger Hill ward, which includes the notorious Hanger Lane gyratory system where the North Circular Road crosses the Western Avenue.  The London Underground stations at Hanger Lane, Park Royal, North Ealing and West Acton serve the ward.

Hanger Hill turned from a safe Conservative ward into a three-way marginal in 2022, with the Lib Dems polling 33%, the Conservatives 31% and Labour 23%; the ward's three seats split one to the Lib Dems and two to the Conservatives.  It's part of the safe-Labour parliamentary seat of Ealing Central and Acton represented since 2015 by Rupa Huq (sister of Connie Huq and sister-in-law of Charlie Brooker).  Gregory Stafford had originally been elected here in 2014, transferring here from the former Cleveland ward where he had won a 2007 by-election; his former ward colleagues included Joy Morrissey, who left the council after she was elected in 2019 as the Conservative MP for Beaconsfield.

We stay within the Ealing Central and Acton constituency to consider South Acton ward, which is in the top 100 wards in England and Wales for households in shared ownership - usually an indicator of some recent housebuilding.  This ward covers the core of Acton, and is served by the Underground station at Acton Town together with the Overground stations at Acton Central and South Acton.  Also here is the London Transport Musuem Depot, where Transport for London store exhibits that don't fit in their main museum building at Covent Garden: it is occasionally open to the public.  Outgoing councillor Callum Anderson was in his first term; he was safely elected in 2022 with the Labour slate polling 48%, against 19% for the Greens and 15% for the Conservatives.

In the north-west corner of the borough we find another safe Labour ward, Northolt Mandeville.  This is centred on Northolt Underground station, which has High Speed 2 tunnels currently being bored underneath it.  This ward is more clearly Outer London and still had large amounts of open space until after the Second World War: for example, the Racecourse Estate is named after a former racecourse which was built on in the 1950s.  Since it's October, we should also mention that Northolt was also the purported location of the Hallowe'en 1992 "live" broadcast of <em>Ghostwatch</em>, which the BBC have never dared to repeat.  In 2022 Northolt Mandeville gave the Labour slate a 55-26 lead over the Conservatives; the ward is part of the safe-Labour parliamentary seat of Ealing North, whose second-term Labour MP James Murray is now on the Treasury team.  Deirdre Costigan was first elected here in 2018.

All three by-elections have attracted a large field of at least six candidates.  In Northolt Mandeville the defending Labour candidate is Dominic Moffitt, who is a senior parliamentary assistant.  The Conservative candidate Andrew Bailey contested Perivale ward in 2022; he has a background in engineering.  Also standing for Northolt Mandeville are Natalia Kubica for the Greens, Pedro da Conceicao who was an 18-year-old independent candidate for Ealing Southall in the recent general election and has the Lib Dem nomination here, Conrad Lewandowski for Reform UK and Eltayeb Omima for the Workers Party of Britain.

South Acton ward has a total of eight candidates standing.  Here the Labour defence is led by Katie Douglas.  The Green candidate is Andrew Walkley, who is an English teacher and businessman.  Standing for the Conservatives is Kristian Mower, who does a lot of volunteer work as a consultant to the charity sector.  Completing the South Acton ballot are Timothy Hughes for the Lib Dems, independent candidate Julie Carter who finished in eighth and last place as an independent candidate for Ealing Central and Acton in July, David Hofman for the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition, Lucas Davies Herbst for the Workers Party of Britain, and Marco Manassero for Reform UK.

Finally, the Conservative defence in the marginal Hanger Hill ward is led by Sean Hanrahan, who works in the charity sector and contested Northfield ward in the 2022 Ealing elections.  Jonathan Oxley, one of the unsuccessful Lib Dem candidates for Hanger Hill in 2022, is back for another go; Oxley has previously served as a Conservative Ealing councillor in 2006-10, while his professional career has included spells as a partner at PwC and as interim chief executive of Ofcom.  The Labour candidate is Guneet Singh Malik.  Also standing in Hanger Hill are Kate Crossland for the Greens, Fabio Pukaj for Reform UK and Wagdi Thabit for the Workers Party of Britain.

Weybridge St George's Hill</h2>

Elmbridge council, Surrey; caused respectively by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Chester Chandler and by the death of the Conservative councillor Charu Sood.

The Runnymede and Weybridge constituency did manage to re-elect its Conservative MP, quite comfortably.  Ben Spencer is starting his second term of office; going into July's general election he was deputy chairman of the Conservative Party, and he is now a junior shadow minister focusing on mental health.  Which is appropriate, as Spencer was a doctor specialising in mental health before his election to Parliament in 2019.

<h2>Addlestone South</h2>

Runnymede council, Surrey; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Jonathan Wilson.

We now cross the River Wey from Weybridge and come to Addlestone, another of the prosperous Surrey commuter towns within the M25 that never made into Greater London.  Addlestone South ward covers the southern half of the town including the offices of Runnymede council, a borough created in 1974 from the merger of the former Chertsey and Egham urban districts.

I mentioned in the previous section that Runnymede and Weybridge still has a Conservative MP, but Runnymede is no longer a Conservative-run council.  The Tories lost control here in 2023 after 25 years of majority control, and further losses in 2024 made their administration untenable.  Runnymede's council leadership is now a four-way jobshare between the leaders of the Labour group (8 councillors), the Lib Dem group (6), the Runnymede Independent Residents Group (6) and the Greens (3), who are supported by the two independent councillors for Englefield Green East ward; the Conservatives (12 seats plus this vacancy) and the three independent councillors for Ottershaw ward are in opposition.  Following the loss of Reigate and Banstead in 2024, Surrey county council is now the only local government district with a Conservative majority in Surrey - whatever definition of Surrey you use.

The Conservatives still hold the Addlestone division on Surrey county council and all three seats in Addlestone South ward, although this May's election was very close: the Conservatives held off Labour by 605 votes to 596, a majority of nine votes.  In percentage terms that was 42-41.  One of the other councillors for this ward is the Conservative group leader Peter Snow, who might not remember that particular election count as "just a bit of fun".

This tiny majority makes Addlestone South a difficult by-election for the Conservatives to defend following the death in August of Jonathan Wilson, at the appallingly early age of 38.  Wilson was first elected to the council in 2006 when he was a 22-year-old student at Royal Holloway, representing Egham Hythe ward; after being defeated there in 2018, he transferred to Addlestone South in 2019.

Defending this seat for the Conservatives is Steve Eldridge, who worked for Runnymede council until June as a communications officer.  Labour have reselected Elaine Percival, who lost out here by nine votes in May and by 80 votes last year.  Also standing are Jenny Coulon for the Lib Dems and Jess Ward for the Green Party.

<h2>Wivelsfield</h2>

Lewes council, East Sussex; caused by the resignation of Green Party councillor William Coupland.

Our tour of England now takes us to Sussex and to Wivelsfield.  This is a rural parish covering the countryside to the south-east of Haywards Heath and the north-east of Burgess Hill, both of which are in the county of West Sussex whereas Wivelsfield parish is in East Sussex.  The ward does not include Wivelsfield railway station on the Brighton line, which is actually in Burgess Hill; Wivelsfield itself is no longer the largest settlement within the ward, that being Wivelsfield Green.  Some new housing on the edges of both Burgess Hill and Haywards Heath has also spilled over into the ward in recent years, and this shows up clearly in the census return: in 2021 Wivelsfield made the top 70 wards in England and Wales for households in shared ownership (5.0%).

This being East rather than West Sussex, the local authority here is Lewes council which turned in an astonishing result in the 2023 local elections: the Greens became the largest party with 17 councillors, the Lib Dems won 15, Labour won 9, and the Conservatives - who had been the largest party here in 2019 - were completely wiped out.  A Green-Labour coalition is running the show.  Wivelsfield was one of the Conservative losses last year, with the Greens coming from a poor third place in 2019 to defeat the Conservatives by 53-37.  The new councillor William Coupland has stepped down after a year in office on health grounds, having recently suffered a stroke.

The Tories do still represent Wivelsfield ward at other levels of government.  They narrowly held the Chailey division of East Sussex county council in 2021 against a Green challenge, and Wivelsfield is part of the Conservative-held East Grinstead and Uckfield parliamentary seat.  Mims Davies was comfortably elected there in July against split opposition to win her fourth term of office in her third constituency: she was originally elected for Eastleigh in 2015, before transferring to Mid Sussex in 2019.

Defending this seat for the Green Party is Sue Morris, an accountant who sits on Wivelsfield parish council.  The Conservatives have selected Sarah Webster, who runs a recruitment business and is chair of Horsted Keynes parish council; she was their Parliamentary candidate for Brighton Pavilion three months ago.  Nadine Stothard completes the ballot paper for the Lib Dems.

<h2>Heene</h2>

Worthing council, West Sussex; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Richard Mulholland.

For our other Sussex by-election it's back to the Worthing seafront, which this column visited three weeks ago in (yet again) previewing the town's Marine ward.  That by-election was a Conservative gain from Labour, a much-needed boost for the Worthing Conservatives after Sir Peter Bottomley MP suffered the embarrassment in July of becoming the only Father of the House ever to lose re-election.

Many of the remarks I made in the Marine ward preview last month also apply to the next-door ward of Heene, which covers much of West Worthing.  Heene ward runs southwards from West Worthing railway station to the seafront, and lies directly west of Worthing town centre.  It has an unusually old age profile for an urban ward, making the top 50 wards in England and Wales for residents aged 85 or over (7.4%); that's not very typical of Worthing, which is much less of an elephant's graveyard than some other Sussex seaside towns.

Heene ward now has Labour representatives at all levels of governemnt.  The former Labour council leader Beccy Cooper became the MP for Worthing West in July (provoking the Marine ward by-election which Labour lost last month), Labour gained the two West Sussex county council divisions covering Heene ward in 2021 (Worthing Pier and Worthing West), and Heene ward itself has voted Labour at every Worhing council election since 2018 - before then it voted Conservative.  In May Labour led the Conservatives here by 57-26, a slightly larger lead than the 56-31 lead which the Conservatives recently overturned in Marine ward.

Richard Mulholland was a Labour councillor for Heene from 2018 until his resignation in August, for undisclosed reasons.  Defending his seat in the resulting by-election is Anthony Squires, who contested the town's Salvington ward in May.  The Conservatives have selected Luke Houghton, who has a background in the Prison Service and the police.  Also on the ballot are Kate Thornton for the Green Party and Trudy Starling for the Liberal Democrats.

<h2>Shirley</h2>

Southampton council, Hampshire; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Satvir Kaur.

https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E12AQERoeSrFoTNeg/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/0/1707894995051?e=1733356800&v=beta&t=1GWjHT6QFxssQNlmudhzaSvWF5A8N7wdRrC3TAC_SZ4

Out tour of England concludes in Shirley, a north-western suburb of Southampton.  Shirley's old town centre lies on the main road going north-west from Southampton city centre towards Romsey; the Shirley ward extends north and east from here to take in Southampton Common and the large Southampton General Hospital.  In 1980 a boy called Rishi Sunak was born at that hospital, and the pharmacy which Sunak's mother ran for many years lies just outside the boundary of Shirley ward.  The presence of Southampton General Hospital means that Shirley ward is within the top 25 wards in England and Wales for those working in the health and social work sector (26.8% of the workforce).

Shirley was once, very briefly, the centre of its own local government unit: the Shirley and Fremantle Urban District was created in 1894, and then abolished just a year later when its area was annexed by Southampton.  The modern Shirley ward of Southampton council took on its current boundaries in 2002, and has trended towards the left over the last 22 years: Shirley ward consistently voted Conservative up to 2010, then changed to consistently voting Labour from 2011.  In May Labour held the ward with 40% of the vote against 25% for the Conservatives (an unusually poor score) and 20% for the Liberal Democrats (an unusually good score).

Since 1950 Southampton has been divided into two parliamentary seats wich are named after rivers: the Itchen seat is eastern Southampton, while the Test constituency covers the western half of the city including Shirley.  Test has been in Labour hands since 1997 when it was gained by Alan Whitehead, who had previously been leader of Southampton council and had made three previous failed attempts on the seat.  Whitehead retired at this summer's general election and successfully passed his seat on to another former Southampton council leader.  Satvir Kaur had represented Shirley ward on the council since 2011, and she became leader of the opposition Labour group in 2021 and then leader of the council when Labour took control of Southampton in 2022.  Kaur was the first Sikh woman to lead a council in the UK.

With Satvir Kaur off to Westminster, the defending Labour candidate in the Southampton council by-election to replace her is Victoria Ugwoeme: she is described as a community activist and radio preesenter, she is associated with the GMB union, and she is looking to make a quick return to the council after losing her seat to the Conservatives in Woolston ward in May.  The Conservatives have reselected Andrew Hetherton who is their regular candidate for this ward; he runs a consulting firm specialising in property taxation.  Also returning from May's election is Lib Dem candidate George Percival, who is a full-time firefighter.  Completing the Shirley ward ballot paper are Barrie Margetts for the Green Party, Maggie Fricker for the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition, and independent candidate Andrew Pope who was a Southampton Labour councillor some years ago.
