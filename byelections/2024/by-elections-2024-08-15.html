How's your summer been?  For Andrew's Previews it's been relaxing with not a lot of by-elections to cover.  June and July can be busy months for local polls, but this year nearly all of the summer by-elections got combined with the undercard of the Westminster general election on 4th July.  Apart from three polls on 18th July, this column has been on a hiatus since then, trying to get to grips with the radically-changed political landscape in which we now find ourselves.  It's like learning a new language.

Well, we have a busy autumn ahead of us on the local by-election front.  At the time of writing my list of vacancies has 63 entries on it, of which 20 are caused by newly-elected MPs (19 Labour and 1 Conservative) resigning their previous council seats.  By-elections to replace them will be a feature of the next couple of months.

The kids are already back at school in Scotland, which is the focus for our first council by-election today.  Like much of our TV in August, it's a repeat: for the third time in 18 months we travel to the western edge of the Ochil Hills for a by-election in the Stirling council ward of Dunblane and Bridge of Allan.  The Allan here refers to the Allan Water, a river which rises in western Perthshire and flows south through the ward to meet the Forth north of Stirling.  The Allan is followed fairly closely by the Stirling-Perth railway line, and rather less closely by the M9 motorway, which terminates at Keir Roundabout to become the A9 dual carriageway.
</p><p>
Also down in the valley here we find a university.  Bridge of Allan is home to the campus of the University of Stirling, one of the plate-glass universities founded in the 1960s.  Stirling is known for excellence in sport, and the campus' Olympic swimming pool has produced the first Briton to win four medals at a single Olympic Games.  Duncan Scott, who grew up in nearby Alloa, took home a gold and three silver medals from the swimming pool of the 2021 Tokyo Olympics; Scott also had two silver medals to his name from Rio, and he has returned from the recent Paris Olympics with a second gold (in the 4 x 200 metres freestyle relay) and a sixth silver medal to bring his total medal haul to eight.  Among British Olympians, that is level with Sir Bradley Wiggins; only Sir Jason Kenny has won more Olympic medals.
</p><p>
The Stirling campus itself is located within Stirling North ward and is just outside the boundary of this ward, but Bridge of Allan itself is very much under the university's influence.  Dunblane, a few miles to north, is another matter.  This is the location of the UK's northernmost electrified railway station, with regular trains to Stirling and beyond to both Edinburgh and Glasgow; as a result, Dunblane is very much a commuter town.  It was part of Perthshire until 1975, unlike Bridge of Allan which was part of Stirlingshire.
</p><p>
It's impossible to mention Dunblane without recalling the terrible events of 28 years ago, when a man whom I shall not name walked into the gymnasium of the town's primary school with four handguns.  By the time he took his own life, 16 pupils and one of their teachers had lost theirs.  The Dunblane massacre led directly to the UK parliament enacting some of the tightest gun-control laws in the world, and thankfully this country has not seen a school shooting since.
</p><p>
Two of the Dunblane primary school pupils who survived that day were Jamie and Andy Murray, who would go on to become the brightest stars of UK tennis in the 21st century.  Jamie Murray has seven grand-slam doubles titles to his name; in a professional tennis career which ended with his retirement at the recent Paris Olympics Andy won three grand-slam singles titles (two Wimbledons and one US Open), two Olympic gold medals, a metal hip and a knighthood.  Sir Andy's marriage to Kim Sears in 2015, at Dunblane Cathedral, was described as Scotland's wedding of the year.  Sir Andy Murray and his family have their main home in England now, but the Murrays still have strong links with Dunblane: Andy and Kim own Cromlix House, a five-star country house hotel within this ward which has recently been renovated.  As a high-profile figure, Sir Andy Murray has previously drawn public attention for putting his political opinions on social media, which is entirely his prerogative; how he votes is, of course, between him and the ballot box.
</p><p>
The ballot boxes in Dunblane and Bridge of Allan have consistently told interesting stories, which this column has had the chance to tell on more than one previous occasion.  The ward was created in 2007, with boundaries which originally included Stirling University.  Its first election returned one councillor each from the Conservatives, the SNP, Labour and the Lib Dems - who won their seat with strong transfers from the Greens.  In 2012 the Lib Dem vote collapsed and the Greens gained their seat.
</p><p>
Boundary changes for the 2017 election, which removed the university campus, strengthened the Conservative position in the ward.  That was a good year for the Scottish Conservatives, and they topped the poll in the redrawn Dunblane and Bridge of Allan with 44% of the first preferences which was good for two out of four seats.  The SNP had 28% and held their seat.  In the race for the final seat Labour started on 12% and the Greens on 10%, but the Greens picked up transfers from all over the place - particularly from the SNP surplus - to hold their seat.  Labour lost their seat to the Conservatives.  If the SNP had balanced their candidates better and the Greens had been eliminated, the Green transfers would probably have elected Labour rather than a second SNP or (if there had been one) a third Conservative candidate.
</p><p>
The most recent Scottish local elections in 2022 were not such a good Conservative year.  The Tories still topped the poll across Dunblane and Bridge of Allan, but the Conservative vote fell to 30% and that cost them their second seat.  The SNP and the Greens easily held their seats with 26% and 16% respectively, and the final seat went back to Labour who started on 12% and picked up strong transfers from the Lib Dems at the end of the count.  All four outgoing councillors had stood for another term.  Douglas Dodds (C&zwnj;), Graham Houston (SNP) and Alasdair Tollemache (Grn) were successfully re-elected, while former Conservative councillor Alastair Majury sought re-election as an independent candidate: he polled 5% of the first preferences and was eliminated in eighth place, losing his seat to Labour's Ewan Dillon.
</p><p>
In December 2021 the ward's SNP councillor Graham Houston died at the age of 74.  The resulting by-election was held on 16th March 2023, and was the last poll held in Scotland before Humza Yousaf took over as First Minister and leader of the SNP.  By this time the Scottish National Party vote was clearly on the slide both nationally and locally.  A single-seat faceoff between the Conservatives and the SNP would have been very close in May 2022; it wasn't close in March 2023.  The Conservatives led on the first count with 41% of the vote against 27% for the SNP and 13% for Labour; once all other parties had been eliminated, the SNP lost their seat to the Conservatives' Robin Kleinman by a 56-44 margin.
</p><p>
In January 2024 the Conservatives had to turn from attack to defence following the resignation of Douglas Dodds, who was the Provost of Stirling and had represented this ward since 2017.  He cited personal and health reasons for his resignation.  The Tories needed to hold this seat to remain as the largest party on Stirling council, and they did so comfortably: in January's by-election the first-preference votes were 38% for the Conservatives, 23% for the SNP and an improved 20% for Labour, with a head-to-head lead of 57-43 for the Conservatives over the SNP in the final count.
</p><p>
Both of those by-elections were part of an SNP losing streak: Scotland's governing party failed to win a single election of any kind between a November 2022 by-election in Moray and the July 2024 Westminster election.  Perhaps this was indicative of just how badly the Nationalists were about to perform in that election.  Dunblane and Bridge of Allan ward is part of the Stirling and Strathallan constituency, which turned in a stunning gain for Labour on a swing of over 22% from the SNP.  Nationalist frontbencher and former MEP Alyn Smith lost his seat to Labour's Chris Kane.  The MSP for Clackmannanshire and Dunblane Keith Brown, a Falklands veteran who has been depute leader of the SNP since 2018, can't have been too happy at that result.
</p><p>
Chris Kane MP came to Westminster from a career in local politics.  Since 2022 he has been the leader of Stirling council, which has been run by Labour in some form or other since 2012; Labour currently have a minority administration, with Conservative support, despite being the third-largest party on the council.  The 2022 elections to Stirling council returned eight SNP councillors, seven Conservatives, six Labour, one Green and an independent.
</p><p>
One month after their impressive Westminster gain, Stirling Labour now have to turn from attack to defence to replace Ewan Dillon, who was elected here in May 2022 when he was 19 years old.  Unfortunately, this by-election is out of the Councillors Behaving Badly file, because later in May 2022 Dillon's home was raided by police who found 58 images of child sex abuse on his phone.  Dillon quit the Labour party but stayed on as a councillor until March 2024, missing two chances to leave the scene at a double by-election which would have saved time and money for everyone involved.  Following a guilty plea at Stirling Sheriff Court in May, Dillon was sentenced in July to 270 hours of unpaid work and placed on the sex offenders register.  He's still only 21, and he has a long ruined life ahead of him.
</p><p>
Labour have an uphill struggle to defend this by-election following third-place finishes at the two previous Dunblane and Bridge of Allan by-elections.  On both of those occasions the defated Labour candidate was David Wilson, a local government worker and UNISON officer who will be hoping to make it third time lucky.  Also hoping to be lucky is Stuart McLuckie of the Conservatives, who graduated in law from Stirling University in 2020 and contested Bannockburn ward at the last Stirling council elections in 2022.  The SNP candidate this time is John Watson, a retired engineer and consultant who contested Trossachs and Teith ward two years ago.  Also standing are Andrew Adam for the Scottish Greens (he was their parliamentary candidate here last month and came close to saving his deposit), Dick Moerman for the Lib Dems (who stood in both previous by-elections), and former Conservative ward councillor Alastair Majury standing as an independent.

<h2>Hillrise</h2>

Islington council, London; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Ollie Steadman.

Our second by-election today is in another ward where we have seen a previous local by-election this year.  We've come to Inner London, although only just so as we are in the northernmost ward of the London Borough of Islington.  As the ward name might suggest this is a hilly area.  The western corner of Hillrise ward is the Archway Bridge which carries Hornsey Lane - once the northern boundary of the County of London - over the A1 Archway Road, while the eastern corner is at Crouch Hill station on the Gospel Oak-Barking line of the London Overground.  The terraces and blocks of flats in between have high levels of social housing, and Hillrise makes the top 100 wards in England and Wales for those of mixed race (7.7%), residents born in Cyprus or Malta (1.0%), residents who identify only as Irish (2.4%) or Northern Irish (0.4%), and for employment in the arts, entertainment and recreation sector (5.9%).

Hillrise ward is centred on Elthorne Park, which is home to the Philip Noel-Baker Peace Garden.  The eponymous Noel-Baker is, to date, the only person to win both an Olympic medal and a Nobel Prize.  His medal was a silver medal in the 1,500 metres at the 1920 Antwerp games; many years later, as secretary of state for Commonwealth relations in the Attlee government, he was the minister reponsible for organising the 1948 Summer Olympics in London.  As the name of the garden might suggest Noel-Baker's Nobel was for Peace, awarded in 1959 "for his longstanding contribution to the cause of disarmament and peace", to quote from the official citation.

Philip Noel-Baker's passion for nuclear disarmament is shared by the current MP for this area.  Jeremy Bernard Corbyn has been the MP for Islington North since 1983, when he defeated two outgoing ex-Labour MPs who had both defected to the SDP: John Grant (whose Islington Central seat had been abolished in boundary changes and was the official SDP candidate) and Michael O'Halloran (the outgoing Islington North MP, standing as an Independent Labour candidate).  Corbyn was leader of the Labour party at the general elections of 2017 and 2019, both of which were lost - first narrowly, then embarrassingly.  In 2020 Corbyn was succeeded as party leader by Sir Keir Starmer, and shortly afterwards he lost the Labour whip for antisemitism within the party on his watch.  Despite this there is still a lot of love for Corbyn among his electors: in last month's general election Jeremy Corbyn sought an eleventh term of office as MP for Islington North as an independent candidate, and he defeated the official Labour candidate Praful Nagrund by 49-34.

It remains to be seen whether that result is a flash in the pan or whether it might point to a Labour downturn in Islington, which has traditionally been a very safe area for the party.  The 2022 Islington council elections returned 48 Labour councillors with an opposition of just three Greens, and Hillrise ward is very much in the Labour column with the Labour slate enjoying a 62-21 lead over the Green Party.  Failing to trouble the scorers much in Hillrise last time was one Mark Pack, the national president of the Liberal Democrats, who was joint acting leader of the party for much of 2020 following the defeat of Jo Swinson at the 2019 general election.  Pack finished seventh out of twelve candidates at the top of the Lib Dem slate, which polled 10%.

Top of the poll in Hillrise ward in 2022 was Labour candidate Dave Poyser, a Blue Badge tour guide and podcaster who had been mayor of Islington in 2018-19.  Poyser stood down from the council in 2024 triggering a by-election, which was held on the undercard of the London Mayor and Assembly elections in May: this was won by Labour candidate Ollie Steadman with a 63-24 lead over the Greens, almost no change from 2022.  Steadman lasted just two months before handing in his resignation for undisclosed personal reasons, prompting the second Hillrise ward by-election of the year.

Standing for Labour this time is Shreya Nanda, an economist and senior fellow at the Social Market Foundation who was apparently on the longlist to be Labour's parliamentary candidate in Islington North last month; she didn't get that job, but this might be an easier task.  Unusually for someone whose surname begins with an N, she is top of the alphabetical ballot paper.  The Greens' Alex Nettle, a sustainable transport planner, is back for another go after his second-place finish in May's by-election.  Also on the ballot are two independent candidates, Maxim Parr-Reid (a tutor) and Alison Stoecker (an educator and therapist standing on a Corbynite ticket), together with Imogen Wall for the Lib Dems.

<h2>Aberbargoed and Bargoed</h2>

Caerphilly council, Gwent; caused by the death of Labour councillor Dianne Price.

For our final by-election today we travel to the Rhymney Valley in south Wales.  The towns of Aberbargoed and Bargoed face each other across the valley, with Bargoed to the west and Aberbargoed to the east.  That means that until 1974 they were in separate counties, with Bargoed in Glamorgan and Aberbargoed in Monmouthshire; and arguably they were in separate countries, because the Acts of Henry VIII which added Wales to his kingdom were ambiguous as to whether Monmouthshire was part of England or Wales.  Until the 1970s legislation which was intended to apply only to Wales normally referred to "Wales and Monmouthshire".  Appropriately enough, the name of Bargoed comes from <em>bargod</em>, which is a Welsh word for "boundary".

The two towns are both classic Valleys communities which were created by the coal industry, although Bargoed did have another industry.  From 1949 to 1999 there was an Austin car factory here, which provided employment for ex-miners who had had to leave the coal industry after developing the lung disease pneumoconiosis.  In the 2021 census Aberbargoed and Bargoed made the top 80 wards in England and Wales for long-term sickness or disability (10.7%); it was also in the top 30 for those of no religion (61.3%), something which is a common feature of the census return for the Valleys: of the top 20 "no religion" figures in the 2021 census, 15 are wards in the Valleys (the other five are all in Brighton or Bristol).  There is fairly easy access to employment further down the Rhymney valley from Bargoed and Gilfach Fargoed railway stations, from which regular trains link the area to Caerphilly and Cardiff.

We've mentioned Olympians in the other Previews this week, so we should pay tribute to Lauren Price who attended Bargoed's secondary school, Heolddu Comprehensive School.  Price was one of those people who could have excelled in any sport, and she competed in netball, football and kickboxing while at school.  In football, Price was on the Cardiff City team which won the Welsh Women's Premier League in 2012-13 and won two caps for Wales; she then turned to boxing, competing at middleweight, and won gold medals at the 2018 Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast and the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo.  Lauren Price wasn't boxing in Paris this summer because she has turned professional: in May she became the first Welsh world champion in women's boxing, defeating American boxer Jessica McCaskill in Cardiff to win the WBA, IBO and <em>Ring</em> magazine welterweight titles.

By contrast, one of this ward's most famous sons is best known for what happened to him after death.  Glyndwr Michael was born in Aberbargoed in 1907; in his thirties he was homeless and living on the streets of London, where he died in January 1943 in St Pancras Hospital from eating rat poison.  At the time the St Pancras coroner was looking for a suitable volunteer for Operation Mincemeat, a hare-brained scheme from British intelligence to lure German forces away from Sicily prior to the Allied invasion.  The idea was to plant documents for a fake invasion of Greece on a dead body purported to be that of a British officer, and have the body wash up in neutral Spain from where the documents should find their way into the hands of German intelligence.  Ingesting rat poison causes the lungs to fill with fluid, so Michael's body fitted the bill of someone who looked like they had drowned in the sea.  His corpse duly washed up on the Spanish shore in April dressed as "Major William Martin, Royal Marines", under which name he was buried in Huelva with full military honours.  Martin was identified in 1996 as Glyndwr Michael, and Michael's name has been added to the war memorial in Aberbargoed under the inscription "Y Dyn Na Fu Erioed" - "the man who never was".

The old Glamorgan-Monmouthshire split is still reflected in the boundaries for Senedd elections, where Bargoed is part of the Caerphilly constituency represented by Hefin David (another former pupil of Heolddu Comprehensive School) whereas Aberbargoed is in the Islwyn constituency represented by Rhianon Passmore.  David and Passmore are both Labour MSs.  At the last Senedd elections in 2021 Caerphilly was contested by Plaid Cymru candidate Delyth Jewell, who lost the constituency but was elected as a regional MS for South Wales East and susequently became Plaid's deputy leader.

For the 2026 election the Senedd's electoral system will be reformed, with the split between constituency and regional MSs done away with: instead Wales will be divided into 16 constituencies each electing six MSs by proportional representation.  The plan is to draw these constituencies by pairing up the 32 Westminster constituencies for Wales which were introduced at the July 2024 general election.  Those lines transferred both Aberbargoed and Bargoed into the Blaenau Gwent and Rhymney parliamentary seat, which safely returned the Labour candidate Nick Smith who had previously served four terms as MP for Blaenau Gwent.  In July he enjoyed the highest majority in Wales with a lead of 12,183 over Plaid Cymru, which may have been aided by Reform UK not being on the ballot here: their candidate for the seat withdrew his nomination at the last moment due to reposting racist stuff on social media.

The local authority here is Caerphilly council, which has had a Labour majority since 2012.  The 2022 Welsh local elections saw the Labour seat count fall from 50 to 45, partially as a result of boundary changes which reduced the size of the council from 73 to 69.  Two of the four council seats which disappeared were in Aberbargoed and Bargoed: they had previously been separate wards returning two and three councillors respectively, but the combined ward only has three councillors.  Plaid Cymru are the main opposition on Caerphilly council, and local elections in Aberbargoed and Bargoed are primarily Labour veruss Plaid fights with other parties rarely standing.  Labour have won every local election in the area this century, but the 2022 result was fairly close with a 47-39 lead for the Labour slate.

So Labour have some work to do to defend this by-election following the death in April of long-serving councillor Dianne Price.  Price nearly made it to 20 years on Caerphilly council, having been first elected for Bargoed in June 2004; she was mayor of Caerphilly in 2016-17, and before that she was mayor of Bargoed in 1997-98.  For 18 years she worked as the manager of a local shoe shop.

Defending for Labour is Chris Bissex-Foster, who works at a further education college in Merthyr Tydfil.  She was runner-up in this ward at the 2022 Caerphilly council elections - when she was top of the Plaid Cymru slate.  The official Plaid candidate Joshua McCarthy is a student reading journalism at the University of South Wales.  One other candidate has come forward: he is Mark Thomas, standing for the Green Party.
