<!-- Andrew's Previews - May 2020 -->

Hello everyone.  Hopefully you're all keeping well, living less and stressing more in these lean times.  There are, of course, no elections to preview for some time to come; we'll discuss that in a bit more detail later on, but first I wanted to tell one of the stories I've been saving for the right moment to come up.  For May's edition of Andrew's Previews, let me take you to the Home Counties to discuss a young man, with a luckless life, who was taken from us far too soon.

<em>Bagshot</em>

The quiz show <em>University Challenge</em> has been running for a very long time indeed.  Last month the show's 49th series, the 26th hosted by Jeremy Paxman (which is already three more series than than Bamber Gascoigne did) came to its conclusion with a win for the talented team from Imperial College, London.  In this social media age <em>University Challenge</em> often introduces some stars to our TV screens.  This year's undoubted star was Brandon Blackwell, an Imperial computer science student, who is originally from New York City and whose American brashness (as the viewers saw it) extended to having his <em>first name</em> printed on the set.

For those in the serious quiz community, Brandon's performance was not a flash in the pan.  Your columnist was there at the 2016 Quiz Olympiad in Athens when Brandon won the "speed quiz" event: 100 multiple-choice general knowledge questions in a ridiculous time limit like 2 minutes.  I was nowhere near, of course.

If you want more quiz action like this, you're out of luck.  We could have some time to wait for the fiftieth series of <em>University Challenge</em>.   As with so many other things, Covid has driven a coach and horses through both the academic year and the programme's filming schedule - which is more controversial than you might think.  Jeremy Paxman likes to remind teams that "the rules are as constant as the Northern Star", but this isn't strictly true...

Let me wind back to the evening of 1st March 2002, and a meeting room at the Students' Union in Warwick University.  I remember the date: it was my birthday, and I was there for the selection meeting for Warwick's team in the 32nd series of <em>University Challenge</em>.  The format was simple enough: 100 rather testing general knowledge questions, four places up for grabs.  I got 45 of the questions right, which put me in a tie for third to fifth place in the room.  One of the other people in that bracket had been on the previous year's team (which didn't make the televised stages) and that put a question mark over his eligibility, so I was in.  Being on the winning side of that slightly dodgy tiebreak changed my life, because it got me into serious-level quiz.

In those days the filming schedule for <em>University Challenge</em> was split over two academic years: the first two rounds were recorded in June and July, the quarter-finals onwards in the autumn.  At that meeting in March 2002, it was painstakingly explained to us that to be eligible for the team we would have to be at the university in the following academic year.  Finalists, in other words, need not apply.

Some finalists did, however, apply under the radar; and probably nobody would have cared too much except that one of them won.  Wind forward six years to the 38th series, recorded in 2008 and broadcast in 2008-09, which was a high-scoring one.  Particularly so for the team from Corpus Christi College, Oxford, spectacularly led by team captain and Latin literature student Gail Trimble.  Corpus' overall score of 1,510 points in five matches was a record for the Paxman era; in the quarter-finals they annihilated Exeter University by 350 points to 15, with Trimble scoring an astonishing fifteen starter questions.  Sam Kay, Lauren Schwartzman and James Marsden were also fine players.   Corpus were hot favourites for the final against a typically strong Manchester University team, whom they despatched by 275 points to 190.  The trophy was handed over to Miss Trimble by the poet Wendy Cope who made some nice remarks, it was goodbye from Jeremy Paxman (goodbye) and that was that for Series 38.

Except it wasn't.  On the weekend after the final went out in February 2009 (some months after its recording), the <em>Observer</em> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/mar/01/gail-trimble-university-challenge-sam-kay">dropped a bombshell</a>.  Not about Gail Trimble, but about her teammate Sam Kay, who (it turned out) was no longer a student at Corpus.  Kay had completed his final year of a chemistry degree in the 2007-08 academic year; he had intended to continue for another year by applying for a DPhil course, but that had fallen through and by February 2009 he was working as an accountant.  Controversy ensued.  The <em>Observer</em> gave the news to the BBC, who passed the hot potato to ITV Granada (who, for complicated rights reasons, still make the series to this day).  Granada quickly came to a decision: Corpus were disqualified, and Manchester University (as the losing finalists) were declared the series winners.

It's a decision that was controversial then and is still controversial now.  Goodness knows what it meant for poor Sam Kay.  Regrettably social media abuse is par for the course for TV quiz contestants these days, but having your reputation trashed by one of the more respectable Sunday newspapers is another level altogether.

Frontline politicians, of course, get that sort of treatment all the time; and it's interesting to see that Sam Kay fairly quickly turned to politics after leaving university.  He had gone back home to his native Surrey, developed his career in accountancy and become active in the Liberal Democrats.  Kay first turns up in my archives in May 2017, as the Lib Dem candidate for the Bagshot, Windlesham and Chobham division of Surrey county council.  May 2017 was a good set of elections for the Conservatives, and while Kay's 17% of the vote was good enough for second place it was nowhere near troubling Conservative county councillor Mike Goodman.

For the May 2019 election Kay was selected on the Liberal Democrat slate for the Bagshot ward of Surrey Heath district.  Bagshot is a village on the old road from London towards Southampton and the south-west (now the A30), and there are still some coaching inns here.  The village is attractively placed in the Green Belt and has easy connections to the M3 motorway.  The north of the ward towards the county boundary is woodland and good mountain biking territory; more professional sport can be found at the England rugby team's training base.  There are even royal connections: the mansion house of Bagshot Park is in the hands of the Royal Family, and is currently occupied by the Earl of Wessex and his family.

Bagshot is part of the Surrey Heath local government district, which also covers such comfortable places as Camberley and Frimley.  Surrey Heath has had a Conservative majority since the 1970s reorganisation, and it's also a secure political home for a high-profile MP with his own embarrassing quiz show story to tell...

On the other hand, Bagshot ward has a Liberal tradition; it returned a full slate of Lib Dems in 2003, and even in the unpropitious year of 2015 the Liberal Democrats managed to gain a seat here.

There were revised boundaries for the 2019 local elections, which were appalling for the Conservatives in Surrey.  The party nearly lost its majority on Surrey Heath district, crashing from 36 councillors out of possible 40 to 18 out of a possible 35, with ten Lib Dems in second place.  That Liberal Democrat caucus included two members from Bagshot ward, where Sam Kay beat a running-mate higher in the alphabet to finish <a href="https://www.surreyheath.gov.uk/sites/default/files/documents/council/Elections/Borough%20Council%20results%202019.pdf">top of the poll</a>.  Doing that is usually an indication of a strong personal vote.

Sadly, as happened on <em>University Challenge</em> ten years earlier, Sam Kay didn't get to enjoy his triumph for long.  On 4 January 2020, he died in Frimley Park hospital after a short illness.  He was just 33 years old.

Rest in peace, Sam.

<h4>Future by-elections</h4>

The Surrey Heath Liberal Democrats made no move to call the resulting Bagshot by-election over the winter, and Sam Kay's seat is now one of more than a hundred council vacancies which lie in abeyance.  In this futureless present state which we live in it's difficult to look forward; but these vacancies are eventually going to have to be sorted out.  Here's the plan for doing so.

All English local by-elections have been deferred by legislation to 6th May 2021, when the local elections that should have happened this month will be combined with those that are due next year.  This will be kept under review and by-elections may be restarted if it's safe to do so before then.

In Wales all local by-elections have been deferred to a period between 1st February 2021 and the middle of April.  There are no scheduled local elections in Wales next year but Senedd Cymru will be up for election, together with the postponed elections for Wales' four police and crime commissioners.

The rules are different in Scotland, where the returning officer can schedule by-elections entirely on his or her own initiative.  There is normally a three-month deadline for filling Scottish council vacancies, but that has been waived for the time being.  The returning officers for Aberdeenshire and West Lothian have pencilled in by-elections for Thursday 1st October 2020 which look like being the next electoral action, although there is power to postpone these if things haven't died down sufficiently in time.  The next scheduled ordinary elections in Scotland are for the Scottish Parliament in 2021.

The Electoral Office for Northern Ireland was going through a quiet period anyway, as the next elections scheduled in the province were and still are the Stormont elections in May 2022.  Northern Irish local government vacancies are filled using a co-option system in almost all circumstances; in the last decade this procedure has only once broken down and caused a by-election to happen in the six counties.

Even those Stormont elections could be delayed, if you believe recent remarks from the Northern Ireland secretary; although that's more to do with the fact that there hadn't been a functioning Northern Ireland executive for a large chunk of the current Assembly's term.  Also calling for a delay is Northamptonshire county council, which was an economic disaster area before that became fashionable; the county council want to pause or slow down the current reorganisation in the county.  How this has gone down with Northamptonshire's district councillors, who are now entering the sixth year of a four-year term which has already been extended three times, isn't immediately clear.

<h4>Election Court Watch</h4>

While we wait for better days, there will be some drama from the Election Court which has been awoken from its slumber.  There are two live cases currently before it.  Kamran Malik has launched a petition relating to the East Ham constituency, where he finished sixth and last in the December 2019 general election: Malik polled 0.5% of the vote for his Communities United party.  Stephen Timms, who has represented the area in Parliament since winning the Newham North East by-election in 1994, was returned by East Ham's voters in that poll for an eighth term of office with 76% of the vote, so Malik must have a pretty spectacular case.  On the hand, Malik has a history of failed legal actions (to the extent that the Courts have banned him from suing Newham Council again) and he has previously served not one but two prison sentences for illegally providing immigration advice.  More on this exciting story as we get it.

Elsewhere in the capital we have a case arising out of the Barnhill double by-election which took place in January in the London Borough of Brent.  This was surprisingly close between Labour and the Conservatives: on the winning Labour side Mansoor Akram polled 1,194 votes and Gaynor Lloyd 1,152, while on the Conservative slate Kanta Mistry was runner-up with 1,082 votes ahead of Stefan Volosenuc on 1,018.  Mistry and Volosenuc's petition is basically that the count was wrong and they were the rightful winners.  The Court has ordered a recount which, once things settle down sufficiently for it to take place, should settle the matter fairly quickly.

<h4>Future plans</h4>

This month's column pretty much exhausts the list of interesting stories I had lined up before things fell apart.  I'm keeping myself busy by putting together the Scottish and Welsh local council results from May 2017, and next month's Previews will probably be based on that.  However, if you have a better idea let me know.  I'm all ears.  In the meantime, please remember to take care, live less and stress more.
