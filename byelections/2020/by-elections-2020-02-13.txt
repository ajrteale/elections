There are six by-elections in England on 13th February 2020, and it's a interesting week with lots of unexpected threads linking the polls together.  We have two contests in the Midlands, two in the East and two in the South East, and recurring themes include cabinet ministers from the Major government, a galaxy of stars of film and TV, a well-known national newspaper, and a few juicy scandals past and present.  The Conservatives are defending four of today's by-elections and will have high hopes of gaining the other two, but one of their defences is an unpredictable marginal seat which all three main parties will have genuine hopes of winning.  Let's start with that one:

<h2>Whaley Bridge</h2>

Derbyshire county council; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Alison Fox.

<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/derby-cc-whaley-bri.png" />

We begin this week in the beautiful Peak District, an area of hills and valleys in that ill-defined area where the North West ends and the Midlands begin.  One such valley is that of the River Goyt, which flows north from the Peak to meet the River Tame at Stockport, there forming the Mersey.  The Goyt forms an easy way into the heart of the Peak District, and the railway lines connecting Manchester to Sheffield and Buxton both travel up the Goyt Valley.

Near the head of that valley lies Whaley Bridge, one of the classic small Pennine textile towns in days gone by.  In those days the Goyt was a county boundary, with Cheshire on the west side and Derbyshire on the east side; on the Derbyshire side of the boundary was the village of Fernilee, clearly an extension of but outside the Cheshire urban district of Yeardsley-cum-Whaley.  This was rather cut off from the rest of Cheshire by the high ground to the west.  On reflection this proved not to be a fit local government arrangement, and in 1936 the two sides of this single town were brought together into a single urban district under the jurisdiction of Derbyshire county council.

The town is at the confluence of several valleys, and is also overlooked by a series of reservoirs which fed the Peak Forest Canal and powered the local mills and coalmines.  This has spelt trouble in times of poor weather.  In June 1872 a cloudburst dumped two inches of rain onto the surrounding hills, resulting in severe flooding.  Last August more heavy rain damaged the Toodbrook Reservoir, resulting in damage to the dam; with the town directly below the Toddbrook dam and clearly in danger of inundation, large numbers of people had to be evacuated here and further down the valley for some days until the dam was made safe.  The Environment Agency intends to rebuild the dam over the next few years to prevent a repeat of this.

The county division covers Whaley Bridge together with the ward of Blackbrook, which covers the villages of Buxworth and Chinley on the road towards Chapel-en-le-Frith, together with the offices of High Peak district council.  Since 1974 this has been the local authority for Whaley Bridge, covering an area running from Buxton in the south to Glossopdale in the north.  These are towns which look much more towards Manchester than to distant Derby over the hills, which makes it rather curious that the High Peak district ended up as part of the East Midlands region.

Many of the Pennine areas are fascinatingly marginal, and Whaley Bridge (or Whaley Bridge and Blackbrook, as this seat was known until 2013) is a case in point.  In the 2000s it was a Lib Dem seat, narrowly in 2005 (when the Lib Dems had a 106-vote majority over the Conservatives, safely in 2009.  In 2013 county councillor Barrie Taylor retired and passed his seat on to new Lib Dem David Lomax, but only narrowly so: Lomax polled 32% of the vote, against 28% for the Conservatives and 27% for Labour who had a big increase in their vote. 

<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2017/derbyshire17.png" />

The May 2017 Derbyshire county elections were a big win for the Conservatives, who gained overall control of the county partly thanks to winning all but one of the available seats in High Peak.  That included Whaley Bridge, which was again close: 35% for the winning Conservative candidate Alison Fox, 41 votes ahead of the Lib Dems' Lomax who had 34%, and a third-place finish on 28% for Labour's Ruth George.  Now this is one of the cases where the seat count was deceptive: a lot of the Conservative seats in High Peak were won on tiny majorities like that, and their lead across the district in vote terms was much narrower than the number of county councillors suggested.  In particular, there was a strong third-place vote for the Lib Dems, and it would appear that in the general election five weeks later their voters lined up behind Labour.  35 days after finishing third in Whaley Bridge, Ruth George finished first in the High Peak constituency and defeated the Tory MP Andrew Bingham.

The bad Tory performance continued in the 2019 High Peak council elections, in which the Lib Dems carried both Blackbrook and Whaley Bridge wards.  In Blackbrook they gained a seat from the Tories, while Whaley Bridge elected David Lomax and two Labour councillors who gained their seats from the Conservatives and an independent.  Overall Labour have a small majority on High Peak council, holding 22 out of 43 seats.

Since May 2019, of course, we have had a change of Prime Minister and a new general election, in which Ruth George had the task of defending the High Peak constituency: she lost to the new Tory candidate Robert Largan, but only by 590 votes on a below-average swing of 3% to the Tories.  Largan could presumably rely on the vote of former Tory minister Edwina Currie, the woman who is probably best known now for a series of clandestine Brief Encounters with John Major; she is an elector in Whaley Bridge.  

So this is a difficult defence for the Conservatives which could go any of three ways.  The defending Tory candidate is Fredrick Walton, a former High Peak councillor from the Hope Valley who lost his seat to the Green Party last year.  

The Lib Dems have selected David Lomax, who lost his seat here in 2017 but still sits on High Peak council for Whaley Bridge ward; he was the party's parliamentary candidate for High Peak two months ago.  Labour have reselected former MP Ruth George, who lives in the area.  Completing the ballot paper is Paddy Bann, or Paddy Bannion as he was last year, independent High Peak councillor for Chapel(-en-le-Frith) West ward.

<h2>Yoxall</h2>

East Staffordshire council; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Alan Johnson.

<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/e-staffs-yoxall.png" />

For our other Midlands by-election of the week we travel south from rural Derbyshire to rural Staffordshire.  The village of Yoxall lies a few miles to the west of Burton upon Trent, on the main road from Lichfield to Ashbourne which crosses the River Trent at Yoxall Bridge just to the south.  It's one of the main centres of the former Needwood Forset, parts of which are now being replanted as part of the National Forest project.  The Yoxall ward extends to the north, along the main road, to take in the parishes of Hoar Cross and Newborough.

Staffordshire has swung a mile to the right over the last decade or two, but this area was always safely in Tory hands.  Johnson was first elected at a by-election in November 2011 with 84% of the vote in a straight fight with Labour.  Nobody opposed his re-election in 2015; there was a contest for Yoxall ward in May 2019 at which Johnson's vote increased to 87%.  The local county division (Needwood Forest) isn't much less safe, and Yoxall is also in a safe Tory parliamentary seat (Lichfield).

Despite vote shares like that this by-election is contested.  Defending in the blue corner is Laura Beech, from Marchington on the way to Uttoxeter; challenging from the red corner is Labour candidate and Yoxall resident Michael Baker.

<h2>St Ives East</h2>

Huntingdonshire council, Cambridgeshire; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Jason Ablewhite.

<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/hunts-st-ives-e.png" />

Having met on our travels a curious man married polygamously to seven crazy cat ladies, we arrive at the first of our two by-elections in the east of England.  The Cambridgeshire town of St Ives was an important mediaeval market town, with a good location at the lowest fording-point of the Great Ouse.  The ford was replaced by a bridge in 1107, which was rebuilt in stone in 1414 and is one of only four bridges in England to still have a chapel in the middle.  This bridge was well-used by drovers delivering livestock to Smithfield, and was an important route to London late enough for Cromwell to demolish some of its arches to prevent Royalist troops reaching London in the Civil War.  Despite that, there is a statue of Oliver Cromwell in St Ives town centre today.

The St Ives East ward is rather misnamed in that it covers the northern end of the town's housing.  It has existed since 2004 and was slightly reduced in size at a boundary review in 2018.  St Ives is part of the Huntingdon parliamentary seat, represented back in the day by John Major and just as safe for his Conservative successor Jonathan Djanogly; and in its political makeup St Ives East ward is not significantly different from the parliamentary seat as a whole.

Good news for Jason Ablewhite, who was first elected for this ward in 2004 and quickly rose up the greasy pole.  Ablewhite served for five years as leader of Huntingdonshire council before going on to greater things in May 2016.  Sir Graham Bright (the former Luton South MP) was standing down as Cambridgeshire Police and Crime Commissioner, and Ablewhite got the party's nomination to replace Bright.  He led on the first count with 36%, against 31% for Labour and 17% for UKIP; although Labour got slightly more of the transfers, it wasn't enough to overturn the Conservative lead and the final round was 53-47 in Ablewhite's favour.

On the same day Ablewhite was re-elected for a fourth term on Huntingdonshire council, with 45% against 26% for UKIP and 20% for Labour.  As stated, a boundary review cut that term short and Ablewhite had to seek re-election to the new St Ives East ward in 2018.  On that occasion the Conservative slate had 46% against 29% for the Labour candidate and 25% for the Lib Dem candidate.  Huntingdonshire moved off the thirds electoral cycle from the 2018 election, so have been no local elections here since.

Unfortunately, things have all gone wrong for Jason Ablewhite over the last few months.  He resigned as Cambridgeshire Police and Crime Commissioner on 11 November 2019, and left Huntingdonshire council shortly afterwards, after the Independent Office for Police Conduct opened a misconduct hearing into him.  The allegation is that he had sent explicit photographs to a woman he had met on a tour of the Cambridgeshire Police HQ in Huntingdon.

There has not been a by-election to replace Ablewhite as Cambridgeshire Police and Crime Commissioner because the next scheduled election to the post, in May this year, is imminent.  Ablewhite's deputy, Ray Bisby, is acting as PCC until then.  However, there will be a by-election to Huntingdonshire district council at which Adam Roberts will attempt to defend what should on paper be a safe seat.  With lots of new housing planned for the area, local resident Roberts is campaigning on an unashamedly NIMBY ticket.  The Labour candidate is Barry O'Sullivan, who works for Cambridgeshire county council where he is a UNISON rep; unusually for an O, he is top of the ballot paper.  Colin Saunderson stands for the Lib Dems; he has briefly been a Huntingdonshire district councillor before, having won a by-election to Fenstanton ward in February 2010 before losing his seat in May 2011.  Completing a four-strong ballot paper is Philip Pope, the Mayor of St Ives in 2018-19, who is an independent candidate.

<h2>Borehamwood Kenilworth</h2>

Hertsmere council, Hertfordshire; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Kumail Jaffer.

<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/hertsmere-borehamwood-kenilworth-2020.png" />

We now come to a series of three by-elections in the Home Counties, to fill seats left behind by councillors who were first elected in May 2019 and had been in office for only a matter of months.  Staying in the East of England for the first of this series we come to Hertfordshire, and in the week following the Oscars it's only appropriate that we're in the land of film and TV.  Most of the Los Angeles film studios known generically as Hollywood are actually in neighbouring towns, and similarly the series of film and TV studios generically known as Elstree were and are in fact mostly in what has become the town of Borehamwood.

Much of the acreage of Borehamwood's Kenilworth ward is taken up by the former site of the MGM-British Studios, which from 1948 to 1970 made a series of notable films, and not just for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.  <em>The Inn of the Sixth Happiness</em> was made here by 20th Century Fox, and the site was used for the TV series <em>The Prisoner</em> and <em>UFO</em>.  MGM-British Studios were essentially put out of business in 1970 by Stanley Kubrick, who tied the site up for two whole years with production of <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em>, and the studio site was developed for housing.  Appropriately the main road through the development is called Studio Way while other streets in the ward commemorate giants of the film industry: among others Korda, Novello, Niven and Danziger (the Danziger brothers also had an Elstree Studio) are all remembered in this way.

Kenilworth ward's population has traditionally lived on the south side of Elstree Way, next to the A1 in housing from the great boom immediately after the war which made Borehamwood what it is today.  This is a strongly Jewish area: at the 2011 census, on slightly different boundaries, Kenilworth ward was in the top 40 wards in England and Wales for Judaism.  Social renting in the ward is high, and there is an unusually large black population (6.3%) for a ward in a shire county.

Borehamwood is traditionally the most Labour-inclined part of the strongly Conservative Hertsmere district, which runs along the outer edge of Greater London from Bushey to Potters Bar; but over the last fifteen years or so it has been a key marginal ward.  The Conservatives gained one Labour seat in 2006 by 12 votes, and the other in 2007 by 49 votes; that year the outgoing Labour councillor Frank Ward stood for re-election as an independent candidate and polled 216 votes, so Labour could argue that their vote was split.  Labour regained the Tory seats here in 2011 and 2014, but in 2015 Hertsmere moved away from the thirds electoral system putting both seats up for election, and the Conservatives narrowly gained both seats in Kenilworth ward.  Labour got one seat back at a by-election in October 2017; their candidate on that occasion was Jeremy Newmark, then chairman of the Jewish Labour Movement.  Newmark was subsequently implicated in a controversy over financial irregularities dating from his time as chief executive of the Jewish Leadership Council; however, no charges were brought.  He was successfully re-elected to Hertsmere council in May last year, transferring from here to Borehamwood Cowley Hill ward.

Boundary changes for the 2019 election increased Borehamwood Kenilworth's representation from two councillors to three.  Elected at the top of the poll with 987 votes was Labour's Rebecca Butler, who transferred here from Borehamwood Cowley Hill which she had won in a January 2018 by-election.  Butler was a long way ahead of a race for the final two seats which was extremely close: Cynthia Baker, top of the Conservative slate, finished second on 822 votes, while the remaining two Labour candidates Kumail Jaffer and Dan Ozarow tied for third place on 819 votes each.  Only one of them could be elected: lots were drawn, and the lot fell on Jaffer who was therefore elected on the returning officer's casting vote.  In vote terms the Labour slate led here 55-45.  The ward includes territory from both of Borehamwood's county council divisions, which are Conservative-held.

Newly-elected councillor Jaffer is a young man trying to get into the journalism trade.  He was recently one of two students to be awarded a Stephen Lawrence Scholarship, a scheme to give people from deprived and/or BAME backgrounds a leg-up into national journalism.  Accordingly Councillor Jaffer was recently taken on by the <em>Daily Mail</em> in what will hopefully be a big break for his career.  He hadn't anticipated that the <em>Mail</em> would send him to Glasgow as a Scottish affairs correspondent, a posting which has left him unable to fulfil his democratic duties in Hertfordshire.

So we have a by-election.  Defending this marginal ward for Labour is Dan Ozarow, who lost the drawing of lots to Jaffer nine months ago; Ozarow is the chairman of the party's Hertsmere branch and a lecturer at Middlesex University.  The Conservatives have selected Brett Rosehill, who is fighting his first election campaign and works in the brewery trade.  Two other candidates have come forward to increase choice for the local electors: they are John Humphries for the Green Party (who was their parliamentary candidate for Hertsmere two months ago), and Andy Lewis for the Lib Dems.

<h2>Milford</h2>

Waverley council, Surrey; caused by the death of independent councillor Jack Lee.

<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/waverley-milford.png" />

We travel anticlockwise around London to the North Downs.  Milford is a small town on the main road and railway line from London to Portsmouth, which had some passing trade but really got going as a town with the coming of the railway.  This is another area that's been important for light entertainment over the years.  Milford was home to a TB sanatorium, opened in 1928 by the health minister Neville Chamberlain, whose patients in 1948 included Ray Galton and Alan Simpson.  One of the legendary comedy scriptwriting teams was thus born in Milford Hospital.  Some years later <em>Doctor Who</em> (Pertwee, at the time) fought the Silurians in the hospital, while in real life the former High Sheriff of Surrey Dame Penelope Keith is an elector in Milford.  However, it should be noted that Milford railway station is not the Milford railway station in Noël Coward's play <em>Still Life</em>, which was made into the famous 1945 film <em>Brief Encounter</em>; that station was, of course, Carnforth in Lancashire.

The Waverley district, which covers this south-west corner of Surrey and is based on the town of Farnham, has seen some wild political flings over the years.  The 2003 election returned a Lib Dem majority on the council, the party winning 30 seats to the Tories' 27 despite polling fewer votes.  The Lib Dems crashed and burned in 2007, and were wiped out in the 2011 election when the Conservatives won 56 seats here out of a possible 57.  The single opposition councillor was Diane James, independent councillor for Ewhurst ward, who subsequently joined UKIP: she finished in second place at the 2013 Eastleigh parliamentary by-election, and some years later became leader of the party for about thirty seconds.  James lost her council seat to the Conservatives in 2015; the Tories went slightly backwards that year thanks to the emergence of a localist party in Farnham, but were still in a comfortable position with 53 seats against 3 Farnham Residents and an independent.

Not any more.  The Conservatives performed appallingly across Surrey at the May 2019 local elections, and in Waverley the party lost 30 of the 53 seats they had won four years previously.  Their council group of 23 is still the largest group, but a rainbow coalition of all the other parties is now running the show: 15 Farnham Residents, 14 Lib Dems, two Greens and even two Labour councillors elected in that noted socialist stronghold of Godalming.  One of those Labour councillors is Nick Palmer, who during the last Labour government was the MP for Broxtowe in Nottinghamshire.

Eagle-eyed readers will have noted that those figures add up to 56 rather than the required 57, and the odd one out was independent councillor Jack Lee of Milford ward.  Lee had stood for election here in 2011 and 2015, coming very close to winning a seat on the second occasion in what was a safe Conservative ward.  He was retired after a career in scientific and medical publishing, and was a parish councillor for the Witley parish which this ward is part of.  Jack Lee stood for election to Waverley council for the third time in May 2019, and was elected; the Lib Dems, standing a candidate here for the first time in twelve years, topped the poll on 35%, Lee had 34% and the Tory slate crashed to just 19% of the vote.

The Tories do have big leads at other levels of government: they hold the local county division of Godalming South, Milford and Witley (elected in 2017, before this débâcle), but did go backwards in the December 2019 general election although former foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt was still re-elected safely enough in his South West Surrey constituency.  South West Surrey and its predecessor seat of Farnham have had just three MPs in the last half-century, all of them prominent Tory frontbenchers: Hunt succeeded Virginia Bottomley, who won the 1984 by-election after Maurice Macmillan died.

Baroness Bottomley of Nettlestone and her husband, the Father of the House Sir Peter Bottomley, are electors in this by-election which may be a sterner test for the blue team.  There are two independent candidates vying to succeed Jack Lee; of them, the batter-placed is Maxine Gale, the chairman of Witley parish council, who has been firmly endorsed by the coalition running Waverley council.  The Lib Dems, who topped the poll here last year, have stood down in her favour; also reportedly in Gale's corner is David Munro, the Surrey Police and Crime Commissioner, who has been deselected by the Conservatives.  The other independent candidate is Rosaleen Egan, who finished fifth and last here as the UKIP candidate in May 2019.  The Conservatives have selected Carmel Oates, another Witley parish councillor, who completes an all-female ballot paper.

<h2>Cliffsend and Pegwell</h2>

Thanet council, Kent; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor David Stevens.

For our final by-election of the week we travel to the east Kent coast, a place which has seen all sorts of famous landings over the years.  In AD 597 St Augustine of Canterbury landed on the Isle of Thanet, at a site now marked by a golf course near the village of Cliffsend named in his honour.  Long before that, in the fifth century, Hengist and his wife (or horse?) Horsa turned up in Thanet as, if the legends are to be believed, the leaders of the Anglo-Saxon-Jutish invasion of Britain.  This was commemorated in 1949, fifteen centuries after the event, by the arrival of a Danish ship: the <em>Hugin</em>, a replica Viking longship which was rowed from Denmark from Kent by a crew of 53 men.  The <em>Hugin</em> was subsequently bought by the <em>Daily Mail</em>, at a time when the <em>Daily Mail</em> was prepared to celebrate people coming across from Europe to the Kent coast in boats; the <em>Mail</em> donated the ship to the town of Ramsgate, where it can still be seen today.  Thanet council, together with some EU grant money, paid for a restoration of it fifteen years ago.

<img src="https://www.andrewteele.me.uk/misc/thanet-cliffsend-pegwell.png" />

The <em>Hugin</em> can now be found in the Thanet ward of Cliffsend and Pegwell.  Pegwell is the south-western corner of Ramsgate, giving its name to a bay where the River Stour empties into the North Sea.  The housing lies on top of chalk cliffs, which are pockmarked by tunnels: some of these were used by smugglers back in the day, while there is one large new tunnel which opened in 2000 underneath Pegwell and carries the main road to the port of Ramsgate.

This was a particularly busy tunnel until 2013, when the ferry link to Oostende in Belgium bit the dust.  Later plans by Seaborne Freight to reintroduce ferries on the route in 2019 turned into a well-publicised scandal thanks to political and financial backing from then-transport secretary Chris Grayling.  Once it became clear that Seaborne Freight owned no ships, the ports were not ready to handle its proposed service and there were some concerns about the business model, not to mention the offence taken by Eurotunnel (which launched legal action) and the port of Calais, Grayling was promoted to the sought-after status of international laughing stock.

To be fair, people with far better political skills than Grayling have come a cropper in Thanet politics which has been Byzantine for a very long time.  None of the last three Thanet council elections have produced an administration which lasted a full term.  In the 2011 elections the Conservatives lost their majority on the council; they formed a minority administration with 27 out of 58 seats, which fell a couple of years later after a series of defections and by-election losses.  Labour took over with a minority administration of their own.

The 2015 Thanet council elections coincided with a general election and an injection of populism into the area's politics.  Nigel Farage, then an MEP and leader of UKIP, was contesting the South Thanet constituency based on Ramsgate.  In the end he didn't win, but UKIP did get the consolation prize: a majority on Thanet council mostly at the expense of Labour, who crashed to just four seats.

The usual experience of UKIP council groups has been that they fall apart sooner or later.  The size of the Thanet UKIP group meant the falling-apart took a little longer than usual to complete, but the split eventually came and the Conservatives took back control with a minority administration in 2018.  In the May 2019 election we were back to the status quo ante with a hung Thanet council: 25 Conservatives, 20 Labour councillors, 7 Thanet Independents (some of whom were originally UKIPpers) and three Greens, who won seats in the area for the first time.  The Conservatives initially renewed their minority administration, but this was voted out of office in October 2019 and Labour are now running the council again.

Throughout all this turbulence Cliffsend and Pegwell ward was one of the most politically constant areas of Thanet: normally safe Tory except in 2015 when UKIP won one of the two seats.  The UKIP councillor didn't seek re-election last year and his seat reverted to the Tories with David Stevens joining the council.  Stevens, however, resigned in December after just seven months in office, citing bullying and intimidation in his resignation statement.

The Tory slate in this ward was elected fairly comfortably in 2019, polling 37% against split opposition - 18% for the Greens, 16% for an independent candidate, 15% for Labour.  At Kent county council level the ward is part of the large Ramsgate electoral division, which split its two seats between Labour and the Conservatives in 2017.  The Labour vote, however, tends to come from other parts of Ramsgate.

Defending for the Conservatives is Marc Rattigan; he was the losing candidate on their slate in Ramsgate for the Kent county elections in 2017, and fought St Peter's ward in 2019 - losing to the Green Party by five votes.  The Greens have selected Charlotte Barton, who lives in Cliffsend and works in the NHS.  The independent candidate from 2019, Grahame Birchall, is standing again; he was previously the leader of the Party for a United Thanet and stood for parliament here in 2015.  In his 2019 campaign Birchall was advocating a mayoral referendum for the district.  Labour have selected David Green, a Ramsgate town councillor who sat on Thanet council from 1999 to 2015; he completes the ballot paper.
