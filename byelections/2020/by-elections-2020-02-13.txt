<h2>Whaley Bridge</h2>

Derbyshire county council; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Alison Fox.

We start this week in the Peak District, an area of hills and valleys in that ill-defined area where the North West ends and the Midlands begin.  One such valley is that of the River Goyt, which flows north from the Peak to meet the River Tame at Stockport, there forming the Mersey.  The Goyt forms an easy way into the heart of the Peak District, and the railway lines connecting Manchester to Sheffield and Buxton and both travel up the Goyt Valley.

Near the head of that valley lies Whaley Bridge, one of the classic small Pennine textile towns in days gone by.  In thoe days the Goyt was a county boundary, with Cheshire on the west side and Derbyshire on the east side; on the Derbyshire side of the boundary was the village of Fernilee, clearly an extension of but outside the Cheshire urban district of Yeardsley-cum-Whaley.  This was rather cut off from the rest of Cheshire by the high ground to the west.  On reflection this proved not to be a fit local government arrangement, and in 1936 the two sides of this single town were brought together into a single urban district under the jurisdiction of Derbyshire county council.

The town is at the confluence of several valleys, and is also overlooked by a series of reservoirs which fed the Peak Forest Canal and powered the local mills and coalmines.  This has spelt trouble in times of poor weather.  In June 1872 a cloudburst dumped two inches of rain onto the surrounding hills, resulting in severe flooding.  Last August more heavy rain damaged the Toodbrook Reservoir, resulting in damage to the dam; with the town directly below if the Toddbrook dam failed, large numbers of people had to be evacuated here and further down the valley for some days until the dam was made safe.  The Environment Agency intends to rebuild the dam over the next few years to prevent a repeat of this.

The county division covers Whaley Bridge together with the ward of Blackbrook, which covers the villages of Buxworth and Chinley on the road towards Chapel-en-le-Frith, together with the offices of High Peak distrct council.  Since 1974 this has tbeen the local authority for Whaley Bridge, running from Buxton in the south to Glossopdale in the north.  These are areas which look much more towards Manchester than to distant Derby over the hills, which makes it rather curious that the High Peak district ended up as part of the East Midlands region.

Many of the Pennine areas are fascinatingly marginal, and Whaley Bridge (or Whaley Bridge and Blackbrook, as this seat was known until 2013) is a case in point.  In the 2000s it was a Lib Dem seat, narrowly in 2005 (when the Lib Dems had a 106-vote majority over the Conservatives, safely in 2009.  In 2013 county councillor Barrie Taylor retired and passed his seat on to new Lib Dem David Lomax, but only narrowly so: Lomax polled 32% of the vote, aginst 28% for the Conservatives and 27% for Labour who had a big increase in their vote. 

The May 2017 Derbyshire county elections were a big win for the Conservatives, who gained overall control of the county partly thanks to winning all but one of the county seats in High Peak.  That included Whaley Bridge, which was again close: 35% for the winning Conservative candidate Alison Fox, 41 votes ahead of the Lib Dems' Lomax who had 34%, and a third-place finish on 28% for Labour's Ruth George.  Now this is one of the cases where the seat count was deceptive: a lot of the Conservative seats in High Peak were won on tiny majorities like that, and their lead across the district in vote terms was much narrower than the number of county councillors implied.  In particular, there was a strong third-place vote for the Lib Dems, and it would appear that in the general election five weeks later their votes lined up behind Labour.  35 days after finishing third in Whaley Bridge, Ruth George finished first in the High Peak constituency and defeated the Tory MP Robert Largan.

The bad Tory performance continued in the 2019 High Peak council elections, in which the Lib Dems carried both Blackbrook and Whaley Bridge wards.  In Blackbrook they gained a seat from the Tories, while Whaley Bridge elected David Lomax and two Labour councillors who gained their seats from the Conservatives and an independent.  Overall Labour have a small majority on High Peak council, holding 22 out of 43 seats.
