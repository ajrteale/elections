Two local by-elections on 19th November 2020:

<h2>Perth City North; and<br/>Perth City South</h2>

Perth and Kinross council; caused respectively by the resignation of Dave Doogan, who is now the MP for Angus, and by the death of Bob Band.  Both were Scottish National Party councillors.


Welcome to the Fair City of Perth, the gateway to the Highlands and the northern end of the UK's motorway network.  Perth has been a major city since the 12th century when King William the Lion gave it the status of a Royal Burgh; the city benefited from its location at the head of the Tay estuary and its closeness to Scone Abbey, one of the centres of the Scottish monarchy, to become a major port trading with continental Europe.  Industry came in the eighteenth century, and in the Victorian era Perth developed into a major railway junction where main lines to Dundee, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Inverness all met.  Today there is a diverse economy with a significant financial services presence: the largest employers are the local council and the bus company Stagecoach, which is based here, and the city (formally re-created as such for the Diamond Jubilee in 2012) is a major service centre for the local area.

For electoral purposes the city is divided into three wards: the City Centre ward east of the railway lines, and the City North and City South wards to the west.  These wards were originally drawn up for the 2007 elections to Perth and Kinross council and returned four councillors each; slight boundary changes for the 2017 election saw the North ward go down from four seats to three.

The North and South wards are rather different in character.  South ward, running along the Glasgow Road to the Broxburn roundabout, is based on Burghmuir which is Perth's most desirable residential area.  North ward is based on the Hillyland and Tulloch areas along the Crieff Road, which is much more downmarket; although there are some jobs here at the Inveralmond industrial estate.  Since 2017 the deprived Letham area has been divided between the two wards.

This social divide is reflected in the wards' election results.  In both the 2007 and 2012 elections North ward returned two SNP councillors and two Labour councillors.  The boundary changes for the 2017 election shook things up a bit by removing some of the some best Labour areas in Letham, and this combined with the crash in the Scottish Labour vote after the 2014 indyref to result in major changes.  In May 2017 the Scottish National Party topped the poll again with 49% of the vote, and won 2 out of 3 seats; the Conservatives finished second on 26% and picked up a seat here for the first time; Labour crashed to just 16% and were shut out.  The SNP's Dave Doogan topped the poll with 35% of the first preferences, to win a second term as councillor.

Perth City South, on the other hand, is dominated politically by long-serving Liberal Democrat councillor Willie Wilson.  Wilson has topped the poll here in all three ordinary elections, and he got a running-mate in at the 2007 election where the other two seats split between the Tories and SNP.  Labour gained up one of the Liberal Democrat seats in 2012.

In May 2017 Willie Wilson, like Dave Doogan in the neighbouring ward, topped the poll in Perth City South with 35% of the first preferences.  Had the Lib Dems stood a second candidate, 35% would have given them a good chance of winning 2 seats out of 4.  The SNP polled 26%, the Conservatives 25% and Labour just 6%.  Although Labour did pick up most of the unionist transfers, that was too far behind to come back from, and the SNP gained the Labour seat by 42 votes in the final count.

The Conservatives had changed candidate for the 2017 election, after their long-serving Perth City South councillor Alexander Stewart was elected to the Scottish Parliament in 2016 (he represents the Mid Scotland and Fife region).  In retrospect the Tories made a poor choice of candidate to replace Stewart in the council chamber.  New councillor Michael Jamieson was forced to resign within months of his election, after police raided his home on suspicion of possession of indecent images.  He subsequently pleaded guilty to that crime before Perth Sheriff Court, being spared prison in the final reckoning.

The resulting Perth City South by-election in November 2017 (which you can read about in <em>Andrew's Previews 2017</em>, page 347) was very close.  On first preferences the SNP led with 32%, the Conservatives were second on 31% and the Liberal Democrats were third on 29%.  Transfers from Labour and the Greens enabled the Lib Dems to narrow the gap, but they were eliminated 29 votes behind the Conservatives and 150 votes behind the SNP.  The Liberal Democrat transfers then broke in favour of new Tory candidate Audrey Coates, who overtook the SNP in the final count to hold the by-election by 52% to 48%, a majority of 154 votes.

So, South ward is very much game on with the November 2017 by-election suggesting that three parties have a genuine chance of winning.  This South ward by-election follows the death in March of SNP councillor Bob Band, who had served the ward since 2007; he was 72 years old and had been suffering from cancer.  The council intend to keep councillor Band's name alive in the ward by naming part of the new Perth High School building after him.

The 2017 elections to Perth and Kinross council returned 17 Conservatives, 15 Scottish Nationalists, 4 Lib Dems, 3 independents and a Labour councillor (for the unlikely-looking Labour area of Carse of Gowrie).  The Tories run the council as a minority, and that is unlikely to change as a result of these by-elections.  Both North and South wards are part of the Perth and North Perthshire parliamentary constituency, which was a photofinish in June 2017 when the SNP's Pete Wishart was re-elected just 21 votes ahead of the Conservatives; Wishart won a further term much more comfortably in December 2019.

Defending Band's seat for the SNP is Iain Macpherson, who has worked in counselling and social work.  The Conservatives, who won the November 2017 by-election, have selected local businessman Andy Chan.  The Liberal Democrats, who topped the poll here in May 2017, have reselected Liz Barrett who was their candidate in the November 2017 by-election.  Also standing for Perth City South are Tricia Duncan for Labour, former SNP councillor Elspeth MacLachlan for the Greens and Lynda Davis for UKIP.  Usual reminders apply: Votes at 16 and all that jazz, and - after it made all the difference last time - the Alternative Vote will be in use.

The SNP should have an easier time defending Perth City North, where their defending candidate is businessman Ian Massie.  The Conservatives have selected Aziz Rehman, won runs two takeaway businesses.  The Labour candidate is Nicola Ferry, a trade union youth officer who works in the postal service.  Also standing are James Graham for the Lib Dems and Paul Vallot for the Green Party

<h2>Review of the Year</h2>

<blockquote>
The same procedure as last year, Miss Sophie?
</blockquote>

The Germans and Scandivians know how to celebrate the New Year.  As well as all the drunkenness and festivity you might expect, the television broadcasts a very old comedy sketch called <em>Der 90. Geburtstag</em> or, as the original English title has it, <em>Dinner for One</em>.  Half of all Germans tune in to watch this piece of drunken nostalgia, in the original English, every New Year's Eve.

As time goes on a number of people, not least James the butler, have asked whether this sketch has outstayed its welcome?  The answer from the public and Miss Sophie is always no.  As time goes on a number of people, not least James the butler, have asked whether it is appropriate to keep doing the same thing over and over again?  The answer from the public and Miss Sophie is always yes, and deal with the consequences yourself.

This is the last Andrew's Previews of the year, and the tradition of this column is to mark the occasion by summing up the old year, looking forward to the new and expressing the wish that the new year be better than the old.  For some years now, I have wrestled with the question as to whether that wish is an appropriate one - can we reasonably expect the new year to be an improvement on the last?
