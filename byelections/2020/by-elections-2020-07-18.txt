"All the right votes, but not necessarily in the right order"

Well, you have to start somewhere.  Welcome to Andrew's Previews' countdown to the May 2021 elections, which promise (in that hazy, faraway fantasy called the future) to be one of the biggest electoral events of this Parliament.  The whole of Great Britain is due to go to the polls.  And there's not just one type of election involved: many voters will have two, three or (in some cases) four ballot papers to juggle, and multiple electoral systems abound.  It's complicated.

For this reason there will be a long series (quite a long series) of Preview pieces.  I'm going to start by setting out the scene in the north-east of England.  Here we have up for election the police and crime commissioners for Northumbria, Durham and Cleveland; the Mayors of the Tees Valley and North Tyneside; and elections for a third of the five Tyne and Wear boroughs and the whole of Northumberland, Durham and Hartlepool councils.

<h2>Police and Crime Commissioners, and the Tees Valley mayoralty</h2>

We start with the Police and Crime Commissioner elections, which like so many other things have been held over from 2020.  The biggest of these elections in the North East is for Northumbria Police, whose remit covers the counties of Tyne and Wear, and Northumberland and has an electorate of over a million people.  The Northumbria PCC from 2002 to 2016 was Dame Vera Baird, the former Labour MP for Redcar; she resigned in 2019 to take up a new post as Victims' Commissioner for England and Wales.  The resulting by-election, held in July 2019, saw Labour's Kim McGuinness, a Newcastle upon Tyne city councillor, take the lead on first preferences: 38%, against 22% each for two Northumberland councillors, independent candidate Georgina Hill and Conservative Robbie Moore; the Lib Dems coming in fourth and last with 19%.  However, Hill picked up most of the transfers, meaning that McGuinness was elected in the run-off by the narrow margin of 52-48.

The December 2019 general election saw particularly good performances for the Conservatives in County Durham, where they gained four seats and polled the most votes across the Durham Constabulary area.  The post of Durham PCC had been held since its inception in 2012 by Ron Hogg, who had led the English police response against football hooliganism during the 2002 FIFA World Cup in Japan and South Korea.  Hogg died in December 2019 and his deputy, Steven White, is serving as PCC in an acting capacity until an election can be held.  Hogg had been re-elected in the first round in 2016, defeating the Conservatives 64-24; the Tories will be hoping for a big swing next time round.

The short-lived county of Cleveland was based on the Teesside conurbation but named after the rural area to the east of it, a land of cliffs and countryside between Saltburn and Whitby.  The county died a death in the 1990s, but Cleveland Police still exist to cover the four boroughs of Redcar and Cleveland, Middlesbrough, Stockton and Hartlepool.  Since 2012 the Cleveland police and crime commissioner has been another Labour man, former Middlesbrough councillor Barry Coppinger.  He was re-elected in 2016 with a 62-38 lead over the Conservatives in the runoff.  Coppinger is not standing again.

The Tees Valley mayoral election the following year told a completely different story.  The electorate here consists of the four Cleveland boroughs plus Darlington, and the addition of Darlington made all the difference.  Ben Houchen, who had previously been leader of the Conservative group on Stockton-on-Tees council, was elected as the first Mayor of the Tees Valley by the narrow margin of 51.1% to 48.9% for Labour in the runoff, having led 39.5-39.0 on first preferences.  With the Conservatives having gained three seats here in December 2019 (plus the Sedgefield constituency, part of which is in Darlington borough), and local elections across the area having been dire for Labour, Houchen must be fairly confident about the prospect of re-election.

<h2>Local councils</h2>

I'll now turn to the eight councils up for election in this region in 2021, taking them in descending order of population.  The largest of these districts on that metric is Durham council, which is the fourth-largest elected body in the UK (after the House of Commons, the new Buckinghamshire council and the Scottish Parliament), with a total membership of 126.  This is due to the fact that Durham is one of the larger unitary councils, the district councils under it having been abolished in 2009.

The last elections to Durham council were in 2017 and left Labour with a reduced majority.  They won 74 seats against 25 for various categories of independents and localists, 14 for the Liberal Democrats (who are particularly strong in Durham city), 10 Conservatives and 3 seats for the North East Party, a regionalist movement with a powerbase in the New Town of Peterlee.  None of the ten Conservative councillors were elected in the North West Durham constituency, which the party now holds in Westminster.  There have been six by-elections since 2017, with Labour holding three, the Lib Dems holding one and (in May 2019) gaining Shildon and Dene Valley from Labour, and a by-election in Spennymoor in May 2019 which saw an independent candidate finish in first place with just 19% of the vote, succeeding a different independent.

Northumberland was a different story in May 2017, with the Conservatives almost winning an overall majority.  Their 12 net gains, for a total of 33 seats, were mostly due to a collapse by the Lib Des who lost all their seats in the Berwick upon Tweed constituency.  However, the Conservatives did also gain two seats in Cramlington (one of them was gained from Laura Pidcock, who subsequently had an ill-starred Parliamentary career in North West Durham) and tied for first place in the South Blyth division whose Lib Dem councillor was re-elected on the drawing of lots.  This was a sign of things to come: Cramlington and Blyth are both in the Blyth Valley constituency which was the first Conservative gain of the December 2019 general election.  With 33 seats against 24 for Labour, 7 independents and 3 Lib Dems the Conservatives formed a minority administration, although they're a man down at the moment after Robbie Moore (their candidate in the Northumbria PCC by-election) was elected in December as MP for Keighley.  His seat in Alnwick is vacant.

The largest of the five Tyne and Wear boroughs is another early declarer: the city of Sunderland.  This column wrote in 2019 that Sunderland has a Labour administration which is very locally unpopular while also having a very secure majority, and despite losing 12 councillors in 2019 that's still true.  The Labour group currently has 51 seats (one of which is vacant), against 12 Conservatives, 8 Lib Dems, 3 UKIPpers and 1 Green.  There are 10 wards with split representation and Labour are defending every single of them; but for the party's majority to be in serious danger they'd have to do far worse than in 2019.

Things are much more secure for Labour in the other four Tyne and Wear boroughs.  In Newcastle upon Tyne the party has 54 seats (four of which are vacant) against 20 Lib Dems and four independents and localists.  A repeat of the 2019 results would see Labour lose three seats: North Jesmond and Ouseburn to the Lib Dems, and Callington and Throckley ward to the localists.

North Tyneside is different to the other four Tyne and Wear boroughs in that it has an elected mayor.  The mayoralty has been held by both Labour and the Conservatives in the past, but the last mayoral election in 2017 had a big lead for Labour's Norma Redfearn who was re-elected in the first round with a 56-31 lead over the Conservatives.  Labour hold 51 of the 60 seats on the council (one of which is vacant) against 7 Conservatives, a Lib Dem and an independent; a repeat of the 2019 results would see the Conservatives gain Cullercoats and Tynemouth wards from Labour, but Labour would gain Monkseaton North from the Conservatives and also pick up the Lib Dem seat in Northumberland ward.

Gateshead is a borough where very little seems to change from election to election.  There are currently 52 Labour seats (one of which is vacant) against 12 Lib Dems and two independent councillors who were elected on the Lib Dem ticket.  One of the defectors (in Whickham South and Sunniside) is up for re-election next year.  A repeat of the 2019 results would result in no change to the Labour total.

<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/styneside19.png" />

South Tyneside, on the other hand, had some excitement in the 2019 elections where Labour lost five seats, four to independents and the other (Beacon and Bents ward, covering South Shields town centre) to the Green Party.  In 2016 Labour won a clean sweep of all 18 wards, some of which may prove tricky to defend; although with 47 seats out of a possible 54 it is impossible for the party to lose its majority here.

<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/hartlepool19.png" />

Lest but definitely not least is Hartlepool, where local politics has been bizarre for many years and seems to have got more so since the Monkey Mayor left the scene.  All simian and indeed human life is here, and the council membership is the broadest of broad churches with members from the Socialist Labour Party at one end of the political spectrum, the For Britain Movement at the other end and representatives of nearly every viewpoint in between.  The Scargillite group is in fact the former Labour council leadership following a split in early 2019; that split and six seat losses for Labour in May 2019 means that the town is now in the hands of a group which was originally called the Independent Union, before affiliating to the Brexit Party, before leaving the Brexit Party and becoming the Independent Union again.  They are running the show in alliance with those obvious political bedfellows the Scargillites and the Conservatives.  The usual medicine for political basket cases like Hartlepool is to hit the reset button with an all-out election, and as luck would have it the Local Government Boundary Commission were in town recently so there will be an all-out election next time on new ward boundaries.

<h2>July 2020 update</h2>

To finish, a quick update on the state of play as regards future elections.  Your columnist has a list with (at the time of writing) one hundred and seventy-one councillor vacancies on it, around ten of which are reportedly a direct result of Covid-19 infection.  Don't forget to stay alert, etc.

Assuming things continue to get better on that front, the next election due is on 1 October 2020, for which date by-elections have been pencilled in by the returning officers for Aberdeenshire, Orkney Islands and West Lothian councils.  Voters in England and Wales will have to wait until the new year to fill their vacancies: as things currently stand by-elections in Wales are to be delayed until 1 February 2021 at the earliest, and there is no action scheduled in England until the ordinary May 2021 elections.

This ever-growing number of vacancies has had some consequences in our town halls, most prominently in Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole where the death of an independent councillor wiped out the majority of the rainbow coalition running that council.  The Conservatives promptly put together a confidence motion in an attempt to seize control for themselves, but that was defeated by the council chairman's casting vote.

Things have taken a rather different path in Crawley, where Labour had a 19-17 majority over the Conservatives after the 2019 elections but are now the second-largest group after one Labour councillor died and two others went independent.  Following a review of the situation, the Crawley Conservatives have decided to prop Labour up with what is described as a confidence and supply arrangement.

Finally, there is some progress to report in the case of <em>Voloseniuc v Akram</em>, which relates to the Barnhill double by-election last January in the London Borough of Brent.  The Conservative slate of Stefan Voloseniuc and Kanta Mistry allege that the count went wrong and they are the rightful winners.  Following a delay for obvious reasons, the recount took place on 16 and 17 July and a report on that is being prepared for the forthcoming trial in the Election Court.  I will of course keep you updated on this, and on other electoral matters as they develop.
