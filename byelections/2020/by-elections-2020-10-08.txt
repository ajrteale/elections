"All the right votes, but not necessarily in the right order"

At the time of writing, there is one local by-election on 8th October 2020:

<h2>Na Hearadh agus Ceann a Deas nan Loch</h2>

Comhairle nan Eilean Siar; caused by the resignation of independent councillor Finlay Cunningham who had served since 2017.

After last week's successful local by-election it's time for another one.  We are still a long way from the British mainland, but this time the focus shifts from the Orkneys to the west.

Rather far west, it has to be said.  We're on a large island here, the third largest of the British Isles by area (after Great Britain and Ireland).  As the name might suggest, Lewis with Harris has a bit of a split personality.  Lewis is relatively flat; Harris, covering roughly the southern third of the island, is generally mountainous.  Lewis includes the main town of the Outer Hebrides, Stornoway; Harris is sparsely populated.  The division goes back centuries to when Lewis and Harris were the lands of rival branches of the Clan MacLeod; Lewis ended up in the hands of the Earls of Seaforth and in the county of Ross-shire, while Harris stayed with the MacLeods and became part of the county of Inverness-shire.

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/ba/Lewis-Harris_%22border%22_-_geograph.org.uk_-_452715.jpg" />

One of the less-visited parts of Lewis is Park, a peninsula cut off from Harris by Loch Seaforth and from most of Lewis by Loch Erisort.  Park is a hilly area which is very sparsely populated.  The main local industry is crofting, and Park was bought by the local residents in 2015 under crofting "right to buy" rules passed by the Scottish Parliament in 2003.

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/Taransay_Beach.jpg" />

All the villages and communities in the south of Park were cleared in the nineteenth century, and evacuation of remote areas is a theme running through the history of this ward.  Consider the island of Taransay, where people have lived since around AD 300 and which supported three villages into the nineteenth century, but has been uninhabited since 1974.  With one prominent but temporary exception: <em>Castaway 2000</em>, a BBC television series which marooned 36 men, women and children on the island for a year to build a community from scratch.  The show made a star of Ben Fogle, one of the castaways, who later made an unsuccessful attempt to buy Taransay when it was placed on the market in 2011.

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/94/Machias_Seal_Island_puffins.jpg" />

Further out from Taransay, but still traditionally part of Harris, is the oldest of Scotland's six UNESCO World Heritage Sites, and the only World Heritage Site in the UK recognised for both its cultural and natural heritage.  This is the remote archipelago of St Kilda, which supports several unusual species of sheep and rodents and a large number of seabirds, but has no human residents following an evacuation in 1930.

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/Cleit_above_Village_Bay.jpg" />

In many ways the story of St Kilda is a sad one.  Visiting ships brought diseases to the island including cholera, smallpox and childhood tetanus, the last leading to an appalling infant mortality rate in the late nineteenth century; at the same time the advent of tourism and the establishment of a Royal Navy signal station during the Great War disturbed the local way of life.  After the war most of the islands' young men emigrated; that, followed by a series of crop failures, convinced the 36 remaining islanders to leave.  There are still people living on St Kilda, working for the National Trust for Scotland (which owns the archipelago), working for the Ministry of Defence (which uses the surrounding seas as a missile testing range), or studying the local flora, fauna and archaeology; but none of those people are permanent residents.

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedihumana/commons/c/c5/Rockall_Union_flag_hoisted_1955.jpg" />

Mind, St Kilda is a metropolis compared to the most remote of all the British Isles.  Rockall, a granite islet 230 miles from the Outer Hebrides, was claimed for the United Kingdom in 1955 by R H Connell, the captain of HMS <em>Vidal</em>, mainly in order to stop people going there to spy on those missile tests.  Subsequently, Rockall became a point of international controversy over whether this gave the UK rights to an exclusive economic zone around the island; this was a particular bone of contention for the Irish government, which doesn't recognise the UK's claim on Rockall.  The British, Irish, Danish and Icelandic governments have subsequently come to an agreement on their exclusive economic zones in the North Atlantic, with Rockall placed within the British EEZ; however, the boundaries between British and Irish waters were drawn without taking account of Rockall's position.

If anybody wants to put the Western Isles' electoral services team to the test by registering to vote on Rockall, it's your own time you're wasting.  Nobody has ever lasted on that rock long enough to establish residence within the meaning of electoral law.  But if somebody managed to pass the residence test there, there's a question-mark as to which ward they would end up in.  Under the terms of the Island of Rockall Act 1972, Rockall was incorporated into Scotland as part of the District of Harris in the County of Inverness.  The 1972 Act was amended the following year to substitute a reference to the Western Isles, following a reorganisation of local government in Scotland.  Despite this, Rockall (and indeed St Kilda) were not included on the maps I can find defining the ward boundaries for the Comhairle nan Eilean Siar from the 2007 election.  Prior to 2007 St Kilda was part of Harris West ward, which included "St Kilda, Boreray, Pabbay, Shillay, Coppay, Taransay, Glas Sgeir, Cairearn and all other islands along [the ward's] eastern and western coastal extent", so I'll place Rockall in the modern-day ward based on Harris.  The Ordnance Survey appear to think St Kilda is now covered by a ward based on North Uist rather than Harris, but I haven't been able to find confirmation of that.

As can be seen from all that sea, fishing has been very important to the economy of Harris.  Which brings us to a slightly mad scheme from a slightly mad but very successful businessman turned politician.  No, not Donald Trump (although stay tuned for next week's Preview, if we get that far...); I'm referring here to William Hesketh Lever, who was born in 1851 in Bolton.  Lever went into the family's wholesale grocery business, but made his name and fortune as the brains and driving force behind the soap manufacturing company Lever Brothers (one of the forerunners of the modern multinational Unilever).  Having put Sunlight into all our homes, he was elected as Liberal MP for the Wirral in the 1906 landslide, serving one term in the Commons.  In these days of cancellation of historic public figures, we should remember that Lever Brothers had signed a treaty with the Belgian government in 1911 to gain access to palm oil from the Belgian Congo, where working practices were, well, not that great; but focusing on that would miss the point that Lever's style towards his employees was paternalistic to a fault.

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2b/Leverburgh_housing_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1035376.jpg" />

In 1918 Lord Leverhulme (as he had become by that point) bought the Isle of Lewis for £167,000; the following year he bought South Harris for £36,000.  He had a plan for developing a modern fishing industry on Lewis with Harris, with distribution across the UK through a network of fishmongers under the brand name of Mac Fisheries.  Leverhulme's plans to recruit crofters for the scheme ran into trouble in Lewis and were quickly abandoned there, but the scheme for South Harris developed to the extent that the fishing village of An t-Òb was renamed in his honour, becoming Leverburgh.  Following Leverhulme's death in 1925, the Lever Brothers board put a stop to this nonsense, and that was the end of the developments on Harris.  Mac Fisheries made it into the 1970s, but has long disappeared from the nation's high streets.

So all this activity left Harris relatively little changed in the end.  Today crofting and Harris tweed are important to the local economy, and award-winning gin comes out of the Harris Distillery in Tarbert.  From Tarbert there is a ferry connection to Uig on Skye; while another ferry (even on Sundays, sacrilege!) connects Leverburgh to Berneray for North Uist and points south.  A majority of the population speak Gaelic, which is reflected in the name of the electoral ward (a rough English translation would be "Harris and South Lochs").

The Comhairle nan Eilean Siar is the largest of the three Scottish islands councils created in 1975 and left untouched by the 1990s reorganisation.  It's always had an independent majority, but from the 1990s onwards there has been a minority of councillors elected on party political platforms.  We see this at the 2003 election, when the two Harris wards elected independent councillors and Lochs ward narrowly voted SNP.

Proportional representation came in for the 2007 election but didn't change that party balance.  Morag Munro, outgoing councillor for Harris West ward, was elected at the top of the poll with 49% of the first preferences; her transfers elected a second independent, Catherine Macdonald, and Philip McLean won the final seat for the Scottish National Party fairly comfortably.  Munro retired at the 2012 election, in which Macdonald sought re-election as the only independent candidate and was re-elected with a whopping 62% of the first preference votes, far ahead of the 25% required to win a seat.  Philip McLean was also re-elected for the SNP on the first count.  With a choice between Labour candidate DJ Macrae and a second SNP candidate, Macdonald's surplus went strongly to Macrae who won the final seat despite polling just 69 first-preference votes, 9% of the total.  69 first preferences is the lowest winning total for any Scottish local councillor in a contested election this century, although Macrae did pick up another 96 votes from Macdonald's transfers to make his final score rather more respectable.

Na Hearadh agus Ceann a Deas nan Loch had a clearout of its representatives at the May 2017 local elections.  With a much longer ballot paper of nine candidates (seven independents and two Scottish Nationalists), new candidate Finlay Cunnningham topped the poll with 33% of the vote and was elected on the first count.  DJ Macrae polled just 42 first preferences in his re-election attempt and was eliminated in eighth place.  A close race developed for the final two seats between independent candidate Paul Finnegan who started on 16.5%, new SNP candidate John Mitchell (15%) and outgoing councillor Catherine Macdonald (14.5%) who were a long way ahead of the rest.  Mitchell started the count 6 votes ahead of Macdonald, and once everybody else had been eliminated he won the final seat 18 votes ahead of Macdonald.

Over all nine wards in the Comhairle nan Eilean Siar 2017 election, independent candidates won 23 seats, the SNP 7 and the Conservatives picked up one - their first ever seat on this council.  In a blow for equality, the loss of Catherine Macdonald's seat meant that all 31 councillors were male.

Will that change in this by-election?  We shall see.  Three candidates have come forward, all of whom are independents.  Taking them in ballot paper order, first alphabetically is Grant Fulton who is the only Harris resident on the ballot; based in Leverburgh, he is a development officer for Harris Development Ltd and is concerned by the effect of current circumstances on the ward's tourist industry.  Annie Macdonald, who works in the care sector, lives outside the ward in Laxay but has represented part of it in the past: she was the SNP councillor for the former Lochs ward from 2003 to 2007, then represented the neighbouring ward of Sgir'Uige agus Ceann a Tuath nan Loch from 2007 to 2012 in the nationalist interest.  This time she is an independent candidate.  Kris O'Donnell also lives outside the ward, in Arivruaich; he is concerned about the future of crofting and, like the other two candidates, opposes the proposed closure of the Park primary school.

Going forward, this ward is likely to be broken up for the next Scottish local elections in 2022.  The current proposals are for Harris to become a ward of its own, going down from three councillors to two, with Park and the rest of the Lochs area united in another two-seat ward.  It appears that St Kilda will definitely be included in a ward based on North Uist going forward (as stated above, it might be there already).  No word on Rockall.

We do need to mention the elephant in the room.  The North Isles by-election in Orkney last week was effectively an all-postal affair; this by-election, by contrast, will be the first opportunity to see how polling stations can work in a time of pandemic.  There are four polling stations for this by-election, and various additional hygiene measures area in place; in particular, no more than one elector or family group will be allowed into the polling station at any one time.  If you are going to cast your vote, have confidence that you will be doing so safely.

One by-election on 15th October 2020:

<h2>Ellon and District</h2>

Aberdeenshire council; caused by the resignation of Scottish National Party councillor Richard Thomson, who is now the Member of Parliament for Gordon.  He had served since 2012.

Have you missed party politics?  Well, frankly it would be a welcome distraction from the disaster we have to put up with at the moment.  If you have missed party political elections then this is your lucky day.  The waiting is over.  30 weeks after our last party political election in Coventry, local by-elections are back.  Welcome to Aberdeenshire.

For this week's single poll we have come to Ellon, a town of around 10,000 souls located sixteen miles north of Aberdeen on the River Ythan.  In case you're fed up of islands after last two week's Previews, there is no relief here because Ellon is named after an island in the Ythan; the name comes from <em>Eilean</em>, the Gaelic word for "island".  The island formed a place where the Ythan could be forded at the head of its estuary, and a town sprang up.  This is the main town in the agricultural Formartine area, but Ellon itself has become a dormitory town for Aberdeen and many of its jobs are underpinned by the North Sea oil industry.  The ward associated with Ellon takes in a large number of villages, of which the largest is the port of Newburgh further down the estuary.

The list of famous people associated with Ellon is an eclectic one.  In sport we have Paul Sturrock, an Ellon-born striker who was capped 20 times for Scotland; he spent the whole of a stellar playing career with Dundee United before going into football club management in Scotland and England, with some success.  In music we have the percussionist Dame Evelyn Glennie, who attended the local secondary school (now called Ellon Academy).  In business we have the noted publicity-seekers Brewdog, a brewery and pub chain which has been based in Ellon since 2012.  Their Punk IPA is one of the UK's bestselling craft beers, while the company has also hit the front pages with a number of claims on the "strongest beer ever made" record.  Brewdog have noisily done their bit for the current emergency by reworking their production lines to make hand sanitiser for the local hospitals.

Perhaps some of that hand sanitiser might be useful for a recovering COVID patient associated with Ellon and District, who makes Brewdog look like amateurs when it comes to attracting publicity.  An American TV personality and businessman called Donald Trump bought a plot of sand dunes partially within the ward boundary in 2006, with the intention of building the world's best golf course.  The Trump International Golf Links development was thrown out by Aberdeenshire council's planning committee, but subsequently granted permission following a Scottish government inquiry at which Trump himself testified.  The golf course opened in 2012 notwithstanding a tantrum thrown by the Donald over an offshore windfarm development near the site; the resulting legal action ended up in the UK Supreme Court, which after due consideration rejected Trump's case in 2015.

Donald Trump was, as we all know, elected as President of the United States a year after that court case.  The USA is of course, full of political types who attract controversy: for instance, one of Trump's Republican running-mates for Congress in 2016 is described as a <a href="https://cookpolitical.com/analysis/house/oregon-house/rating-change-defazios-or-04-moves-likely-lean-democrat">"wacky alt-scientist who believes urine holds the secret to human life extension"</a>.  Here in what is for now the United Kingdom, we have a different style when it comes to politicians that attract controversies.

Since 1983 Ellon has been part of the Gordon parliamentary constituency, which is still named after a local government district which was abolished in 1996.  This was a Liberal Democrat seat until 2015, when it was gained by Alex Salmond who rode the SNP wave into Parliament as the Nationalists won 56 Scottish seats out of a possible 59.  Salmond can take a lot of credit for that, having served as First Minister from 2007 until 2014 and led the SNP on and off since 1990.  He had represented Gordon (and its successor seat, Aberdeenshire East) in the Scottish Parliament since 2007; in May 2015 Salmond won the Gordon parliamentary seat on a 14-point swing from the Lib Dems, and became the SNP's foreign affairs spokesman in Westminster.

Back in May 2007, on the same day that Alex Salmond became an MSP there was an election to Aberdeenshire council, the first under the proportional representation system.  In 2003 the SNP had carried the single-member Ellon Town ward but the three wards covering the rural areas around Ellon had all voted Lib Dem, and that was reflected in the candidate list for the new ward of Ellon and District.  The Lib Dems had two candidates for the four available seats, with the other major parties nominating one candidate each.  This decision backfired badly on the SNP, as their candidate Rob Merson topped the poll with 41% against 32% for the two Lib Dem candidates.  A second Nationalist candidate would have stood a very good chance of election; instead the Lib Dems won two seats with the SNP and Conservatives getting one each.

No such mistake was made in 2012, as the SNP polled 50% of the first preferences and easily gained a second seat from the Lib Dems, who didn't try and defend it.  The second SNP councillor was Richard Thomson, who two years previously had come second to the long-serving Lib Dem MP Sir Malcolm Bruce in the 2010 Westminster general election for Gordon.  Richard did finish well ahead of his near-namesake Ross Thomson, a young Conservative who subsequently had a controversial time in the Scottish Parliament and later the House of Commons from 2016 to 2019.

The May 2017 election to Aberdeenshire council was the first hint of what was to come in the general election five weeks later.  It's one of those occasions where a picture paints a thousand words:

<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2017/aberdeenshire17.png" />

Across the district, the Conservatives polled 40% of the first preferences against 28% for the SNP and 14% for the Liberal Democrats.  It's fair to say that the Aberdeenshire Conservatives either didn't see this result coming or didn't believe it was coming.  With favourable transfers, they would have had a chance of an overall majority on the 70-seat council - but the party had only nominated 23 candidates among the 21 wards, and all 23 of them were elected with lots of room to spare.  The SNP did not benefit from this undernomination because of the transferable-vote system: the Conservative vote here was strongly Unionist, and in nearly every ward their spare transfers went on to pull Liberal Democrat or independent candidates over the line ahead of the Nationalist slate.

Ellon and District was about the only exception to this pattern.  Long-serving Conservative councillor Gillian Owen topped the poll with 41% of the vote and was elected on the first count, the SNP candidates Richard Thomson and Anouk Kahanov-Kloppert had 32% between them, and outgoing Lib Dem councillor Isobel Davidson started just a few votes short of the 20% required for election.  The Tory surplus went strongly to Davidson, and the Lib Dem surplus then went strongly to the Labour candidate John Morgan.  Labour had started on 7.5% of the vote, which in the end was too far behind to come back from; Morgan can consider himself unlucky to have ended up eight votes behind Kahanov-Kloppert in the final count.  The seat count in Ellon and District remained at 2 SNP, 1 Conservative and 1 Lib Dem.

The blue tide in Aberdeenshire may not have affected the second nationalist seat in Ellon; but five weeks later it swept away Alex Salmond, who lost the Gordon parliamentary seat to the Conservative candidate Colin Clark on a similar swing of 20 percentage points.  Clark subsequently resigned his seat on Aberdeenshire council and the Conservatives held the resulting by-election in Inverurie. (You can read about that contest in <em>Andrew's Previews 2017</em>, page 283.)  When the December 2019 general election rolled around Salmond couldn't try and make one more political comeback as he was awaiting trial on rape and sexual assault charges (of which he was subsequently acquitted); Ellon councillor Richard Thomson returned as SNP candidate for Gordon, and defeated Clark on a 3% swing with a slim majority of 819 votes.

The SNP go into next year's Holyrood elections defending a larger majority in the local Aberdeenshire East constituency.  At the last Scottish Parliament elections in 2016 the SNP's Gillian Martin had held Alex Salmond's former seat with a 5,837 majority over Conservative candidate Colin Clark.  Also on the ballot in Aberdeenshire East that year was Lib Dem candidate Christine Jardine, who the following year was elected as MP for Edinburgh West.

This by-election will be closely watched as it's only the third party political by-election in Scotland since the 2019 general election, following a Conservative hold in Galloway in January and an independent hold on the Isle of Skye on 12th March.  (One thing that stuck out when I did the research for that Skye poll was that four of the six candidates worked or had worked in the accommodation/hospitality industry; goodness knows what experience they've had since.)  As it's a Scottish local by-election the Alternative Vote is in effect, and on the basis of the May 2017 result that should favour the Conservatives who would have won Ellon and District 61-39 in a straight fight with the SNP.  We can take that as the par score, so the Nationalists have an uphill struggle in defending their seat.

Defending for the SNP is Louise McAllister, the vice-chair of the Ellon community council; she is a humanist celebrant.  Hoping to clean up at the polls is the Conservative challenger John Crawley, who has travelled the world in the Royal Navy and now runs a power washing business in Ellon.  The Liberal Democrats have selected Trevor Mason, who has lived in Ellon for 36 years and is chair of the community council.  Completing the ballot paper are two candidates from further afield: John Bennett (from Stonehaven) for Labour and Peter Kennedy (from Aberdeen) for the Scottish Green Party.
