"All the right votes, but not necessarily in the right order"

For the moment, the show is going on.  There are four local by-elections on 19th March 2020:

<h2>Clackmannanshire East</h2>

Clackmannanshire council; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Bill Mason.

It's time for what is becoming the annual March trip to the Wee County on the north bank of the Firth of Forth.  For the third year in a row, Clackmannanshire council is having a by-election in March.  The returning officer is used to having to hold by-elections in trying circumstances: the March 2018 by-election in the county's North ward took place on the 1st of the month, ehich may be recognised by the Met Office as the first day of spring but was blighted by exceptionally heavy snowfall.

This time we're in the East ward, which is based on the towns of Clackmannan and Dollar.  Clackmannan may have given its name to a county but it's a pretty small place, with a population under 3,500.  Originally it was a port on the River Black Devon, a tributary of the Forth, but centuries of silting-up mean that the river is now more than a mile away from the town centre.  In mediaeval times Clackmannan was associated the Bruce family, who fortified it with the building of Clackmannan Tower - a structure that no longer exists.

Further up in the hills is Dollar, a village whose name may come from a Gaelic word meaning "dark" or "gloomy"; appropriate for the trying times in which we live.  By coincidence or otherwise, Dollar is home to Castle Gloom, a 500-year-old building officially called Castle Campbell which was built as a Lowland centre for the Dukes of Argyll.  Along with Muckhart, which was transferred into Clacks from Perthshire in 1971, Dollar forms one of the Hillfoots Villags along the A93 road from Stirling towards Fife.

Much of this ward has a coalmining history.  In 2003 Labour carried the two wards based on Clackmannan while Dollar and Muckhart was the only part of the Wee County to return a Conservative councillor, Alastair Campbell.  The inroduction of this ward for the 2007 election along with proportional representation enabled the SNP to get a look-in, and the nationalists actually topped the poll in Clackmannanshire East at the 2007 and 2012 elections.  For the May 2017 election the Conservatives took over the lead with 42% of the vote, against 30% for the SNP and 20% for Labour; the seat count remained at one for each party partly becuase the Tories only had one candidate.  Alastair Campbell stood down and Bill Mason took over as the ward's Conservative councillor.  As usual, Allan Faulds at the Ballot Box Scotland blog has got his slide-rule out to see what would have happened if the May 2017 votes were for a single seat: the answer is a big win for Mason, with a 59-41 lead over the SNP after redistributions.

The Wee County is part of the Ochil and South Perthshire parliamentary seat, which has unseated its MP at each of the three general elections over the last give years.  Labour's Gordon Banks lost in 2015 to the SNP's Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh, who lost in 2017 to the Tories' Luke Graham, who lost in 2019 to the SNP's John Nicolson.  Clackmannanshire has a longer SNP pedigree in the Scottish Parliament, the party having represented it since 2003 (currently as part of the Ochil and South Perthshire seat).

Bill Mason has stood down on health grounds halfway through his five-year term, prompting this by-election.  Derfending for the Conservatives is Denis Coyne, a busiuness advisor from Dollar who is aged 71, so may have some trouble getting to the count.  The SNP candidate is Stephen Leitch, a community councillor in Dollar.  Labour have selected Carolynne Hunter, a former software engineer and now full-time carer for her disabled daughter.  Also standing are John Biggam for the Lib Dems and Marion Robertson for the Scottish Greens.

<h2>Upper Stoke</h2>

Coventry council, West Midlands; caused by the death of Labour councillor Sucha Singh Bains at the age of 83.

Bains was born in the Punjab in 1935; he came to Britain in 1959 and settled in Coventry, studying at Lanchester Polytechnic - the forerunner to Coventry University - and working in the city's automotive industry.  Bains entered politics and in 1990 achieved elected office, being elected to Coventry city council for the Upper Stoke ward.  Apart from a gap in 2004-06 he had represented the ward ever since, and in 2003-04 Bains served as the first Asian Lord Mayor of Coventry.

Bains' Upper Stoke ward is centred on Stoke Heath, which was developed in the early years of the last century as housing for what was becoming a major industrial city.  Initially munitions were the major employer; there was a war on, and many of the local houses were occupied by refugees from Belgium.  Once the war was over the area became dependent on the Morris Motors engine plant, which occupied several acrea on Blackberry Lane.  Because of the presence of the factory, the area suffered badly in the Coventry Blitz of November 1940.  The Morris engine factory closed its doors in the early 1980s and housing now occupies the site.  Today many of the ward's residents were, like the late Councillor Bains, born in India; Punjabi and Polish are major languages spoken here.

Upper Stoke ward was unusual in Coventry in the 2000s as it was the only ward of the city where the Liberal Democrats had any sort of presence.  The Lib Dems won all three seats in the 2004 election, the first on the current boundaries, shutting Bains out.  Bains got his seat back in 2006 with a majority of 30 votes, and Labour gained a second seat the following year by the even narrower margin of three votes, 1620 to 1617.  The last Lib Dem councillor held out until 2012, but by then the Coalition had happened and the party's vote had fallen through the floor; Labour gained the seat with a majority of over 38 percentage points, and they have not been seriously challenged here since.  In May 2019 Labour polled 50% in Upper Stoke, against 21% for the Conservatives and 16% for UKIP; and the ward will have been strongly in the Labour column at the December 2019 general election in the Coventry North East constituency.

Defending for Labour is local resident Gurdev Singh Hayre.  The Conservatives have selectd Gurdeep Singh Sohal, a consultant.  UKIP - like the Lib Dems - have thrown in the towel, so the two remaining candidates are Chrissie Brown of the Green Party and Jane Nellist - wife of the former Militant MP Dave Nellist, now there's a blast from the past - for the Socialist Alternative.

<h2>Chilworth, Nursling and Rownhams</h2>

Test Valley council, Hampshire; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Nigel Anderdon.

Our two remaining by-elections are in the south-east of England.  Chilworth, Nursling and Rownhams are three villages just outside Southampton, whcch are clearly dependent on the big city but haven't been incoporated into it.  Chilworth, the point where Southampton ends on the main road towards Eastleigh and London, is home to a science park run by the University of Southampton and to the earth station from where Sky TV send their broadcasts to the satellites.  Rownhams lies on the city's north-western edge, and is probably best known as the location of a motorway service area on the M27 motorway.

This is greenbelt land and homes in this ward are sought-after and expensive.  That adds up to a strongly Conservative area; on slightly revised boundaries in May 2019, the ward gave the Conservative slate a 58-30 lead in what was generally a poor set of local elections for the Tories.  The Conservatives also hold the local county counil seat, Romsey Rural.

This by-election will be a straight fight with Labour having withdrawn.  Defending for the Conservatives is Terese Swain, a school business manager who site on Nursling and Rownhams parish council.  Challenging for the Lib Dems is Karen Dunleavey, a former Mayor of Romsey.
