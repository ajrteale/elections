CANTON, Cardiff city council; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Cerys Furlong, who is concentrating on her role as head of NIACE Dysgu Cymru, a Wales-wide adult learning body.

Treganna in Welsh, Canton goes back to mediaeval times as the site of South Wales' largest market.  There's still a fruit market in the area, but much of the ward was developed in the nineteenth century and became an area associated with immigrants to Cardiff; from Ireland in the mid-nineteenth century, from the subcontinent in the twentieth century.  The area is also starting to gentrify thanks to its proximity to the centre of Cardiff.  On the other side of the Great Western main line is the village of Leckwith on the left bank of the Ely, known for its sports; the city's athletics stadium is here, as is the Cardiff City Stadium, home of Cardiff City football club.  The Bluebirds are having a bad time on and off the field at the moment in their first Premier League season, with the manager being acrimoniously sacked over the New Year and a recent rebranding having changed the club colours from blue to red.

It might be argued that the club owner, Malaysian businessman Vincent Tan, was only reflecting the area's political orientation in rebranding the club, Canton being a safe Labour division after the party saw off a strong Plaid challenge at the 2008 election.  At the most recent poll in 2012 Labour polled 48% to 19% for Plaid and 16% for the Greens, who had not previously fought the division.  The Lib Dem candidate who finished bottom of the poll here in 2004, Alison Goldsworthy, is one of the alleged victims in the Lord Rennard sexual harassment case.

With Labour also performing well at a by-election last December in the neighbouring Riverside division, they will start as favourites to win the by-election.  Their candidate is Susan Elsmore, whose LinkedIn profile describes her as an independent public policy professional (whatever that means).  Translator Elin Tudur is the Plaid candidate.  The Greens have reselected Jake Griffiths, leader of the Welsh branch of the party and their top candidate here in 2012.  Also standing are Pam Richards for the Tories (who stood here in 2012), Matt Hemsley for the Lib Dems and Steffan Bateman for the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition.

BIRSTALL WANLIP, Charnwood district council, Leicestershire; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Stuart Jones at the age of 67.  A Leicester bus driver for some years, Jones had served on several council committees since first being elected in 2007, and was also a Birstall parish councillor.

"Mountsorrel he mounted at,
Rodely he rode by,
Onelep he leaped o'er,
At Birstall he burst his gall,
At Belgrave he was buried at."
-Leicestershire folk rhyme

Most of the electorate of this ward lives in the western half of Birstall, which until the start of the twentieth century was a tiny village on the edge of Leicester.  In 1899 the Great Central Railway came to Birstall and it became a commuter village; during the twentieth century the population increased eighteenfold to over 11,000.  The railway doesn't go to Leicester any longer, but has been turned into one of the UK's most ambitious preserved railways, with steam trains connecting the village with Loughborough at the weekends.

To the north of Birstall, on the other side of the A6, is the tiny village of Wanlip (163 electors, compared with 4818 in the three west Birstall polling districts); once the home of slavery abolitionist William Wilberforce, Wanlip is probably best known as the location of Leicestershire's sewage works.  Wilberforce's former home at Wanlip Hall supports a baronetcy, currently held by the Palmer family; the hall is now owned by an offshoot of that family, Charles Palmer-Tomkinson.  A Winter Olympian in 1964, competing for Britain in skiing (and son  and brother of other Olympic skiers), friend of the Prince of Wales and father of socialite and TV personality Tara, Palmer-Tomkinson is the ultimate landowner for most of this ward.

Charnwood is having a ridiculous number of by-elections at the moment; this is the seventh poll in the district since the last full council election in 2011, and the fourth in the last six months.  Historically Birstall is Charnwood's Lib Dem hotspot, the party splitting the two seats in this ward with the Conservatives in both 2003 and 2007, but the party was wiped out here in 2011, their defending councillor falling to third place behind the Tories and Labour (who didn't stand here in 2007).  The Birstall county division (which also includes the stronger Lib Dem ward of Birstall Watermead) was also a Tory gain from Lib Dem in last year's county council elections.

Defending for the Conservatives is Birstall parish councillor Mary Allen.  Labour have reselected Marilyn Cowles, who beat the alphabet to finish as runner-up in the 2011 district election.  Simon Sansome, the Lib Dems' county candidate here last year, stands for the district ward this time.  There are no minor party candidates, so that is your ballot paper.
