BLACKWOOD, Caerphilly county borough council; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Diana Ellis.

One of the classic mining towns of the South Welsh Valleys, Blackwood can be found in the Sirhowy valley.  Dating from the early nineteenth century it was originally intended as a model village, but clearly things went badly wrong; by the 1830s the terrible working conditions had led to a thriving Chartist group in the village.  Blackwood was the origin of the so-called Newport Rising of 1839, in which local Chartists marched from Blackwood to Newport in what was intended to be part of a national uprising.  Today the most visible reminder of this is the landmark Chartist Bridge, opened in 2005 over the deep Sirhowy valley; it forms part of a relief road taking traffic away from the town centre and intended to regenerate the area following the collapse of the coal industry.

Over the last decade Blackwood has been an Independent v Labour fight.  The three seats in the division split two to Labour and one to wildly popular independent councillor Kevin Etheridge at the 2004 election, the Independents gaining the two Labour seats in 2008.  Labour got a seat back in a July 2010 by-election, caused by Etheridge's resignation for family reasons, and went on to take the other two seats at the most recent ordinary election in 2012.

Defending for Labour is Allan Rees, whose main competition will come from former Independent councillor Keith Smallman, who lost his seat in 2012.  Also standing are regular Plaid candidate Andrew Farina-Childs, a former Mayor of Blackwood, and the Tories' regular by-election candidate for no-hope Caerphilly wards Cameron Muir-Jones.

SUTTON, East Cambridgeshire district council; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Peter Moakes in protest at proposals for council cuts and restructuring.  Moakes, who was leader of the council from 2011 to 2013, had been a Sutton ward councillor since 2007.

The large village of Sutton-in-the-Isle can be found about fifteen miles to the north of Cambridge.  It lies on an island in the Fens overlooking the two Bedford Rivers, artificial waterways which were built in the seventeenth century to contain the overflow of the River Great Ouse and prevent it from flooding the Fens.  Unsurprisingly given its presence in the Fens, Sutton has an agricultural history; its biggest export today is tractors, construction and agricultural equipment from Cheffins' monthly auction, which is described as one of the biggest machinery auctions in Europe.

The ward is safely Conservative but its two seats split evenly between the Tories and Lib Dems in 2003 after the Conservatives only fielded one candidate.  At the most recent election in 2011 Labour took second place from the Lib Dems.  The Sutton county seat (which covers a wider area) is also safely Conservative.  Nonetheless the local Conservative party appears to be in some disarray; as well as the by-election having been caused by the resigning councillor being unhappy about council policy, the remaining district councillor for the ward Philip Read, who is also the local county councillor, has been so annoyed by the selection process for this by-election that he has resigned from the Conservative party and gone independent.

That selection process produced Ely resident Neil Hitchin, an architectural conservationist and historian, as the Conservative candidate.  Labour have selected Jane Francis, from Little Downham, who stood in the Ely East district by-election last September.  The Liberal Democrat candidate is local resident Lorna Dupre, the parliamentary candidate for North East Cambridgeshire in 2010 and runner-up in the 2013 county election here.  There's no UKIP track record in Sutton at local or county level but Cambridgeshire is a good area for them, so it will be interesting to see if their candidate Daniel Devine can exploit the splits in the Conservative camp; Devine also lives in Little Downham and is the county councillor for Littleport.

HORNCASTLE, East Lindsey district council; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Steve Newton.

The market town of Horncastle can be found on the River Bain, about 20 miles east of Lincoln.  The Romans built a fort here, but it took until the thirteenth century for the town to become prosperous thanks to its annual horse fair, which continued well into the twentieth century.  Horncastle holds the UK's three-hour rainfall record, with 178mm falling in a cloudburst in 1960; flooding in the town is a recurring problem, and local folklore says that when the town changes its vicar a major flood will follow soon afterwards (although this didn't happen last time the vicar changed in 1999).

The Horncastle ward (which also includes the small village of Thimbleby to the west) is not closely contested politically, and its three seats have been split Tory/Lib Dem/Independent since the current ward was created in 2003.  Throughout this period the Conservatives have only ever stood one candidate (Newton, although in 2003 he was the independent councillor) and the second Lib Dem candidate generally polls terribly.  Newton topped the poll at the most recent election in 2011.  At county level the larger Horncastle and Tetford division had two consecutive photo-finish results: the Tories won by just ten votes from independent candidate William Aron at the 2005 election before losing the seat to him by two votes four years later; Aron, part of the well-organised Lincolnshire Independents county council group, was easily re-elected last year.

Defending for the Tories is Richard Avison, who lost a district council by-election to UKIP last year but this time is standing on home turf.  David Roark, who runs a garden landscaping company, stands as an independent candidate, and the ballot paper is completed by UKIP's Mike Beecham, a software developer from the village of Hemingby.

OSBOURNBY, North Kesteven district council, Lincolnshire; caused by the death of Independent councillor Jim Cook at the age of 70.  An Osbournby parish councillor for more than 30 years, Cook had first been elected to the district council in 2007.

The Osbournby ward covers the sparsely-populated rural area south of Sleaford, a grouping of eleven tiny parishes.  Osbournby itself (the B is silent) is a village at the centre of the ward on the A15 Lincoln-Peterborough road, but the largest parish within the ward is in fact Wilsford on the A153 Sleaford-Grantham road, which has 342 electors on the roll.  The smallest parish in the ward appears to be Walcot near Folkingham in the south of ward, which has just 47 electors.

Jim Cook had had a near-miss in the 2003 election to this ward, which he lost to the Conservatives by nine votes.  The 2007 election was another photofinish, but this time Cook was first over the line to gain the seat from the Conservatives with a majority of seventeen votes.  At his re-election in 2011 Cook won very comfortably with almost 70% of the vote in a straight fight with the Tories.  The local county division (Sleaford Rural South) is safely Conservative with Labour second in 2005, the Lincolnshire Independents as runners-up in 2009 and UKIP taking a strong second place in the 2013 county elections (38% to 50% for the Tories).

None of the candidates for this by-election live in the ward.  The new independent candidate for the ward is Fay Cooper who represents the Lincolnshire Independents group; she lives in Leasingham, just north of Sleaford, and contested that area in the most recent county and district elections.  Charity fundraiser Kate Cook, from Sleaford, is the Conservative candidate.  Also standing are Robert Greentham for Labour and Tony Richardson for the Lib Dems, both of whom give addresses in villages south of Lincoln.
