It may be referendum day in Scotland, but in the rump UK political life goes on as normal (for now) with three local by-elections on 18th September.  Labour are defending seats in Oxford and on the North Wales coast (for which see Welsh Elections), while there is an independent defence in County Durham.

ABERGELE PENSARN, Conwy county borough council, North Wales; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Jean Stubbs.

This is a coastal division, covering the part of the town of Abergele to the east of the A55, the main road through North Wales.  The double-barrelled name is partly to reflect the name of the ward's railway station (Abergele and Pensarn, on the North Wales Coast line) and partly because Conwy county borough has another Pensarn division, in Llandudno Junction.  The division has a very high retired population; 28% of the population is retired according to the 2011 census, which also found 45% of the population identifying as English; however, Abergele has a reputation for being rather downmarket compared to other retirement communities on the North Wales Coast.

Stubbs had been councillor for Abergele Pensarn since at least 2004, although with interrupted service: she lost her seat to the Conservatives in 2008 before getting it back in 2012, in which election the Tories fell to third place behind an independent candidate.

There will still be a Stubbs on the ballot paper, as Jean's husband Rick is the defending Labour candidate.  In a crowded independent field, Abergele town councillor Ken Sudlow, the runner-up in the 2012 election, is standing again, and is joined by flood warden Barry Griffiths, former NHS senior manager Val Parker, and Kinmel Bay resdent Michael Smith.  Another town councillor on the ballot is the Tories' John Pitt, who gives an address in the interior village of Llanfair Talhaiarn.  Completing the ballot paper is the division's first UKIP candidate, Sarah Wardlaw.

CROOK, Durham council; caused by the death of Independent councillor Eddie Murphy at the age of 69.  A former RAF air traffic controller who had also worked as a welfare officer for the former Durham city council and as a pub landlord, Murphy had been a councillor for Crook for almost twenty years, originally being elected for Labour; he served twice as chairman of the former Wear Valley district council.

This wonderfully-named market town can be found in the hills above Weardale, about five miles north-west of Bishop Auckland.  It's a town of relatively recent vintage which grew from a tiny hamlet in the early Victorian period thanks to coalmining; with the mines now exhausted Crook has declined to the status of a small market town.

The Liberal Democrats had some strength in Crook during the later years of the last Labour government; when Wear Valley district council was abolished in 2009 they held most of the district council seats covered by the present division, and in the first unitary Durham council elections in 2008 the Lib Dems won both seats in Crook North and Tow Law, the seats in Crook South being split by Labour and Eddie Murphy with the Lib Dems close behind; part of the modern Crook division was also then in the Willington division where the Tories topped the poll.  New division boundaries introduced last year united Crook into a single three-seat division, Murphy being re-elected at the top of the poll and Labour winning the other two seats.  There were significant votes in the 2013 election for an Independent slate and for the "Wear Valley Independents", with the Lib Dem vote crashing.  One of the Labour councillors died shortly after the 2013 election and Labour easily held the resulting by-election, held last November, with the Independent and Wear Valley Independent candidates being evenly balanced.

The independent candidate defending this by-election is Tony Simpson, from Crook; with the Wear Valley Independent Group having thrown in the towel his chances of election have been greatly improved.  Labour have selected Maureen Stanton, who runs a local call centre.  The Lib Dems' David English is having his third crack at the ward in two years and is the only candidate to have also contested last year's by-election.  Also standing are Alan Booth for the Conservatives and Betty Hopson for UKIP.

QUARRY AND RISINGHURST, Oxford city council; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Laurence Baxter who has a new job as a history teacher in Prague.

This ward is on the eastern outskirts of Oxford, straddling the eastern bypass and lying immediately to the south of the Headington Roundabout.  This is the first part of Oxford which drivers entering the city from London will see.  The Quarry refers to Headington Quarry, a residential area which is actually built in a former quarrying area (many Oxford colleges were built out of stone from the quarry).  While Headington Quarry is a leafy area full of educated people, Risinghurst outside the ring road is an inter-war estate built to house workers at the motor factories in Oxford.  One notable former resident is the author and Oxford academic C S Lewis, who lived in Risinghurst.

This sort of profile, together with Oxford's active Labour party, produces a ward which is generally Labour except for a single Lib Dem win at the 2004 election.  The Lib Dem councillor stood for re-election as a Conservative in 2008 and came second, in the closest the perennially-useless Oxford Tories have come to winning a seat on the city council for decades.  At county level Quarry comes under the Headington and Quarry division, which was won by the Lib Dems in 2013 by just 31 votes over Labour, while Risinghurst is part of the safe-Labour division of Barton, Sandhills and Risinghurst.

Defending for Labour is Chewe Munkonge, who works in audit at Lloyds Bank.  The Lib Dems have selected Roz Smith, county councillor for Headington and Quarry division and runner-up in last May's city council election.  The Tory candidate is environmental scientist Katharine Harborne, while midwife and former Risinghurst and Sandhills parish councillor Liz Taylor stands for the Green Party.  Completing the ballot paper is Julia Gasper of the English Democrats, who stood for this area several times as a UKIP candidate before being forced out of the party for being a homophobe.
