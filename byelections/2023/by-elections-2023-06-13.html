One by-election on Tuesday 13th June 2023:

<h2>St Peters</h2>

St Albans council, Hertfordshire; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Danny Clare.

There will be a bit of a rush of polls for the next month, as Returning Officers and local parties across the country try to clear the decks in advance of the long summer holidays.  For this week and next in particular, Andrew's Previews will be concentrating on the unfinished business from 4th May: because of this, there will be eleven council seats up for election on Thursday.

But before then, we've come to Hertfordshire's only city.  St Albans goes back a long way.  It's named after St Alban, who lived here in what was then a Roman city called Verulamium in the third or fourth centuries and was martyred here for his Christian faith.  Alban's grave became a place of pilgrimage, and a church was built in his memory which is recorded as being here by at least AD 429.  The church became an abbey, and in the nineteenth century it was raised to the status of cathedral.  At the same time, the town of St Albans was granted city status.

Not far from the the cathedral there is a crossroads in the city centre, where the A5 and A6 roads once bounced off each other.  The road running north from this junction towards Luton passes the city's market place and runs in a more or less straight line to St Peter's church, which gives its name to this ward.  St Albans was a major place of pilgrimage as the burial-place of England's first martyr, and St Peter's - which is thought to have been founded in the tenth century - was one of a number of churches in the city that were built to receive visiting pilgrims.  TV viewers may recognise St Peter's as the venue for the second wedding of <em>EastEnders</em>' Ricky Butcher and Bianca Jackson in 2010.

The city has always had good transport links with London, starting with the Roman road of Watling Street.  The railways came in 1868, and St Albans City station is a major London commuter station: in offpeak hours ten Thameslink trains depart south every hour for St Pancras, Blackfriars and destinations beyond.

And this gives St Peters ward one of the clearest examples of a commuter demographic the 2021 census has to offer.  The ward is in the top 100 in England and Wales for higher managerial (34.7%) and lower managerial (27.8%) occupations, for full-time employment (53.5%), for adults educated to degree level (66.5%) and for the 30-44 age bracket (32.2%).  Interestingly St Peters ranks third of all the England and Wales for households with precisely one car or van, at 56.2%.

St Albans City and District Council (as the council likes to style itself) has been in and out of no overall control quite a lot over this century, partly thanks to its thirds electoral cycle and partly because the Conservativea and Liberal Democrats both had significant bases of support in the district.  St Peters ward has in fact voted for all four main parties since 2002 (the last time Labour won here), and in 2011 it was the first ward in the city to return a Green Party councillor, Simon Grover.  Grover was re-elected in 2012, 2016 (by six votes), 2021, 2022 (on new boundaries) and 2023; in 2021 and 2022 he was not opposed by the Liberal Democrats in what appears to have been an electoral pact.  With all four main parties having significant votes in this ward, freak vote splits are common: in 2014 the Conservatives won St Peters with just 25.6% of the vote, and less than 5% separated them from the fourth-placed Labour candidate.

The Lib Dems gained the St Albans parliamentary seat in 2019 for the first time, followed by overall control of St Albans council in 2021.  An all-out council election the following year on new ward boundaries then delivered a Lib Dem landslide, as the Conservative group was almost wiped out.  The latest composition gives 48 Lib Dem councillors plus this vacancy against four Conservatives, two Greens and an independent.

As stated, St Peters ward voted Green last month.  This time the electoral pact broke down and Grover faced a Lib Dem challenger for the first time since 2016; he was re-elected with 46% of the vote, against 33% for the Lib Dems.  The Liberal Democrats hold the other two seats in St Peters ward, and one of those seats is up in this by-election following the resignation of Danny Clare.

Clare had been a St Albans councillor since 2019, when he was elected for the neighbouring Clarence ward.  Following boundary changes in 2022 he transferred to St Peters ward and was elected in second place in the all-out election.  That meant Clare got a two-year term, so the winner of the by-election to replace him will need to seek re-election in May 2024.

Defending this interesting ward for the Lib Dems is David Partridge, who was runner-up here in May's election; Partridge has previously contested a St Albans by-election, finishing as a distant runner-up to Labour in Batchwood ward in 2012.  The Greens will be hoping for a gain with their candidate Juliet Voisey, a childcare provider who does a lot of volunteer work in the city.  Also standing are Ambrose Killen for the Conservatives and David Byatt for Labour.
