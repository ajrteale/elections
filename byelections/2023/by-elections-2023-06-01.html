"All the right votes, but not necessarily in the right order"

</p><p>
One by-election on 1st June 2023:
</p><p>
<h2>South Hampstead</h2>
</p><p>
Camden council, London; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Will Prince.
</p><p>
June is shaping up to be a reasonably busy month for the Previews, as we consider the unfinished business from May's elections.  However, there's a slow start to the month with just one poll taking place on the first day of the month.
</p><p>

</p><p>
If you arrive into London by train on the main lines from the Chilterns or the West Coast, you'll enter a tunnel shortly before arriving at your terminus.  This was the railway navigators' solution to the natural obstacle of Primrose Hill.  South Hampstead is the point where these tunnels start.  South Hampstead station itself lies at the southern end of this ward, on the Overground route from Euston to Watford, while the Chiltern route and the Metropolitan and Jubilee Lines of the Underground dive into tunnel at the north-east corner of the ward before turning south towards Marylebone and Baker Street.  Three Jubilee Line stations (West Hampstead, Finchley Road and Swiss Cottage) lie on the boundary of this ward, and Metropolitan Line trains also call at Finchley Road.
</p><p>
Finchley Road itself is the major route for road traffic travelling from the north towards London's West End.  On the eastern boundary of the ward there is a short triangular one-way system, in the middle of which is a pub dating from 1804 which was built in the style of a Swiss chalet.  This is the Swiss Cottage, which gave its name to an electoral ward of Camden until boundary changes for the 2022 election moved the Cottage itself into a neighbouring ward.  A new name was needed for the area, and South Hampstead was the result.
</p><p>
A large number of the street names in the ward end in "Gardens", but don't be fooled.  South Hampstead ward is almost entirely built-up with terraced housing which has clearly been subdivided into flats: in the 2021 census 93% of the ward's households were flats or apartments, which is a figure in the top 40 wards in England and Wales.  The census return paints a picture of professionals being the people who live in those flats or apartments: the ward is in the top 50 for those in higher managerial or professional occupations (38.3%), which is the most middle-class of the seven occupational groups recognised by the ONS.  68% of the workforce are educated to degree level or higher.  South Hampstead makes the top 50 wards in England and Wales for Judaism (7.5%) and the top 90 for Buddhism (1.7%).  And this being London, there is a fair amount of immigration here particularly from western Europe: South Hampstead ranks in the top 30 wards for the White Other ethnic group (30.4%), in the top 40 for those born in an EU-14 state (14.1%) and in the top 70 for those born in an European non-EU state (5.1%).  That latter category includes Switzerland, which is appropriate for a ward which used to be called Swiss Cottage.
</p><p>
This being London, there are also a number of nationally-known figures who have previously represented Swiss Cottage ward on Camden council.  The future Labour culture secretary Tessa Jowell started her political career by being elected as a councillor here in 1971, when she was just 23 years old.  Jowell served the ward for three years, rising to become chair of the council's social services committee.
</p><p>
In 1974 Jowell moved to Gospel Oak ward, which was a good thing from her point of view because Swiss Cottage fell to the Conservatives.  Their slate included Tony Kerpel, who had spent much of the previous four years as personal assistant to the Prime Minister Edward Heath.  Kerpel became chairman of the Young Conservatives and, in time, leader of Camden council's Conservative group.  He served as a councillor here for four years, until being displaced to Belsize ward by boundary changes in 1978.
</p><p>
Another former councillor for Swiss Cottage ward who was notable on the national stage was the Conservatives' Derek Spencer, a barrister and KC who passed away last month at the age of 87.  Spencer was elected here in 1982, but left Camden council the following year after being elected as Conservative MP for Leicester South.  That was the first of his two non-consecutive parliamentary terms.  After being defeated in Leicester South in 1987 Spencer returned to the Commons in 1992 as the last (to date) Conservative MP for Brighton Pavilion, and he served as Solicitor General throughout the second term of the Major government.
</p><p>
Swiss Cottage ward proved to be a marginal area of Camden which was normally Conservative-inclined but which Labour were capable of winning in a good year.  However, it has swung hard to the left in recent years in line with much of inner London.  At the 2018 local elections, Labour won all three seats in Swiss Cottage ward for the first time since 1994 - one of the defeated Conservative candidates in 2018 was Calvin Robinson, who has since carved out a niche for himself on GB News.  At the first election on the current boundaries in May last year, South Hampstead ward looked quite safe for Labour who led the Conservatives 54-31.
</p><p>
This swing to Labour also reflects parliamentary results in the area.  South Hampstead is part of the Hampstead and Kilburn constituency, whose Labour MP Tulip Siddiq inherited a majority of 42 votes from Glenda Jackson in 2015 and was re-elected for a third term in December 2019 almost 15,000 votes ahead of the Conservatives.
</p><p>
The Labour slate elected here in 2022 included Will Prince, who resigned from the council in April because he is leaving these shores and relocating to America for work.  He had served as a councillor for just under a year.
</p><p>
Defending for Labour is Tommy Gale, who works for Enfield council as a social worker and Unison rep and has founded a charity supporting social mobility.  The Conservatives have reselected Don Williams, who represented most of this area as a councillor for Swiss Cottage ward from 2002 to 2018; he was runner-up here last year, beating the alphabet to finish as the top Conservative candidate.  Also standing are Patrick Stillman for the Lib Dems and Lorna Russell for the Green Party.

<h2>When election administration goes wrong, and how to fix it</h2>
</p><p>
Since it's a slow week on the by-election front, we've time to discuss some of the things which went wrong in May's local elections from a procedural point of view.  Now, when did you last have a day where everything went right in <em>your</em> job?  Well, elections are also hard things to get right and even the professionals sometimes make errors.  I am grateful to Colin Gray for pulling together some of the research on which this section is based.
</p><p>
One major cockup which did the rounds on the more left-wing corners of Twitter last month came from the offices of North Lincolnshire council, where the declared result for Broughton and Scawby ward gave 528 and 525 votes to the winning Conservative candidates, respectively Carol Ross and Janet Lee.  The runner-up, Labour's Michael Compton, was credited with 367 votes.  At some point afterwards it was discovered that 864 postal votes had not been included in the count.  This sounds like rather a large number of votes to miss, but North Lincolnshire isn't the first council to overlook a ballot box during the count and they won't be the last - the Local Elections Archive Project has details of a number of previous similar cases over the last 21 years.  Given that the uncounted votes were postal votes, where the Conservatives normally perform better than average, this column has little reason to believe that Councillors Ross and Lee were elected wrongly.
</p><p>
A rather more significant and unfortunate error happened before the election in Ribble Valley district.  This council got new ward boundaries this year, which meant that the electoral register had to be updated to take account of the new lines.  In doing this, two streets comprising 62 households which should have been on the register for Whalley and Painter Wood ward were wrongly allocated to the neighbouring ward of Whalley Nethertown.  Because the two wards share the same polling station, the error was not noticed until election day.  The outcome of this is that approximately 20 votes were cast in the wrong ward.
</p><p>
This error might well have resulted in the wrong candidates being elected and affected control of the council, because as bad luck would have it both of those wards turned in very close results.  In Whalley and Painter Wood the elected candidates were the Conservatives' Mark Hindle with 336 votes and independent John Atherton with 327 votes; they have majorities of 15 and 6 votes over the runner-up, the second Conservative candidate Gerald Mirfin.  Whalley Nethertown, which mostly consists of a rather new housing development on the site of a former mental hospital, turned in a very close three-way result: 18-year-old Labour candidate Aaron Wilkins-Odudu, a cousin of the TV presenter AJ Odudu, won with 137 votes against 127 for the Conservatives' David Berryman and 125 for independent candidate Catherine Lord-Green.  If the Conservative runners-up in both wards had been elected, the Tories would have finished with 20 out of 40 seats on the council and would have been able to rule alone thanks to the chairman's casting vote; instead, the Ribble Valley Conservatives are three seats short of a majority and will have to rely on the votes of independent councillors to get their programme through.
</p><p>
What's going to be done to correct these errors?  Well, it appears that in these cases nothing will be done.  Once the result is declared, that's that and the only forum for grievances is the Election Court.  The Conservatives in Ribble Valley appear to have a strong case that the elections in both Whalley and Painter Wood and Whalley Nethertown wards should be voided and rerun in their entirety, but the candidates involved have reportedly decided not to apply to the Court because doing so is an extremely expensive process - the legal fees involved will get into five figures without even trying -and the money simply can't be raised.  Labour in North Lincolnshire have a good case that the result in Broughton and Scawby ward should be recounted and the Election Court has the power to order that, but there's no guarantee that a recount would change the outcome of the election; if a Court-ordered recount found that the Conservatives were in fact the rightful winners (as they probably were), then Labour would lose the case and would have to pay the Conservatives' legal costs.  In case you're wondering, the returning officer does not have the power to apply to the Election Court on their own behalf; the burden of proving the case before the Court falls on the candidate or electors who bring the case.
</p><p>
There were also a couple of occasions in the Northern Irish elections where counts finished prematurely.  In Ards and North Down, the Ards Peninsula DEA counting team appear to have stopped after the fifth count with five candidates having reached quota; Pete Wray of the Ulster Unionist Party was then declared as the winner of the final seat 103.41 votes ahead of Sinn Féin's Noel Sands, despite the fact that there were still 436.32 surplus votes from elected candidates yet to be thrown.  Almost all of these were DUP surplus votes which would be extremely unlikely to transfer to Sinn Féin, so there can be little question that Wray would in fact have gone on in to win had the count been fully completed.
</p><p>
There is more room for doubt in the Waterside DEA of Derry City and Strabane, where the sixth-count result had five candidates at or over quota, one SDLP candidate (Sean Mooney) close enough to the quota that he would clearly have been elected in due course, and the seventh seat declared as going to the other SDLP candidate Martin Reilly with a margin of 49.16 votes over the Alliance Party's Philip McKinney.  That margin could have been overturned by 164.11 DUP surplus votes which should have been transferred and were not.  In this case the latest report to hand at the time of writing suggests that the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland (as returning officer) and Alliance's election agent were co-operating with each other to bring a petition to the Election Court for a recount.
</p><p>
These cases highlight the need for reform of the Election Court, which is a nineteenth-century legal process that is no longer fit for purpose.  Electoral fraud trials might catch the headlines on the rare occasions they occur, but most of the Election Court's work is to resolve administrative errors by
the returning officer and the count staff.  That's akin to using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.  Even in reasonably clear-cut cases like these where the fault obviously lies with the returning officer or their staff and not with the candidate, the costs involved are far too high for the Court to be an effective remedy for a candidate who was not elected when they should have been.
</p><p>
What can be done to reform this process?  Well, here are some suggestions which might or might not prove workable, but will hopefully form a constructive basis for debate.  Allowing the returning officer, who can rely on public liability insurance to cover most of the legal costs, to bring cases to the Court on their own initiative would be a welcome start on bringing the Election Court process into the twenty-first century.  The Electoral Commission already have functions relating to performance standards for returning officers, and beefing that role up into something similar to an Electoral Ombudsman Service might also help in rectifying errors and improving access to justice for error cases like these.  Perhaps the cheapest and most effective solution would be to give returning officers the power, or clarify that they already have the power, to take certain steps to resolve errors.  Maybe last year's Election Act could have made a positive difference in this field, instead of wasting money on unnecessary photo ID provisions.
</p><p>
None of this is intended as an attack on returning officers and their staff, merely a recognition that despite the best efforts of everyone involved mistakes can and do happen - and that the complaints process to resolve those mistakes is not adequate.  If your bank made an error that caused you to lose money, you would expect them to take reasonable steps to put that right.  Your returning officer, or perhaps some sort of ombudsman, should also have the power to take reasonable steps to put right errors that affect the result of your elections, instead of you having to spend a fortune on an antiquated legal process to force such a correction.  Let's hope that reform of the Election Court, to improve the handling of cases like these, is just around the corner.
