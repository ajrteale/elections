<h2>Hutton Rudby and Osmotherley</h2>

North Yorkshire council; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Bridget Fortune.

More spectacular countryside awaits in our next by-election, which is partly located in the North York Moors National Park.  This is located on relatively high ground to the east of the Vale of York, and it's at the point where the high plateau stops and the Vale begins that we find Hutton Rudby and Osmotherley division.  Travellers on the A19 dual carriageway towards Teesside, which skirts the edge of the National Park, will be familiar with the sight.

At the point where the high ground peels away to the right there is a road junction, where travellers can stay on the main road towards Middlesbrough or turn right towards Redcar and Cleveland.  That junction is named after the hotel here, the Cleveland Tontine.  This hotel was built in 1804 during the age when the A19 was a turnpike road, and its name recalls how it was originally financed.  A tontine (named after a seventeenth-century Neapolitan banker, Lorenzo de Tonti, who had the original idea) is a form of investment vehicle in which the subscribers to a scheme get their money back in the form of an annuity; once a subscriber died, the payouts to the remaining subscribers increased because there were fewer people to distribute the annual payments to.  Once all the original subscribers were dead, the scheme would be wound up.  Tontines were quite popular investments in the 18th and 19th centuries, and a number of eighteenth-century projects including Richmond Bridge over the Thames, the Bath Assembly Rooms and the Tontine Coffee House in New York (the original home of the New York Stock Exchange) owe their existence to this now almost-forgotten form of fundraising.

Not far to the south of the Cleveland Tontine lie the well-preserved ruins of Mount Grace Priory, a Carthusian foundation of 1398 which was the last monastery established in Yorkshire before the Dissolution.  Do make sure you visit in March or April when the daffodils are in flower - it's quite a sight.  Next to the priory ruins lies a manor house which was restored in the Arts and Crafts style around 1900 by Sir Isaac Lowthian Bell, who has appeared in this column before.  Bell made his fortune in the Teesside ironworking industry, and was elected to the Royal Society in 1874 for his work on metallurgy; in the same year he was elected as a Liberal MP for North Durham, but this was voided by the Election Court for intimidation by the Liberal campaign.  Bell did, however, get back into the Commons fairly quickly: he served as Liberal MP for The Hartlepools from 1875 to 1880.

The villages within this ward are generally within commuting distance of Teesside, and a number of Middlesbrough FC stars (including Paul Gascoigne at one point) have lived in the largest village within this division.  Hutton Rudby, which has around 1,348 electors according to the notice of poll for this election, is the final resting place of Sir Rex Hunt who was governor of the Falkland Islands at the time of the Argentine invasion.  Nearby can be found the village of Potto, home of the haulage company Prestons of Potto whose lorries are a familiar sight on the A19 and further afield.

The whole of this division is within the constituency of the Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak.  His Richmond (Yorkshire) seat covers an enormous area, running from the Yorkshire Dales all the way across to the North York Moors here.  The seat is also rather misnamed: Richmond has the history but the largest town here is in fact Northallerton, and this will be reflected at the next general election when Sunak's constituency will be renamed as "Richmond and Northallerton".

Northallerton is the home of North Yorkshire council, which is the local authority here following a recent reorganisation; Hambleton district council, which once covered this area, was abolished in May.  The current North Yorkshire council was elected in 2022 for a five-year term; the Conservatives won a slim majority of 47 out of 90 seats, which has since disappeared as a result of defections and a by-election loss to the Liberal Democrats earlier this year.  The latest count has 44 Conservatives plus this vacancy, 17 independent councillors (some of whom are allied with the Conservatives), 12 Lib Dems, 11 Labour, 5 Greens, 1 continuing Liberal, and 1 councillor who left Labour and successfully sought re-election in a recent by-election for his own Social Justice Party.  If the Tories lose this by-election, they will be in a minority and no longer able to rely on the casting vote of the chair.

47 Conservative seats in North Yorkshire was a pretty poor return anyway, and it could have been worse as we see from the inaugural result in Hutton Rudby last year: just 40% for the Conservatives' Bridget Fortune in what should be true-blue countryside, 29% for independent candidate David Hugill and 24% for the Liberal Democrats.  Partly this is explained by a split in the Conservative vote.  Fortune and Hugill were both at the time long-serving Hambleton councillors for the area (Fortune representing Hutton Rudby, Hugill sitting for Osmotherley and Swainby), and Hugill was the sitting Conservative county councillor for the predecessor division of North Hambleton.

Bridget Fortune resigned from North Yorkshire council over the summer, following a bizarre incident at the council's annual meeting in May in which a Conservative whip physically intervened to prevent her casting a vote against the administration.  The whip involved, councillor Tom Jones, immediately apologised; but rumour has it that Fortune's resignation letter, which the council has refused to publish, contains bullying allegations.

Defending for the Conservatives is the independent candidate from last time David Hugill, a farmer and market trader from Faceby (a village within the ward), who now has the chance to resume his local government career.  Also returning from the last election here is the Lib Dems candidate Duncan Ross Russell, a former Army Major with service in the Balkans, Iraq and Afghanistan under his belt; he lives in Osmotherley and now works as a project manager.  Also standing are Lee Derrick for the regionalist Yorkshire Party and Allan Mortimer, who is the chairman of Rudby parish council, for the Green Party.  Labour also put in a set of nomination papers but their candidate has withdrawn and will not be on the ballot, which leaves a field of four candidates for the electors to choose from.

<h2>Bushbury South and Low Hill</h2>

Wolverhampton council, West Midlands; caused by the death of the Leader of the Council, Labour councillor Ian Brookfield.

Our Labour defence of the week comes in the city of Wolverhampton.  We've come to Bushbury, a former village located a couple of miles north of Wolverhampton city centre which has long disappeared into the urban sprawl of the Black Country.  Most of the urban sprawl here comes from Low Hill, which was developed in the 1920s as a very large council estate by Wolverhampton Corporation; more than half of the houses in the ward are still rented, mostly on social terms.

In those days there was a lot of employment in local factories, particularly the large Goodyear tyre plant on the Stafford Road; but manufacturing here isn't what it used to be.  The 2021 census return for Bushbury South and Low Hill ward, which then had different boudnaries, placed it within the top 100 wards in England and Wales for unemployment (7.1%) and for children aged under 16 (27.8%).  The Goodyear plant is now a redevelopment site, which was transferred out of the ward by boundary changes in May.

Those boundary changes mean that the western boundary of this ward is now defined not by the Stafford Road but by railway lines and canals.  Trains approaching Wolverhampton from the north reach a three-way junction at Bushbury; passenger trains head for the city centre station, but the original line here is actually the south-eastern route towards Bescot.  This was the original route of the Grand Junction Railway between Birmingham and Newton-le-Willows, which opened in 1837 and took a route between the high ground of Bushbury Hill, Low Hill and Wolverhampton city centre.  Back in the day this was a busy intercity route; but now passenger trains only use it as a diversion.

This area is within the Wolverhampton North East parliamentary seat, which was one of the 40 seats named within the original Red Wall and was a Conservative gain in the 2019 general election.  Its MP is Jane Stevenson, a Tory backbencher and former opera singer.  Our very own Ben Walker's notional calculations (<a href="https://sotn.newstatesman.com/2023/09/new-constituency-boundaries-mean">link</a>) reckon that the Conservatives narrowly carried Bushbury South and Low Hill in December 2019, and they certainly had a good time across Wolverhampton in that election.  Walker projects that the revised Wolverhampton North East is the safest Conservative seat in the city on the new boundaries.

However, in local elections Wolverhampton city council is normally a Labour-controlled authority; there has been a few years of Conservative leadership over the 50 years since the modern metropolitan borough council was first elected in 1973, but the Tories have never had a majority here.  The council has had a Labour majority continuously since 2011, and in 2019 Labour's Ian Brookfield took over as leader of the council.

Brookfield was first elected here as long ago as 1995, gaining what was then Bushbury ward from the Conservatives.  He was re-elected in 1999 in Oxley ward, lost his seat to the Conservatives there in 2007, returned in 2012 as councillor for Fallings Park ward, served as Mayor of Wolverhampton in 2015-16, and transferred back to Bushbury South and Low Hill in 2021.  His council leadership also came with a seat on the West Midlands Combined Authority, on which Brookfield held the economy and innovation portfolio.  By trade Brookfield was a nurse; politically he was red, but in football he was a blue - an Evertonian.

Ian Brookfield stood for re-election in May this year despite a diagnosis of cancer, and was re-elected easily in Bushbury South and Low Hill which is one of the safest Labour wards in the city.  The Labour slate defeated the Conservatives here 65-23; on the previous 2004-23 boundaries, Labour had never lost this ward and fell below 50% only once.  Overall Labour won 44 seats on Wolverhampton coucil, the other 16 going to the Conservatives.  But in the end Brookfield couldn't defeat his cancer; he passed away in July at the age of 57.

Ian Brookfield had finished second in this year's all-out election, behind his wife Paula who topped the poll, so the winner of this by-election will take over a three-year term and will need to seek re-election in 2026.  The defending Labour candidate in this by-election is their son, Paul Brookfield.  Standing for the Conservatives is Rob Williams, who stood in the neighbouring Fallings Park ward in May and runs a fitness-themed YouTube channel, <em>Burpees and Bells</em>.  Also on the ballot are Ian Jenkins for the Lib Dems and Mohammed Nassem for the Green Party.
