Three by-elections on 23rd March 2023:

<h2>Rushden South</h2>

North Northamptonshire council; caused by the death of Conservative councillor David Jenney.

There's only a bit over a month to go now to the May 2023 local elections, and this column doesn't have much to talk about over the next few weeks.  There are only eight by-elections scheduled between now and then; three of those take place today and two of those are non-partisan contests in the City of London.  The Rushden South by-election is the only poll today in which party politics will play a roll.

So let's take a trip to Rushden, a town of just over 30,000 souls on the southern edge of Northamptonshire.  Together with its satellite town of Higham Ferrers, this is quite a large urban area which is not that much smaller than the main towns of North Northamptonshire - Corby, Kettering and nearby Wellingborough.  However, Rushden is rather off the beaten track: Wellingborough is the nearest railhead, and the town's road links are not that great either.  As with many Northamptonshire towns, boot and shoemaking were the traditional industries here; despite competition from abroad, Rushden still has four shoe factories employing local people.

However, the boot and shoe industry in Northamptonshire has declined a long way from its heyday.  Manufacturing is not a major sector of Rushden's economy now; instead the wholesale trade and (despite what I said earlier) transport are major employers in Rushden South according to the 2021 census.

We are in the local government disaster of Northamptonshire at the moment, a county which has seen its local government reorganised in the last few years following the financial failure of Northamptonshire county council.  This has resulted in the county being divided into two new unitary councils, which is how Rushden has ended up as part of North Northamptonshire district despite being on the southern edge of the county.  The crime against compass points continues when you look at the map of Rushden South ward, at which point it becomes clear this is actually the <em>eastern half</em> of the town; the ward also takes in the small parish of Newton Bromswold.

The inaugural elections to North Northamptonshire council in 2021 borrowed the previous county council divisions, which is why the first election to Rushden South on the current boundaries happened all the way back in 2013.  All three elections to date have seen the Conservatives top the poll, and the Conservatives won all three seats here at the 2021 elections: shares of the vote were 49% for the Conservative slate, 22% for Labour and 15% for the Green Party.  Rushden is part of the Wellingborough parliamentary seat, which has been held since 2005 by Peter Bone of the Conservatives' awkward squad.

This is the third by-election to North Northamptonshire council since its creation, and the two previous polls both saw Conservative losses: the Oundle by-election in February 2022 was gained by the Lib Dems, while Labour gained a seat in Northall ward in Kettering last month.  Those were both more marginal wards than this one, but the Conservatives do still need to put the work in to hold this seat.

Whoever wins here will be taking over the seat previously held by the late Conservative councillor David Jenney.  Described as a political heavyweight, Jenney had started his political career in 2007 by being elected to East Northamptonshire council and Rushden town council; he served as mayor of Rushden in 2013-14.  Away from the council he was a chartered surveyor.  Jenney passed away suddenly on Boxing Day last year.

Defending for the Conservatives is Melanie Coleman, a Rushden town councillor who runs a local group of performers with learning disabilities called "It's My Life".  If you want to vote for her, it might be now or never.  Labour have selected Chris Ashton, who was locally-educated and is a member of the Rushden air cadets.  The Green candidate is Will Morris, who contested Irchester ward two years ago.  Also standing are Cassandra Avery for the Liberal Democrats and Dave Merlane for the Breakthrough Party, a left-wing group which is yet to live up to its name in an election.

<h2>Castle Baynard; and<br>
Cripplegate</h2>

City of London Corporation; caused respectively by the resignation of Common Councilman Martha Grekos and the election of Susan Pearson as Alderman.

We now have two polls to cover in that Quaint British Tradition of local government, the square mile of the ancient City of London.  The City of London Corporation is the UK's oldest local government unit and has seen very little reform since mediaeval times.  Its wards are little changed from those of centuries ago, and the names of Castle Baynard and Cripplegate both recall mediaeval structures which disappeared long ago.

The City is the only local government body which still retains Aldermen: there are 25 Aldermen, one for each ward, who outrank the 100 Common Councilmen.  You can't be an Alderman and a Common Councilman at the same time, so when a Common Councilman gets elected to the Aldermanic bench a by-election follows.  Which is how we come to Cripplegate ward, which Andrew's Previews last covered in September.  This is one of the City's four residential wards, based on the eastern half of the Barbican estate plus the Golden Lane estate: high-rise living from the postwar decades.  The ward's Alderman, David Graves, stood down last year, and the election to replace him in September 2022 went very easily to Common Councilman Susan Pearson.  This by-election is to replace Pearson's seat on the Common Council.

We also have to consider Castle Baynard ward, which has a couple of hundred people living there but is one of the City's many business-dominated wards: on the current boundaries, here can be found St Paul's Cathedral, Blackfriars station and Fleet Street.  The latter was once the home of the UK's newspaper industry, but no more - all the journalists have now relocated away from the Street of Shame.

City of London elections are normally fought on a non-partisan basis: that doesn't mean that there aren't party members on the council, but they don't stand for election as such.  However, Labour do stand a few candidates in City elections.  The current Court of Common Council was elected in March 2022, and Labour won five of the 100 seats up for election; three of those candidates were elected in Cripplegate ward.  The new Alderman Susan Pearson topped the poll in Cripplegate ward last year; second place went to the lead Labour candidate, Natasha Lloyd-Owen.

Cripplegate ward elects eight Common Councilmen, as does Castle Baynard ward.  Lloyd-Owen had previously been elected as a Common Councilman (the City uses this as a non-binary term) in an October 2018 by-election for Castle Baynard ward, coming through the middle of a freak vote split between seven independent candidates to win with just 28% of the vote.  This wasn't a sustainable position for Labour, and they didn't stand a candidate in 2022.  Instead the other seven incumbent councillors banded together and registered with the Electoral Commission as a political party, the Castle Baynard Independents Party.  This slate of eight was opposed by just one candidate: independent Martha Grekos, a City lawyer who topped the poll and was elected in first place.  Grekos has now resigned from the City Corporation after just under a year in office, with her resignation statement implying that the other councillors for the ward had undermined her.

Both by-elections have an entirely non-party lineup.  In Castle Baynard the candidate to beat may well be lawyer Michael Hudson, who represented the ward from 2013 until last year when he lost his seat to Grekos.  The other three candidates also stood for election to the Common Council last year without success: in March long-serving Common Councilman Kevin Everett finished in fourth and last place and lost his seat in Candlewick ward (based on King William Street), in July serial entrepreneur Edward Goodchild tied for third place in the election for Alderman for Walbrook ward, and in November Scott Longman finished last, with three votes to his name, in a by-election for Bridge and Bridge Without ward.

The Cripplegate by-election should have a very different vibe thanks to the ward's large residential electorate.  And it's not just the same old names either, because we have three first-time candidates standing.  Dawn Frampton lives on the Golden Lane Estate and is running very much on a localist ticket.  The other two candidates are based in the Barbican: Lionel Meyringer is an illustrator of children's books, while Angus Myline is a law student.
