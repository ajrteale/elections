Two by-elections on 17th August 2023:

<h2>Ayresome</h2>

Middlesbrough council, North Yorkshire; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Antony High.

Andrew's Previews has been stuck in southern parts of England for the first half of August, so it's good to be back in the north for our first by-election today.  We've come to a ward located firmly in the Teesside conurbation, on the Yorkshire side of the river Tees.

The name of Ayresome comes from Old English words meaning "river houses".  This ward is rather a long way from the river now, but that wasn't always the case.  The Tees originally took a very meandering course between Stockton and Middlesbrough, before a series of improvement works in the early nineteenth century resulted in the relatively straight channel we have now.  In particular the Mandale Cut, completed in 1810, shortened the length of the river by over two miles by removing a large southern meander.  Some of the river's pre-1810 course here is still in water, as the Old River Tees, and this stream is still the western boundary of Middlesbrough.

But today Middlesbrough's housing is separated from the old and new courses of river by the main arterial roads into Teesside.  The A19 from the north and south and the A66 from the west into the town centre meet here, in an impressive tangle of free-flowing sliproads.  This junction cuts off the Teesside Leisure Park, a cinema and leisure complex, from the rest of Middlesbrough; the Leisure Park is under Middlesbrough's juridsiction, but the only road onto the site comes from Stockton-on-Tees.

There is, however, a pedestrian footbridge over the A19 which connects the Leisure Park to Ayresome.  This ward covers housing on the western edge of Middlesbrough to the west of Acklam Road, including the Whinney Banks area.  Not included are Ayresome Street, Ayresome Gardens, Ayresome Primary School or the site of the former Middlesbrough FC stadium at Ayresome Park, all of which are currently in either Newport ward or Park ward.  Much of the housing here was originally built by the council in the inter-war years, and 23% of Ayresome ward's houses are still socially rented.  The population here is young, with Ayresome ward making the top 10 wards in north-east England for the under-16 and 16-17 age brackets.

Ayresome is one of the wards which seems to have a season ticket to this column.  It was one of the wards covered in the very first edition of what became Andrew's Previews, a post made to a political web forum in advance of five local by-elections which took place on 7th September 2010.  I described this ward then in these words:

<blockquote>
AYRESOME, Middlesbrough; caused by the resignation of a Labour councillor (who had, however, been elected as an Independent).  <a href="http://www.andrewteale.me.uk/r79#ward1638">2007 result here</a>.  The name "Ayresome" conjures up images of Middlesbrough FC's old ground at Ayresome Park; put those away, Ayresome Park was in Linthorpe ward.  This is a fairly typical working-class Middlesbrough ward on the western edge of the town, hard up against the A19 and A66 dual carriageways.
</blockquote>

I'd like to think my writing style has improved over the thirteen years since then, although you can judge that for yourself.  The 2010 by-election returned an independent councillor, William Hawthorne, who was re-elected in 2011 but lost his seat in 2015 when (on revised boundaries) Labour won both seats in the ward easily.  Long-serving Labour councillor Bernard Taylor died in 2017, so six summers ago we were back in Ayresome (<em>Andrew's Previews 2017</em>, page 185) for a July by-election which Labour held comfortably.  However, the by-election winner Vic Walkington lost his seat in 2019 to independent candidate Antony High, who lived up to his name by topoing the poll.  That left the two seats in Ayresome ward split between High and Labour.

This Labour versus independent battle is very typical of local elections in Middlesbrough, where the Conservatives are weak and independent candidates normally take the battle to Labour.  It helps the independent cause that Middlesbrough is one of those councils that has an elected mayor, a position which hasn't really delivered much political stability in recent years.  The first elected mayor of Middlesbrough was former policeman Ray "Robocop" Mallon, who won three terms of office as an independent candidate with overwhelming majorities; but the three elections since his retirement in 2015 have returned three different mayors, with independent Andy Preston winning very easily in 2019 but losing to Labour very narrowly in 2015 and 2023.

Ex-Mayor Preston hit the headlines again this month after the Crown Prosecution Service brought charges that he had failed to disclose financial interests during his mayoral term, before dropping those charges a week later after reviewing additional evidence.  Following the withdrawal of those charges Sir Simon Clarke, the Conservative MP for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland who was local government secretary for the five minutes of the Truss premiership, went so far as to write to his sucessor Michael Gove to call for May's mayoral election to be rerun.  One hopes that this is one of those letters which get written for the sake of being reported on rather than actioned: the Election Court doesn't work like that, Gove is no fool, and the Tories finished fourth and last in the Middlesbrough mayoral election in May.  Ayresome ward is not part of Clarke's constituency: it's within the Middlesbrough parliamentary seat which has been represented since a 2012 by-election by former Labour frontbencher Andy McDonald, and from the next general election it will be included in the successor seat of Middlesbrough and Thornaby East.

Outgoing Ayresome ward councillor Antony High actually served in Preston's cabinet, as deputy mayor with the children's services portfolio.  High stood against McDonald as an independent candidate for Middlesbrough in the December 2019 general election, finishing in a very creditable third place with 13% of the vote.  But he then resigned from Preston's cabinet in May 2021, with his resignation letter accusing the then mayor of "consistent poor conduct and behaviour".  High then joined Labour; he didn't get the Labour nomination for the 2023 Middlesbrough mayoral election, but he was successfully re-elected at the top of the Labour slate in May for a second term as councillor for Ayresome ward.  Shares of the vote were 47% for Labour, 27% for an independent candidate and 18% for the Conservatives.

Newly re-elected councillor Antony High then resigned from Middlesbrough a month later, indicating that his work circumstances had changed on the day after the election.  He was part of the majority Labour group on the council, which stands at 24 Labour councillors plus this vacancy against 15 independents, 4 Conservatives and 2 Lib Dems.

Defending this seat for Labour is Mick Thompson, a former Middlesbrough councillor who was the party's losing mayoral candidate in 2019; he is a charity worker associated with UNISON, and was last profiled by this column in September 2021 as the defending Labour candidate who finished in third place in a by-election for Ladgate ward (<em>Andrew's Previews 2021</em>, page 376).  In May Thompson contested Berwick Hills and Pallister, the ward he represented from 2013 to 2019.  This time the independent vote will be split between two candidates.  Jon Rathmell was an independent councillor for the middle-class Nunthorpe ward from 2015 to 2023, serving as leader of the Middlesbrough Independent Councillors Association (one of the council's two main independent groups in the period 2019-23) and getting himself into the Councillors Behaving Badly file: in 2021 Rathmell pleaded guilty to misconduct in public office over forged documents relating to a 2018 firework display which he had organised, and he was given a two-year conditional discharge.  The other independent candidate is Jackie Young, who runs the Community Champions Middlesbrough Facebook group; she fought Central ward in May, but lives here.  The Conservatives have selected Sajid Hussain, who fought Hemlington ward (where he lives) in May.  Also standing are Claire Brent for the Lib Dems and Matthew Harris for the Green Party.

<h2>Marshalswick East and Jersey Farm</h2>

St Albans council, Hertfordshire; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Elissa Dacosta-Waldman.

Our other by-election today couldn't be more different.  From a deprived urban area we've come to the affluent suburbia of Marshalswick and Jersey Farm.  This housing lies on the north-eastern edge of the built-up area of St Albans, which has outgrown its traditional boundary; this ward lies entirely within the parish of Sandridge.  The 1970s estate of Jersey Farm marks the end of the housing, with Marshalswick further in.

St Albans as a whole is very much with the orbit of London, and even places like Marshalswick and Jersey Farm which are some way from the city's railway stations and transport links have 50% of the workforce in managerial or professional jobs.  Which perhaps gives some indication as to why the Liberal Democrats have comprehensively taken over local elections in this area.  St Albans was one of the few parliamentary seats gained by the Lib Dems in 2019, and the party now has a massive majority on the council: 47 seats plus this vacancy against four Conservatives, three Greens and an independent.

The current ward boundaries date from 2022 and fused together two areas with differing political traditions.  The former Marshalswick North ward is part of the St Albans parliamentary seat and has been a Lib Dem stronghold for a very long time; in the last 21 years it only failed to vote Lib Dem once, in 2015 when the Conservatives won.  Jersey Farm, on the other hand, was until 2022 part of the more rural Sandridge ward, which is currently in the Hitchin and Harpenden constituency represented by Conservative backbencher Bim Afolami; the forthcoming parliamentary boundary changes will split that seat into two new ones, with Jersey Farm transferring to a brand-new constituency called Harpenden and Berkhamsted.  Sandridge ward was safely Conservative until the Lib Dem landslide of 2022.  The Lib Dems represent the whole of this area on Hertfordshire county council, as part of Colney Heath and Marshalswick division.

Mind, the Lib Dems haven't had it all their own way in St Albans recently.  Two months ago they lost a by-election in the city-centre St Peters ward to the Green Party.  And the party have another seat to defend straight away in this by-election which arises from the resignation of Elissa Dacosta-Waldman, who away from the council is a barrister specialising in family and matrimonial law.  Dacosta-Waldman was first elected to the council in the 2022 all-up elections where she finished in second place, meaning that her successor will inherit a short term ending in 2024.  The Lib Dems held Marshalswick East and Jersey Farm ward in May with a 50-34 lead over the Conservatives.

Defending for the Lib Dems is Raihaanah Ahmed, who does a lot of community work in the city; she is fighting her first election campaign.  The Conservatives have reselected Frances Leonard, who fought this ward in May; she represented Jersey Farm as a councillor for Sandridge ward from 2007 to 2022, and earlier this year she was named as an Honorary Alderman of St Albans in recognition of her public service.  Also standing are James Lomas for the Greens, Nick Pullinger for Labour and independent candidate Samuel Posner.
