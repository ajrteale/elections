</p><p>
Spring has well and truly sprung.  The trees are full of the new season's blossom.  The roads are full of the last season's potholes.  And the bins are full of leaflets, straining the backs of the binmen who are the first step in turning this season's election publicity into next season's recycled paper.
</p><p>
A huge amount of what you see in the picture above has been influenced by the local council.  The lamppost in the background at the right, partly hidden behind a tree, was designed to look good given its location in a town centre.  The lamppost in the foreground has a speed limit sign attached to it; its counterpart on the other side on the post reads "20", instructing drivers to keep their speed down through a residential area - the council signed that off.  The bookmakers on the left edge of the picture went through the council planning process when it opened, many years ago.  The health centre and library is a new building which opened just over two months ago, built, paid for and operated out of my council tax.  If an election leaflet I've received is anything to go by, it's already Bolton's busiest branch library.  And the unfixed potholes in the road are an illustration of the parlous state of council finances.
</p><p>
It's the council who get to have the final say on important matters like how often the bins are emptied, how often the roads are resurfaced, and how much their employees get paid for doing that.  It's the council who get to have the final say on important matters like where shops can be opened, how our libraries are run, where our children's schools are located, where new housing is to be built, whether new housing is to be built.  It's the council that registers our hatchings, matchings and dispatchings, and that supports its more vulnerable residents in between through one of the largest parts of the local government budget - social services.  To do all this our 400 or so local councils, between them, employ around two million people - a figure that has reduced by a third since 2010 as central government, who stump up the bill for much of this, have slowly turned the financial thumbscrews.
</p><p>
In the UK, we ensure that the public have oversight of all this through regular local government elections.  Every year, on the first Thursday in May, new councillors are elected while old councillors retire.  In 2022 the UK's local elections will most likely be the biggest electoral event of the year.  Let's have a look at what we might expect from them.
</p><p>
<h2>Setting the scene</h2>
</p><p>
Local elections relate to local issues, but they take place against the backdrop of the national political scene.  A rising tide lifts all boats, whereas a falling tide can leave some vessels high and dry.  Many councillors find that their jobs are won and lost based on what's happening outside their district.
</p><p>
</p><p>
Like most local election years in the UK (with the exception of 2021), there is patchy coverage this year with some districts going to the polls while others don't.  On the bill for May 2022 we have all the councillors up for election in Scotland, Wales and Greater London, together with elections for the whole of North Yorkshire and Somerset county councils, and for two brand-new councils in Cumbria.  There is a general election to the Northern Ireland Assembly.  In the rest of England only those councils in England which return a third or a half of their councillors at each election will be going to the polls; these are generally the most urban districts and include nearly of all of England's metropolitan areas.  If you live in rural England, chances are that you'll be sitting this year's elections out.
</p><p>
This urban bias translates into a Labour-voting bias.  Most of the seats up this year were last contested in 2018, and the <a href="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/leap/">Local Elections Archive Project database</a> shows that that year (in England only) 41.2% of the votes were cast for Labour, 31.8% for the Conservatives, 14.0% for the Liberal Democrats, 6.7% for the Green Party, 2.1% for independent candidates, 1.3% for UKIP and the remaining 2.9% for localists and other parties.  In terms of council seats, Labour won 2,359, the Conservatives 1,338, the Liberal Democrats 540, the Greens 39, independents 61, UKIP 3 and localists and the rest won 84.
</p><p>
To allow consistent comparisons to be made across local elections from year to year, the BBC make an estimate of how the vote would have gone across the whole country based on vote changes in a representative sample of wards.  Their Projected National Share for the 2018 local elections put the Conservatives and Labour level on 35% each and the Lib Dems on 16%.  We can see from the differences between these and the figures above that the wards holding elections tend to be stronger for Labour, and weaker for the Conservatives and the Lib Dems, than the GB average.
</p><p>
There have been only two sets of local elections since, as a result of the COVID-enforced cancellation of the 2020 polls.  The May 2019 elections came at a time of great weakness for both the Conservative and Labour parties at the height of the Brexit debates, and the BBC's projected shares put the Conservatives and Labour on just 28% each with the Lib Dems on 19%.  By contrast, the May 2021 polls came with the Conservatives riding high in the national polls on the back of the COVID vaccination programme, and the local elections reflected this; the projected shares came out at 36% for the Conservatives, 29% for Labour and 17% for the Liberal Democrats.  Much has happened since May 2021, and the national polling is showing a swing to the Labour party who have had a consistent opinion poll lead for some months.
</p><p>
The timeline means that it may be difficult for the Labour party to turn that lead into significant gains this time.  The Labour party are defending over half of the seats up for election this year, and a large proportion of this set of elections is Greater London where Labour performed particularly well at the last local elections in 2018.  Additionally, the big Conservative lead in the 2021 local elections turned into major gains in the rotational councils, and with those seats now in the bank for the Conservatives until 2024 the opposition parties will have to do just as well, in the other direction, to make significant headway.
</p><p>
You'll see this theme developing in the detailed previews which now follow.  Links given are to results from the Local Elections Archive Project, while the maps are from 2018 or (if different) the year when these seats were last contested.  Without further ado, let's get out into the country:

<h2 id="ne">North East</h2>
</p><p>
In the North East region all councils are holding ordinary elections except Northumberland and Durham, with all seats up for election in Darlington, Middlesbrough, Redcar and Cleveland, and Stockton-on-Tees and one-third of the council up in Hartlepool and the five Tyne and Wear boroughs.
</p><p>
<img alt="Sunderland, 2019" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/sunderland19s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
As usual, we'll commence with the city of <b>Sunderland</b> which takes pride in normally being the first district to declare its results.  Last year I had speculated that we had reached the point where the Labour majority in the city could be in danger; but that moment now appears to have passed after the party stopped the rot at the 2022 elections.  Sunderland now has 43 Labour councillors, 15 Conservatives, 14 Lib Dems, one Reform UK and two independents.  This year Labour are only defending twelve seats plus a by-election gain from UKIP, and a repeat of last year's results would give three Labour gains.  The other four Tyne and Wear councils have impregnable Labour majorities.
</p><p>
<img alt="Hartlepool, 2021" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/hartlepool21s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
The hung <b>Hartlepool</b> council is currently very evenly-balanced, with 13 Conservative, 13 Labour and 10 independent or localist councillors.  An independent/Conservative coalition is in control.  The whole council was up for election in 2021 on new ward boundaries, and that election produced a curiously skewed set of retiring councillors: this year five of the independents/localists are up for re-election, against four Conservatives and just three Labour.  Last year Labour successfully defended seven seats and they have since picked up an independent seat in a by-election; a repeat of last year's results would see Labour gain four seats and become the largest party on the council, although that would not be enough for a majority.  A Labour majority in Hartlepool would probably have to wait for 2024, when most of the Conservative group will need to seek re-election.
</p><p>
<img alt="Darlington, 2019" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/darlington19s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Labour lost their majority on <b>Darlington</b> council in 2019 and a Conservative/independent coalition is running the town.  Last time the Conservatives won 22 seats here against 20 Labour, 3 independents, 3 Lib Dems and 2 Greens; the Conservatives gained a seat from Labour at a May 2021 by-election.  The Conservatives had a large lead in votes here four years ago, but this is one district where England's first-past-the-post system works against them: Darlington's Labour vote is concentrated in the town wards, which tend to have lower turnouts, while the Conservatives pile up large majorities in the rural fringe wards.
</p><p>
<img alt="Stockton-on-Tees, 2019" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/stockton19s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
New ward boundaries are coming in for <b>Stockton-on-Tees</b>, which Labour run as a minority.  The 2019 elections here returned 24 Labour councillors, 14 Conservatives, 7 Thornaby localists, 6 independent councillors, 3 Ingleby Barwick localists and two Lib Dems; the Conservatives have since gained two seats in by-elections, one from an independent and the other from the Lib Dems.
</p><p>
<img alt="Middlesbrough, 2019" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/middlesbrough19s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Local government in the two Tees Valley towns wholly on the Yorkshire side of the river is rather difficult to follow.  <b>Middlesbrough</b> has an elected mayoralty, which is held by independent mayor Andy Preston: he gained the position from Labour in 2019 by the thumping margin of 59-23.  The associated council is closely divided between independent and Labour councillors on paper, but in practice the independent councillors are themselves divided into two factions who will bicker with just about anybody, including Mayor Preston.
</p><p>
Andy Preston is seeking re-election for a second term.  He faces a field of three opposition candidates, led by Labour's Chris Cooke who is a serving councillor for the town's Newport ward and runs the local branch of a mental health charity.  Another Middlesbrough councillor on the ballot is independent Jon Rathmell, who represents Nunthorpe ward and was leader of one of the council's independent factions, the "Middlesbrough Independent Councillors Association", until he got into the Councillors Behaving Badly file: in 2021 Rathmell pleaded guilty to misconduct in public office over forged documents relating to a 2018 firework display which he had organised, and was given a two-year conditional discharge.  Completing the mayoral ballot is John Cooper for the Conservatives, who appeared in this column last year when he contested the Berwick Hills and Pallister by-election to Middlesbrough council.
</p><p>
<img alt="Redcar/Cleveland, 2019" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/redcar-cleveland19s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
<b>Redcar and Cleveland</b> is run by a coalition of independent and Lib Dem councillors after the 2019 elections returned an extremely balanced council: 15 Labour, 14 independents, 13 Lib Dems, 11 Conservatives, 3 Eston localilsts, 2 UKIP and 1 East Cleveland localist.  On paper by-election results here have been very positive for the Conservatives; in practice their group has split and there are only six Tory councillors left.
</p><p>
There is also one local by-election to Durham council, where the Conservatives are defending <em>Chester-le-Street East</em>.  This division name does pretty much what it says on the tin, taking in the eastern quarter of the town: it is overlooked by Lumley Castle on the far side of the River Wear.  Here can be found the Riverside cricket ground, home of Durham county cricket club and a regular venue for England one-day international and T20 matches: Test matches have previously been played here, but the Riverside was taken off the Test rota in 2016 as a result of financial sanctions on Durham.
</p><p>
This is Chester-le-Street's most middle-class ward and is one of the strongest Conservative wards in the Durham council area: in 2017, when just five of Durham's wards voted Conservative, Chester-le-Street East was one of them.  The late Conservative councillor Beatrice "Beaty" Bainbridge, who was the Durham council chair when she passed away earlier this year, was a political veteran although her continuous service only dated from 2017; in 2021 she polled 42% of the vote against 31% for Labour and 23% for the Greens.  Her widower, former police officer Allan Bainbridge, is the defending Conservative candidate; Labour have selected Julie Scurfield, who was appointed BEM in 2020 for her work as a girls' football coach, while the Greens have withdrawn to leave the Lib Dem's Russell Haswell to complete the ballot paper.
</p><p>
<h2 id="nw">North West</h2>
</p><p>
For our tour of the north-west let's start in Greater Manchester, where the Local Government Boundary Commission have been hard at work.  One-third of the council is up for election in Bury, Manchester, Rochdale and Salford as usual, but new boundaries are being introduced this year in Trafford, Stockport, Tameside, Oldham, Wigan and the Greatest Town in the Known Universe.
</p><p>
<img alt="Bolton, 2019" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/bolton19s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
<b>Bolton</b> is the only metropolitan borough in the north of England which is run by the Conservatives.  They do not have a majority on the council: the latest composition, following a by-election gain for the Conservatives in Rumworth last year, is 25 Conservative councillors, 19 Labour, 5 Lib Dems and 11 independents and localists.  One of the localist groups, Farnworth and Kearsley First, managed to persuade the LGBCE to allocate nine seats to Farnworth and Kearsley when they only have enough electors to justify eight seats; this might, however, have come too late to save FKF who drew a blank last year after Labour performed well in Farnworth.  In fact, the localists overall had a poor election here in 2022, winning only Kearsley ward.  The Rumworth by-election gain for the Conservatives last year probably does not herald a Conservative majority in Bolton; strongly-Muslim wards like Rumworth can do weird things depending what is happening in the local mosques.  Labour target areas will include both Horwich wards, and Hulton ward where there is a huge local planning controversy and where the Conservatives have had to disown one of their candidates for racist stuff on social media; but the path to a Labour majority here is a long one.
</p><p>
New boundaries came in last year for neighbouring <b>Bury</b>, where Labour increased their majority: there are currently 28 Labour councillors, 11 Conservatives, 8 Radcliffe localists, 3 independents and a Lib Dem.  Although there are a number of marginal wards here, the small Labour majority in Bury doesn't look in serious danger.
</p><p>
<img alt="Oldham, 2019" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/oldham19s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
In <b>Oldham</b>, Labour have been going backwards in recent years and have a lot of work to do to secure their majority.  There are currently 35 Labour councillors against 9 Conservatives, 9 Lib Dems, 5 Failsworth localists and two independents.  New boundaries come in here.
</p><p>
<img alt="Stockport, 2019" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/stockport19s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
There are also ward boundary changes in the only Greater Manchester borough which has never had a Labour majority.  That's <b>Stockport</b>, which includes some strongly middle-class suburbs on the edge of Greater Manchester such as Cheadle, Bramhall and Marple - the Conservative-held parliamentary seats of Cheadle and Hazel Grove cover this area.  However, this doesn't mean that Stockport council has a lot of Conservatives: in fact, the Stockport Tories will be wiped out at this election if they can't improve on their 2022 showing.  Instead, the beneficiaries of this demographic locally are the Liberal Democrats, who run Stockport council as a minority with 28 councillors; in opposition are 22 Labour, 4 Conservatives, 3 Heald Green localists, 3 independents and 2 Greens.  The Labour councillors are well dug-in and the Lib Dems may find it hard to get the gains they need for a council majority.
</p><p>
<img alt="Ches E, 2019" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/cheshire-e19s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Just outside the Stockport council boundary is Handforth of blessed memory, which is part of the large <b>Cheshire East</b> district which sprawls from Knutsford, Wilmslow and Macclesfield to Congleton, Crewe, Nantwich and the Shropshire border.  Following an appalling Conservative performance here in 2019, Cheshire East is run by a coalition of Labour, independent and localist councillors which, until his death last year, included Barry Burkhill from <em>that</em> video.  Burkhill's seat is vacant going into these elections.
</p><p>
<img alt="CWAC, 2019" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/cheshire-w-chester19s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
<b>Cheshire West and Chester</b> council has had a precarious Labour minority administration for eight years now: the 2019 elections here returned 35 Labour councillors, 28 Conservatives, four independents, two Lib Dems and a Green councillor, giving Labour half of the 70 seats.  The recent parliamentary by-election in the City of Chester suggests that a Conservative comeback here is probably not on the cards.  Britain Elects needs to declare an interest here, as our genial host Ben Walker is on the defending Labour slate for Chester City and the Garden Quarter ward.
</p><p>
<img alt="Wirral, 2019" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/wirral19s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Moving into Merseyside, <b>Wirral</b> council is moving to whole-council elections this year of its own volition.  The Land of the Plastic Scouser currently has a minority Labour administration with 26 Labour councillors, 23 Conservatives, 9 Greens, 6 Lib Dems, an independent and one vacant seat.  Labour have been going backwards on the Wirral in recent years, losing seats to the Greens in Birkenhead and Bebington and to the Conservatives in marginal wards like Pensby and Thingwall.  Expect a continued hung council here.
</p><p>
<img alt="Liverpool, 2019" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/liverpool19s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Travelling through the Mersey Tunnels we come to the city of <b>Liverpool</b>, which is moving to whole-council elections this year by government diktat; this is accompanied by a boundary review which has left the city's ward map completely unrecognisable from the above, and by the abolition of the city's Labour-held elected mayoralty.  That will transfer power back to Liverpool council, which currently has a large Labour majority with 57 councillors against 12 independent councillors, 11 Lib Dems, 4 Greens and 4 continuing Liberals.  Most of the independent councillors are Labour defectors: the Liverpool Labour group is clearly not a happy place to be right now, and the party has put in a number of indifferent by-election performances in wards in the north of the city over the last two years.  That hasn't actually cost them any seats, but those are safe wards and one of them was nearly lost to the Lib Dems.
</p><p>
There are no elections this year in St Helens or Warrington.  The Labour majorities in the metropolitan boroughs I haven't mentioned so far - Rochdale, Tameside, Manchester, Trafford, Salford, Wigan, Knowsley and Sefton - are impregnable.  Halton is not a metropolitan borough but also falls into the safe-Labour category.
</p><p>
<img alt="W Lancs, 2019" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/w-lancs19s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
In the Lancashire county council area, there is an all-out election this year in <b>West Lancashire</b> to introduce new ward boundaries.  This is a hung council at present, with a minority Labour administration of 25 councillors facing an opposition of 20 Conservatives, 7 "Our West Lancashire" localists and 2 independents.  The boundary changes here are radical, but the result of the recent West Lancashire parliamentary by-election suggests that the local Labour party is in good shape right now.  However, we may need to wait a little while for this council to be settled: the poll for the three seats in the new Rural South ward has had to be postponed after one of the candidates died before nominations closed.
</p><p>
<img alt="S Ribble, 2019" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/s-ribble19s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
<b>South Ribble</b> council is also run by a Labour minority, with 23 Labour councillors, 21 Conservatives, 5 Lib Dems and one vacant seat.  This district is based on Leyland and Preston suburbs to the south of the Ribble, including Penwortham (which is the Lib Dem area) and Bamber Bridge.  Labour should reasonably expect to gain an overall majority here.
</p><p>
<img alt="Hyndburn, 2019" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/hyndburn19s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Moving into East Lancashire, we need to have a word about <b>Hyndburn</b>.  Based on its election results over the last three years, this should have a Labour majority already: in 2019 Labour won nine wards to the Conservatives' three, 2021 was a 6-6 draw, and in 2022 Labour won 6 wards while the Conservatives won 5 and gained a by-election off Labour.  That would total up to 20 Labour and 15 Conservative councillors, but the Labour group has comprehensively split: going into these elections there are now 15 Conservative councillors, 13 Labour, 2 Greens and 5 independents.  Those five include the former Labour leader of the council Miles Parkinson, who is still the council leader but now in a coalition with the Conservative group.  He is seeking re-election this year as an independent candidate in Altham ward, which was a Conservative gain when it last came up for election in 2021.  Overall the Conservatives, Labour and independent councillors are defending four seats each this year: a repeat of the most recent results in the wards up for election would give an 18-18 tie between the Conservatives and Labour, with the two Greens and an ex-Labour independent holding the balance of power.

<img alt="Burrnley, 2019" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/burnley19s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Further up the M65 we come to <b>Burrnley</b>, which is a hung council: there is currently a coalition of 19 Labour and 8 Lib Dem councillors against 6 Conservatives, 6 Greens, 4 Burrnley and Padiham localists, an independent and a vacant seat.  The 2019 map shows a UKIP seat here in Hapton with Park ward: that councillor is now in the Conservative group which has essentially been taken over by the former Burrnley UKIP branch.  If the 2022 results are repeated then the ruling coalition would increase its majority, with Labour gaining Rosegrove with Lowerhouse ward from the Burrnley and Padiham localists.
</p><p>
In <b>Pendle</b>, as happened last year, the Conservatives have mislaid their majority just before the council elections as a result of a Conservative seat going vacant: for the second year in a row, there will be two seats up for election in Vivary Bridge ward this year.  Effectively the Conservatives are defending a majority of one, as there are 16 Conservative councillors plus the vacant seat against 10 Labour, 5 Lib Dems and an ex-Labour independent.  This year the Conservatives are defending the two ex-Yorkshire West Craven wards, which both voted Lib Dem last year, and Marsden and Southfield ward in Nelson which voted Labour last year.  The Tories have a chance of gaining Waterside and Horsfield ward in Colne from the Lib Dems, but unless they can do significantly better than 12 months ago then Pendle is going to No Overall Control.

</p><p>
Over the hills to the south, Labour have a small majority in the volatile <b>Rossendale</b> district: there are currently 19 Labour councillors, 11 Conservatives, 3 independents, 2 councillors from "Community First" which is a localist group for Whitworth, and a Green.  Labour are only defending five seats this year and look well-placed to keep control, but the Conservatives performed well in two by-elections here during the Truss era and Rossendale is a council where small vote swings can translate into big seat changes.

Elsewhere in Lancashire, there are secure Labour majorities in Blackburn with Darwen, Chorley and Preston.  The Conservatives have large majorities in the tiny Ribble Valley district (tiny in population terms; it's a far-flung area based on Clitheroe), the Fylde district (based on Lytham St Annes) and the Wyre district (based on Fleetwood, Poulton-le-Fylde and Garstang).

<img alt="Blackpool, 2019" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/blackpool19s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
<b>Blackpool</b> is another council where Labour has mislaid its majority over the last council term.  In 2019 Labour won 23 seats in Blackpool against 15 Conservatives and 4 independents; the latest composition gives 20 Labour, 13 Conservatives and 9 independents.  That includes a recent by-election gain in Greenlands ward for Labour, who should probably recover their majority here.
</p><p>
<img alt="Lancaster, 2019" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/lancaster19s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Last but not least in the North West is the city of <b>Lancaster</b>, whose council takes in Morecambe, Carnforth and a large rural hinterland.  Lancaster council is permanently hung and has been even more volatile than usual in the last term.  The 2019 elections returned 21 Labour councillors, 14 Morecambe Bay Independents, 12 Conservatives, 10 Greens and 3 Lib Dems.  Following splits in both the Labour and Morecambe Bay Independent groups, there is now a Green council leader; her cabinet includes members of most of the council's political groups, but not the Conservatives and Lib Dems.  By-elections in this term (and there have been a lot of them) have been all over the place; add in the effect of new ward boundaries, and it would be a brave person who would try and predict this one.
</p><p>
Local government reorganisation in Cumbria means that only town and parish councils are up for election there this year; this includes the inaugural election for the new Barrow town council, which covers nearly all of the former Barrow-in-Furness district and will become one of the largest parishes in England by population.  Also in Barrow is our first by-election to the new Cumbrian local government structure, for the ward of <em>Old Barrow and Hindpool</em> which is part of the new Westmorland and Furness council.  This is Barrow's town-centre ward, taking in everything south-west of the railway line including the docklands of Barrow Island, where BAE Systems are manufacturing the next generation of the Royal Navy's nuclear submarines; reflecting all this industry, Old Barrow and Hindpool is in the top 15 wards in England and Wales for adults with apprenticeship qualifications and in the top 80 for those working in semi-routine occupations.  Two-thirds of the ward's households are terraced houses, which is in the top 40 wards in England and Wales.
</p><p>
Westmorland and Furness council has a Liberal Democrat majority, but the Lib Dems have traditially had little or no organisation in Barrow-in-Furness.  Until its abolition last month Barrow council had had a Labour majority since 2011, and the late Ann Thomson - who had been first elected in 1990 - was that council's leader from 2019 until her death a couple of months before the council's abolition.  Thomson was elected to Westmorland and Furness in 2022 on the Labour slate in Old Barrow and Hindpool ward, which Labour won with a 66-28 margin over the Conservatives; the task of defending that Labour majority falls to training and education worker Dave Cassidy, who is opposed by the Conservatives' Derek Gawne and the Lib Dems' Stephen Pickthall.

<img alt="Sheffield, 2019" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/sheffield19s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
In Yorkshire we have elections for seven of the nine metropolitan boroughs: the five in West Yorkshire plus Barnsley and Sheffield.  All of these have Labour majorities except for the city of <b>Sheffield</b>, which is hung: the latest composition in the home of snooker has 38 reds, 29 yellows, 14 Greens, 1 blue and a cue-ball - or independent councillor, who was elected as Labour.  The city's governance arrangements are complicated, but it's fair to say that all parties are involved in some way.  A repeat of the 2022 results would see Labour gain Crookes/Crosspool and East Ecclesfield wards from the Lib Dems, but that would still leave them well short of the 43 seats needed for a council majority.
</p><p>
<img alt="Kirklees, 2019" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/kirklees19s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
The most marginal council in West Yorkshire is <b>Kirklees</b>, which covers Huddersfield and Dewsbury along with a large number of smaller towns and villages.  Kirklees currently has a Labour majority of one: 35 Labour councillors against 18 Conservatives, 8 Lib Dems, 4 independents and 3 Greens..  The 2022 elections here were good for Labour, who stand to gain three seats if they are repeated: those wards would be Denby Dale (from the Conservatives), Dewsbury East (from an independent) and Golcar (in western Huddersfield, from the Lib Dems).
</p><p>
<img alt="Calderdale, 2019" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/calderdale19s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Also in the foothills of the Pennines is <b>Calderdale</b> council, whose largest town is Halifax but which also extends to Brighouse, Hebden Bridge and Todmorden.  This has a larger Labour majority at present, with 28 Labour councillors, 15 Conservatives, 6 Lib Dems, a Green and an independent.  A repeat of 2022 would see just one ward change hands, with the Greens gaining a second seat in Northowram and Shelf from the Conservatives who would confirm a by-election gain from an independent in Ryburn ward.
</p><p>
<img alt="Bradford, 2019" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/bradford19s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
The big cities of Bradford and Leeds both have comfortable Labour majorities with reasonably large oppositions, as a result of both cities including an extensive small-town and rural hinterland: Bradford city council includes Keighley and Ilkley, while the Leeds city limits run all the way up to Wetherby.  The par score for Labour in <b>Bradford</b> based on last year's results is also an increased majority, with gains from the Conservatives in Bingley and from the Lib Dems in Eccleshill offsetting a loss to the Greens in Tong ward.  Currently Bradford Labour stand at 52 seats out of 90.
</p><p>
<img alt="Leeds, 2019" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/leeds19s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
In <b>Leeds</b> the Labour majority is currently 56 out of 99.  A repeat of 2022 would see seats fly in all directions (including a gain for the continuing SDP in Middleton Park ward) but the net change would be an increase to 57 Labour councillors.  The other two Yorkshire metropolitan boroughs - Barnsley and Wakefield - have large Labour majorities.
</p><p>
<img alt="Hull, 2019" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/hull19s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
It's a rather different story in East Yorkshire.  Last year the Liberal Democrats gained overall control of the city of <b>Kingston upon Hull</b> from Labour, and their lead over Labour on the council is 29-27.  A  Labour fightback does not look on the cards in Hull unless they perform significantly better than in 2022, because if those results are repeated the Lib Dems would gain one further seat in Longhill and Bilton Grange ward.
</p><p>
<img alt="E Riding, 2019" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/e-riding19s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Hull council is completely surrounded on the landward side by the sprawling <b>East Riding</b> district, which returned a large Conservative majority in 2019: 49 seats against 8 independents, 8 Lib Dems and two seats for the Yorkshire Party.  Since then the Conservatives have lost four by-elections in the East Riding to the Lib Dems: two in Bridlington North, and one each in South Hunsley and Beverley Rural.  This might well be one to watch.
</p><p>
There are no elections this year in North Yorkshire, following the recent reorganisation, or in the metropolitan boroughs of Doncaster and Rotherham which will next go to the polls in 2025 and 2024 respectively.
</p><p>
<h2 id="em">East Midlands</h2>
</p><p>
<img alt="High Peak, 2019" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/high-peak19s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
With the north dealt with it's time to head into the Midlands, although we'll start with a council which probably should be part of the North West region.  <b>High Peak</b> council is based on towns like Glossop, New Mills and Buxton which are within the economic and cultural orbit of Manchester but are part of Derbyshire rather than Cheshire or Lancashire.  The 2019 elections here returned a hung council with 22 Labour councillors, 16 Conservatives, 3 Lib Dems and 2 Greens; last year the Conservatives gained a by-election from Labour in the Cote Heath ward of Buxton.  A minority Labour administration is in control; Labour did well here in the 2021 Derbyshire county council elections and have plenty of target wards for a council majority.
</p><p>
<img alt="Derbyshire Dales, 2019" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/derbys-dales19s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
High Peak is next to <b>Derbyshire Dales</b> district, which returned a Conservative majority of one in 2019 that has since disappeared due to a split in the group.  The Conservatives still run this council, but now have to rely on a coalition with independent councillors.
</p><p>
<img alt="S Derbyshire, 2019" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/s-derbys19s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
There has also been a Conservative split in <b>South Derbyshire</b>, which had quite a comfortable Conservative majority in 2019: 22 seats against 14 for Labour.  However, in this case the Conservative splinter group has installed a Labour minority administration.  The latest composition, after Labour took a by-election off the Conservatives last year, has Labour and the Consevatives tied on 16 seats each with four independents holding the balance of power.
</p><p>
<img alt="Derby, 2019" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/derby19s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
The city of <b>Derby</b> is all-up this year on new ward boundaries, and will not be going back to its previous thirds electoral cycle.  The latest composition for this hung council has 17 Conservatives, 16 Labour councillors, 7 Lib Dems, 5 Reform Derby councillors, 4 independents and two vacant seats.  Reform Derby are the former UKIP group here, and they are in an electoral alliance with Reform UK.
</p><p>
<img alt="Erewash, 2019" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2015/erewash15s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
To the east of Derby can be found the <b>Erewash</b> district, which is based on the towns of Ilkeston and Long Eaton on the Derbyshire side of the Erewash valley.  In 2019 this returned 27 Conservative councillors against 19 Labour and 1 Lib Dem.  This is a council which Labour will be looking to gain control of, and they will be pleased by gaining Long Eaton's county council seat from the Conservatives in a by-election last year.
</p><p>
<img alt="Amber Valley, 2019" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/amber-valley19s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Like Derby, the <b>Amber Valley</b> district is moving off the thirds electoral cycle this year.  2019 was a fairly poor year for the Amber Valley Conservatives, but they did very well here in 2021 and were still gaining council seats last year.  However, the current Conservative majority on the council is rather smaller than you would expect from those results, because a number of Conservative councillors have recently walked out to join Reform UK.  The latest composition gives 24 Tories against 10 Labour, 5 Reform UK (ex-Conservative), 3 Greens, 2 Belper localists (ex-Labour) and a "Socialist" (also ex-Labour).
</p><p>
<img alt="NE Derbys, 2019" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/ne-derbys19s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
<b>North East Derbyshire</b> will be a fascinating council to watch.  This former coalmining centre is increasingly turning into a favoured location for Sheffield commuters, and it returned a Conservative majority in 2019: 30 Conservatives, 18 Labour, 3 Lib Dems and 2 independents.  Four Conservative councillors have since gone independent, wiping out that majority.  By-election results here have been mixed.  This district surrounds the borough of Chesterfield, which has a secure Labour majority.
</p><p>
<img alt="Bolsover, 2019" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/bolsover19s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
We're now definitely into the ex-coalfield areas of Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire, which returned Conservative MPs with massive majorities in December 2019.  The defeat of Dennis Skinner in Bolsover was presaged by Labour losing control of <b>Bolsover</b> council in 2019: however, they didn't do quite as badly as the map above indicates, as the seat count ended up with 18 Labour, 16 independents, 2 Conservatives and a Lib Dem.  Labour have since recovered their council majority by gaining an independent seat in Pinxton ward at a by-election, and holding that gain at a second by-election.
</p><p>
<img alt="Bassetlaw, 2019" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/bassetlaw19s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
The strength of the Conservative win in <b>Bassetlaw</b> in December 2019 makes the council of that name quite unpredictable this year.  In fact the May 2019 Basetlaw elections were awful for the Conservatives, who went backwards on the council: Labour won 37 seats against 5 Conservatives, 5 independents and a Lib Dem.  The 2021 Derbyshire county elections here were fairly closely fought, and a recent by-election gain in the rural Sutton ward suggests that the Labour machine might not have seized up here yet.
</p><p>
<img alt="Mansfield, 2019" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/mansfield19s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Another bright spot for Labour on the coalfield in 2019 was <b>Mansfield</b>.  This has an elected mayorality which was held from 2002 to 2019 by the Mansfield Independents on small majorities; but in 2019 Labour's Andy Abrahams gained the mayoralty by just two votes, polling 7,930 votes to 7,928 for the incumbent Mansfield Independents mayor Kate Allsop.  That was after transfers, and Abrahams' lead on first preferences was a rather more comfortable 1,021 votes: this comes to just 29%, but under the new mayoral election rules that would have won his seat on a freak vote split against 25% for Allsop, 20% for another independent and 15% for the Conservatives.
</p><p>
The move to the first-past-the-post system for mayoral elections will clearly benefit Labour in Mansfield, as they have twice led mayoral elections here on first preferences before being overtaken on transfers.  Abrahams is looking for a second term as the Labour candidate.  The Mansfield Independents have selected Mick Barton, who represents Maun Valley ward on the council.  Another independent on the ballot is Julie Tasker-Love-Birks, a complimentary therapist.  Standing for the Conservatives is Andre Camilleri, who is a county councillor for Mansfield South - he beat Andy Abrahams there in 2021, and will be hoping to do so again on a boroughwide stage.  Karen Seymour, of the Trade Unionist and Socailist Coalition, completes the mayoral ballot.  The winner of the mayoral election may not necessarily have control of the council: in 2019 the Mansfield Independents gained the council majority from Labour while the mayoralty went the other way.
</p><p>
<img alt="Broxtowe, 2019" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/broxtowe19s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Most other Nottinghamshire councils have large majorities: for the Conservatives in Newark and Sherwood district and in Rushcliffe, for Labour in Nottingham and Gedling and for the Ashfield Independents in Ashfield.  The personality cult of the Ashfield Independents leader Jason Zadrozny remains strong and this column hasn't seen any need to reassess that following his arrest last December on suspicion of fraud and money laundering.  Instead we'll focus on <b>Broxtowe</b> district, which is based on western Nottingham suburbs and satellite towns such as Beeston and Eastwood, on the eastern side of the River Erewash.  This went hung in 2019 and an anti-Conservative coalition is running the show: the 2019 elections returned 20 Conservative councillors, 14 Labour, 7 Lib Dems, 2 Independents and an Ashfield Independent (a small corner of the district is part of the Ashfield parliamentary seat).  Despite the seat count Labour actually polled more votes than the Conservatives here in 2019, suggesting that there are a lot of Conservative councillors sitting on small majorities.
</p><p>
<img alt="NE Lincs, 2019" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2018/ne-lincs18s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Going forward there will only be two East Midlands councils which use the thirds electoral system.  One of those is Lincoln, which has a secure Labour majority (the city council covers a smaller area than the parliamentary seat); the other is <b>North East Lincolnshire</b>, which is based on the twin towns of Grimsby and Cleethorpes.  This has a large Conservative majority which is not under threat - 30 Conservative councillors against 8 Labour, 3 Lib Dems and an independent.  Labour recovered from their 2021 wipeout to hold four wards last year, and this year they are defending the same four wards: a repeat of the 2022 results would result in only one change, an independent gain in Freshney ward from the Conservatives.
</p><p>
<img alt="E Lindsey, 2019" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/e-lindsey19s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
The Conservatives run all other Lincolnshire districts, although not all with majorities.  They have mislaid majorities on Boston and West Lindsey councils as a result of defections; the Lib Dems could challenge in West Lindsey, while Boston has a large number of independent councillors.  North Kesteven actually returned a majoriy of independent councillors in 2019, although the independents were not a united bloc and the Conservatives were able to peel enough of them off to stay in control.  Of the three Lincolnshire councils with Conservative majorities at present, the most marginal is <b>East Lindsey</b> council (above) which is one of those rural councils which traditionally has lots of independents: in 2019 there were 29 Conservatives, 12 independents, 7 Labour, 6 Skegness localists and a Lib Dem.
</p><p>
Before we leave Lincolnshire, there is a by-election for the county council to bring you.  This is in the <em>Eagle and Hykeham West</em> division, which covers part of the town of North Hykeham together with a number of villages to the west of Lincoln, the largest of which is Skellingthorpe.  This area voted strongly for independent councillors in the 2019 North Kesteven elections and just as strongly for the Conservatives in the 2021 Lincolnshire county elections; the Tories are defending a 64-16 majority over independent candidate Nikki Dillon.  Alan Briggs defends for the Conservatives, Dillon is back for another go, and for some reason this by-election has attracted a lot of candidates: also standing are Calum Watt for Labour, Tony Richardson for the Lib Dems, Sally Horscroft for the Greens, Charles Overton for the Lincolnshire Independents, Charles Shaw for the continuing Liberal Party, and Nicola Smith for Reform UK.
</p><p>
<img alt="Rutland, 2019" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/rutland19s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Over the last council term England's "smallest" "county" has been a disaster area for the Conservatives.  In 2019 the Tories won 15 seats in <b>Rutland</b> against 8 independents, 3 Lib Dems and a Green; four years later the Conservative group has fallen apart like a pack of cards and has lost by-elections left, right and centre.  (Well, maybe just left and centre.)  There are only six Rutland Conservative councillors left now; such is the disarray in the local party that they could not even find a candidate to defend a by-election last year in Oakham which the Lib Dems gained without a contest.  Goodness knows what will happen here.
</p><p>
<img alt="NW Leics, 2019" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/nw-leics19s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Which brings us to Leicestershire, where all of the district councillors are up for election.  Of the county's eight districts, Harborough (the south of the county around Market Harborough), Melton and Charnwood (covering Loughborough and the north of the county) have large Conservative majorities, while Hinckley and Bosworth and the Leicester suburbs of Oadby and Wigston have large Liberal Democrat majorities.  <b>North West Leicestershire</b> could be in play if Labour can recover in the former coalfield: the 2019 elections here returned 20 Conservative councillors, 10 Labour, 4 Lib Dems, 3 independents and a Green, and the Conservatives have since gained Ibstock East in a by-election.
</p><p>
<img alt="Blaby, 2019" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/blaby19s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
The most marginal Leicestershire district at present is <b>Blaby</b> which covers a number of Leicester's south-western suburbs, although this looks safe enough based on the 2019 results which gave 25 Conservative councillors against 6 each for Labour and the Lib Dems, a Green and an independent.  The Conservative majority is now down to 21 out of 39, but that is partly down to two Conservative seats presently being vacant.
</p><p>
<img alt="Leicester, 2019" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/leicester19s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
I've saved possibly the most interesting council in the East Midlands till last.  <b>Leicester</b> is definitely one to watch, although you might want to watch it through your fingers if you're of a Labour persuasion.  In 2019 Labour won 53 out of 54 seats on the city council, with a Lib Dem being the one that got away; in December 2018 the party had polled 87% of the vote in a high-turnout by-election in Belgrave ward, which is the most strongly-Hindu ward in the country according to the 2021 census (69.4%).
</p><p>
Whatever message Labour had that was resonating with Hindu voters then, it's not resonating now.  In the last two years Labour has had four by-elections to defend in the strongly-Hindu Leicester East constituency: they lost two to the Conservatives and only narrowly held off the Tories in the other two.  The most recent by-election, in North Evington ward last October, saw Labour not only lose the seat but fall to third place behind the Greens with just 23% of the vote; this in a ward where the Labour slate polled 72% in May 2019.  The sense of a local party in crisis is only deepened by the fact that a large number of senior Labour councillors were deselected shortly before this election.
</p><p>
What seems to link many of the deselected councillors together is losing out in a power struggle with Leicester's elected mayor.  If he is re-elected, Labour's Sir Peter Soulsby will enter his sixth decade in elected Leicester politics: he was first elected to the city council all the way back in 1973 as a 24-year-old, and there are very few councillors left now from those first elections to the "big-bang" reform of local government introduced by the Heath administration.  Soulsby was leader of Leicester city council from 1981 to 1994 and again from 1996 to 1999, served as MP for Leicester South from 2005 to 2011, and then left Parliament to become the city's elected mayor.  He was knighted in 1999 for services to local government.  Sir Peter's only period out of elected office was in 2003-05, after he lost his seat in the 2003 Leicester city council elections; during this period he also lost the Leicester South parliamentary by-election to the Lib Dems' Parmjit Singh Gill.
</p><p>
Sir Peter Soulsby has won all three Leicester mayoral elections to date with over 54% of the vote, and 2019 was his strongest result yet with a 61-17 lead over the Conservative candidate Baroness Verma.  He is going for a fourth term.  The Conservative candidate this time is Sanjay Modhwadia, who won the North Evington by-election last year; I wrote at the time that Modhwadia was "a businessman who is campaigning for support for Leicester's textile industry", which made him a perfect fit for a ward which contains a large number of Leicester's textile factories and was one of the areas of the UK hardest-hit by the first COVID wave.  Don't forget, Leicester never properly came out of the first lockdown.  Also standing are Mags Lewis for the Green Party, former Leicester South MP Parmjit Singh Gill for the Lib Dems, Steve Score for the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition and independent candidate Rita Patel, who is an outgoing councillor for Rushey Mead ward and was one of the Leicester Labour councillors who was deslected ahead of this year's elections.
</p><p>
There are no local elections this year in Northamptonshire.

<img alt="Stoke-on-Trent, 2019" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/stoke19s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
We'll start our tour of the West Midlands region with a city that has perenially interesting politics, although it's not featured too much in this column in recent years.  The 2019 elections to <b>Stoke-on-Trent</b> council returned a very balanced council with 16 Labour councillors, 15 Conservatives, 12 City Independents and one other independent.  At the time the City Independents and the Conservatives were running the council in coalition; the Tories have since dumped their coalition partners, gained two seats in by-elections from virtually nowhere, and picked up some defectors from the City Independents to now hold half of the council, 22 seats out of 44.  Stoke also now has a full slate of three Conservative MPs.  It's a long way back from here for the city's Labour group, which lost control of the Six Towns in 2015.

</p><p>
There are no elections this year for the other Potteries local authority, Newcastle-under-Lyme.  Elsewhere in Staffordshire, over the last council term the Conservatives have gained a majority on <b>Staffordshire Moorlands</b> council through by-election and defection gains, but that majority is down to one seat - 29 out of 56 - after a double by-election in Biddulph North ward in January resulted in two Labour gains.
</p><p>
<img alt="Stafford, 2019" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/stafford19s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
<b>Stafford</b>, however, has gone the other way after two Conservative councillors went independent.  Because the Tories had won 22 out of 40 seats in 2019, that wiped out their majority.  In opposition are 10 Labour, now 9 independents and a Green councillor.
</p><p>
<img alt="E Staffs, 2019" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/e-staffs19s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Burton-on-Trent and Uttoxeter are covered by the <b>East Staffordshire</b> district, which has a rather small Conservative majority.  In 2019 the Tories won 25 seats here against 10 Labour, 3 independents and a Lib Dem; Labour has since gained one of the independent seats in a by-election.  There are a number of marginal wards in Burton which the Conservatives will want to keep an eye on.
</p><p>
<img alt="Cannock Chase, 2019" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/cannock-chase19s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
The Conservatives have secure majorities in the South Staffordshire, Lichfield and Tamworth districts.  <b>Cannock Chase</b>, however, has been brought into play by some developments over the last term.  Following the 2022 elections the Conservatives were still gaining seats in this district and they were up to a majority of 25 out of 41.  This is mostly based on an extraordinary performance in 2021 when the Conservatives won 12 wards out of a possible 13 and gained 9 seats from Labour.  2022 was more of a <em>status quo ante</em> performance, with the Conservatives winning 6 wards, Labour 5 and the Greens and Lib Dems one each.  This year the Conservatives are defending all of the six wards they won last May plus Hagley ward in Rugeley, which didn't poll last year.
</p><p>
On paper, that should have been enough for me to project a continued Conservative majority here at least until 2024; but events have intervened.  Labour have gained two by-elections from the Conservatives over the last term, one of which was in Etching Hill and the Heath ward which the Tories are defending this year; and another Conservative councillor has recently resigned forcing a by-election in Cannock East ward, which voted Labour last May.  The Tories are now down to 21 seats out of 41 plus that vacancy; if Labour can repeat the by-election gain in Etching Hill and gain the by-election seat in Cannock East, then Cannock Chase will be back in No Overall Control - and Labour will be well-placed to make large gains in 2024.
</p><p>
<img alt="Telford, 2019" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/telford-wrekin19s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
In Shropshire this year there are elections only for <b>Telford and Wrekin</b> council, which has new ward boundaries - the map above is for the old wards.  Rather like Bassetlaw in the East Midlands, this area's polls had an interesting contrast in 2019 between a large Labour win in the local elections and a large Conservative win at the Telford parliamentary seat in the general election.  Unlike Bassetlaw, this is not in a coalfield context: Telford is a New Town built to relieve pressure on the urban West Midlands.
</p><p>
<img alt="Solihull, 2019" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/solihull19s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Which is where we go to next.  There are no elections in Birmingham this year; of the six other West Midlands metropolitan boroughs, three (Dudley, Solihull and Walsall) have Conservative majorities and three (Coventry, Sandwell and Wolverhampton) have Labour majorities.  The most marginal of these is <b>Solihull</b> where the Conservatives are on 28 out of 51, against 14 councillors for the Green Party (most of whom represent the highly-deprived Castle Bromwich area), 5 Lib Dems and 4 independents.  The par score is for the Conservatives to gain a seat here: in 2022 they won the Birmingham stockbroker belt of Knowle and the high-rise tower blocks of Castle Bromwich (defended this year by an independent and the Greens respectively) while losing Olton ward to the Lib Dems.
</p><p>
<img alt="Rugby, 2019" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2015/rugby15s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
In Warwickshire, there are no elections this year to Nuneaton and Bedworth council.  While Labour might want to make inroads on the large Conservative majority in the former coalfields of North Warwickshire for old times' sake, I'll focus here on <b>Rugby</b> where a small Conservative majority is at risk.  Rugby council currently stands at 23 Conservatives, 10 Labour and 9 Lib Dems; a repeat of the 2022 results would see Labour gain two wards from the Conservatives, Admirals/Cawston and Coton/Boughton on the western and northern edges of Rugby town repsectively.  That would be enough to wipe out the Conservative majority, although it would still leave the Tories with half of the 42 seats.
</p><p>
<img alt="Stratford-on-Avon, 2019" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/stratford-avon19s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
The Conservatives are defending an even smaller majority in <b>Stratford-on-Avon</b>, a large rural district covering most of southern Warwickshire.  The Lib Dems staged a recovery here in the 2019 election which finished with 20 Conservatives, 11 Lib Dems, 4 independents and 1 Green; a Conservative councillor has since gone independent cutting the Tory majority to 19 out of 36.
</p><p>
<img alt="Warwick, 2019" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/warwick19s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
<b>Warwick</b> is a hung council and a rather precariously balanced one.  The 2019 elections here returned 19 Conservative councillors, 9 Lib Dems, 8 Greens, 5 Labour and 3 Whitnash Residents; the Conservatives and Whitnash Residents formed a coalition which controls half of the 44 seats.  It will only take one seat loss for that coalition to become untenable, and none of the nine Conservative seats in Warwick town look particularly safe.
</p><p>
<img alt="Redditch, 2019" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/redditch19s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Moving into Worcestershire, we can see a Labour recovery forming in the New Town of Redditch.  Redditch Labour were facing a par score of wipeout at the 2022 elections, but held all the


<!--
In the West Midlands region there are elections for the whole of Birmingham and Newcastle-under-Lyme councils, half of Nuneaton and Bedworth council, and one-third of the council in Cannock Chase, Redditch, Rugby, Tamworth, Worcester and the remaining six West Midlands boroughs.  There are no local elections this year in Shropshire or Herefordshire.
</p><p>
<img alt="Redditch, 2018" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2018/redditch18s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
This was a region where the Conservatives did very well in last year's local elections, gaining overall control of <b>Cannock Chase</b> (for the first time), <b>Dudley</b>, <b>Nuneaton and Bedworth</b>, and <b>Worcester</b> and greatly increasing their majority on <b>Redditch</b> council (above).  With those good Conservative years in the bank it will be difficult for Labour to make headway this year in those councils - indeed in Redditch the Labour party face wipeout if last year's results are repeated.
</p><p>
<img alt="Birmingham, 2018" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2018/birmingham18s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
The big prize here will be the city of <b>Birmingham</b>, where the whole council is up for election.  Birmingham last held elections in 2018 when Labour won 67 seats, the Conservatives 25, the Lib Dems 8 and the Greens 1.  The comfortable Labour hold in the Erdington parliamentary by-election two months ago suggests that Labour are on course to retain control here, although possibly with a reduced majority.  Of the other big cities in the West Midlands metropolitan area, <b>Wolverhampton</b> saw large Conservative gains last year while <b>Coventry</b>'s politics have been affected by a damaging and long-running strike by bin lorry drivers; both of those cities have almost-impregnable Labour majorities but watch for seat changes there.
</p><p>
<img alt="Newcastle-under-Lyme, 2018" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2018/newcastle-lyme18s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Recent polling analysis from Electoral Calculus has suggested that Labour could be on course to gain control of <b>Newcastle-under-Lyme</b> council in Staffordshire.  This district isn't just the western half of the Potteries, as it also takes in Kidsgrove and a small rural hinterland.  Newcastle council was hung in 2018: the Conservatives polled the most votes, but Labour ended up as the largest party with 20 seats against 18 Conservatives, 3 independents and 3 Lib Dems.  All of the independent councillors have since joined the Conservative group, and by-election gains mean this council now has a Conservative majority.  One of those by-election gains came last November in Knutton ward <a href="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/irbu">with a 25% swing from Labour</a>, and earlier in 2021 the Conservatives won all 9 of the district's Staffordshire county council divisions.  Labour will be doing very well if they hold what they have in Newcastle-under-Lyme, never mind challenging for a majority.
</p><p>
<img alt="Staffs Moorlands, Cheadle SE" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/staffs-moorlands-cheadle-se.webp"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
There is a potentially-crucial by-election taking place in this region to Staffordshire Moorlands council, in the town of Cheadle.  <a href="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/ix1e">Cheadle South East</a> ward is holding its second by-election since the 2019 council elections, which returned independent councillors Richard Alcock and Peter Elkin.  Alcock and Elkin were local government veterans who were first elected back in the early 1990s.  Since the 2003 elections, when the current ward boundaries were introduced, Alcock had held one of Cheadle South East's two seats continuously, with the other seat alternating between Elkin and the Conservatives at each election.
</p><p>
Peter Elkin retired from his upholstery trade some years ago, and he stood down from the council in December 2020; true to form, the resulting by-election in May 2021 went to the Conservatives rather comfortably.  Richard Alcock, who was a dairy farmer, then passed away in January causing this by-election.  Abigail Wilkinson, who was runner-up here in the 2019 election, will try to succeed Alcock as an independent candidate, while the Conservative candidate is Zenobia Routledge and Labour have selected Matthew Spooner.  Staffordshire Moorlands council is currently run by a Conservative-Independent alliance, but the Conservatives are not far short of a majority and they will hold half the seats on the council if they gain this by-election.
</p><p>
<h2 id="sw">South West</h2>
</p><p>
The South West is a relatively quiet region this year.  There are elections this year for half of Cheltenham council, one-third of Swindon, Exeter and Plymouth councils and the whole of Somerset county council.  There are no local elections this year in Cornwall, Dorset, Wiltshire or the former county of Avon.
</p><p>
<img alt="Swindon, 2018" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2018/swindon18s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Three of these councils are safe.  <b>Cheltenham</b> council has a large Lib Dem majority; the parliamentary seat here is a top Liberal Democrat target, but the party may well go slightly backwards on the council because they are defending a strong result from 2018.  <b>Swindon</b> council (above) is now firmly in the Conservative column but should be watched nonetheless given that the town has two marginal parliamentary seats, while the Labour majority in <b>Exeter</b> (below) should continue even though the party have four casual vacancies to defend this year.
</p><p>
<img alt="Exeter, 2018" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2018/exeter18s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Although there are no local elections this year in <b>Bristol</b>s, the voters there will nonetheless be called to the polls for a referendum on whether to abolish the city's elected mayoralty and move to the council being run under the committee system.  If there is a vote for change, it will apply from May 2024 when the term of Marvin Rees, the current Labour mayor, ends.
</p><p>
<img alt="Somerset CC, 2017" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2017/somerset17s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
The big prize in the South West will be the election to <b>Somerset county council</b>, which will become the unitary council for Somerset in 2023 when the districts under it are abolished.  This last went to the polls in 2017 when the Conservatives won a large majority - 35 seats, against 12 Lib Dems, 3 Labour, 3 independents and 2 Greens.  The county council is doubling in size this year, so multiply those figures by 2 for a par score.  This Conservative majority is large but not particularly strong, and there are a lot of marginal divisions here.
</p><p>
The 2019 Somerset district council results were not good for the Conservatives who now only control Sedgemoor council.  That year the Liberal Democrats gained control of South Somerset, surprisingly won a majority in the new district of Somerset West and Taunton (which now faces abolition after just four years in operation), and became the largest party on Mendip council.  These county elections could be difficult for the Conservatives to hold, and the Liberal Democrats will think they have a genuine chance of gaining overall control of Somerset county council - a feat they last achieved in 2005.
</p><p>
<img alt="Plymouth, 2018" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2018/plymouth18s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Finally we come to <b>Plymouth</b>, where the Conservatives gained nine seats last year to take minority control.  Plymouth council is a mess, with the last count having 23 Labour councillors, 22 Conservatives and 12 independents, who are divided between a Conservative splinter group of nine and a Labour splinter group of three.  The independents combined to no-confidence the Conservative council leader in March, and the party has had to find a replacement leader going into this election campaign.  A Labour bounceback looks out of the question as the party are defending 11 seats this year, including five wards the Conservatives won in 2021; a repeat of that performance will deliver a Conservative majority regardless of the party's current split here.
</p><p>
<h2 id="ea">Eastern</h2>
</p><p>
We now move to the Eastern region, starting in Cambridgeshire.  This is a particularly busy area this year, with one-third of Cambridge and Peterborough councils up together with the whole of Huntingdonshire and South Cambridgeshire districts.  Only the east side of the county (East Cambridgeshire and Fenland districts) misses out on the fun.
</p><p>
<img alt="Peterborough, 2018" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2018/peterborough18s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
<b>Peterborough</b> has been run by the Conservatives for some years but has been in and out of No Overall Control during that time.  We are currently in a No Overall Control phase, with 28 Conservative seats, 17 Labour, 8 Lib Dems (including one vacant seat), 3 Greens, 3 Werrington First councillors and an ex-Conservative independent.  The Conservatives did very well here in 2021, winning 16 seats out of a possible 21; however, they were defending a difficult ward map and that only represented a net gain of one.  By contrast only seven Conservative seats are up for re-election this year, and a repeat of last year's performance will deliver a Conservative majority here.
</p><p>
<img alt="Hunts, 2018" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2018/hunts18s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
South of Peterborough we come to <b>Huntingdonshire</b> which has a Conservative majority: the 2018 elections delivered 30 seats against 7 Lib Dems, 6 councillors from the St Neots Independent Group, 5 independents and 4 Labour.  There have been a lot of by-elections here since, but the only net change is Labour losing a seat to the independents after one of the Labour councillors was elected as Mayor of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough.  The Conservatives gained county council seats here in 2021, a year in which they lost control of the county council, so their machine here may well be in good shape.
</p><p>
<img alt="S Cambs, 2018" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2018/s-cambs18s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
The Tory collapse on the county council instead came in South Cambridgeshire district where the Lib Dems performed very well in 2021.  That came off the back of a near-miss in the South Cambridgeshire constituency at the 2019 general election and the Lib Dems winning control of the district in 2018.  Nothing suggests that's going to change in the 2022 district elections.  South Cambridgeshire district completely surrounds the city of <b>Cambridge</b>, whose entire council was up last year on new ward boundaries; Labour have a secure-looking majority here.
</p><p>
<img alt="Norwich, 2019" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/norwich19s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
The only other councils in East Anglia holding ordinary elections this year are the city of Norwich and the borough of Ipswich.  <b>Norwich</b> (yes, the city boundary really does look like that) has a Labour majority with the Greens forming the main opposition, and last year's local elections don't suggest any major change to that pattern is incoming.  The councillors here were last elected in 2019 following ward boundary changes.
</p><p>
<img alt="Ipswich, 2018" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2018/ipswich18s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
By contrast Labour lost six seats in <b>Ipswich</b> to the Conservatives last year; a repeat of that performance would deliver four more Conservative gains this year.  With Labour starting on 29 seats out of 48 that would still be a Labour majority, but only just.
</p><p>
<img alt="S Norfolk, Mulbarton/Stoke Holy X" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/s-norfolk-mulbarton-stoke-holy-x.webp"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
We also have a by-election taking place to South Norfolk council, in the <a href="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/ilcu">Mulbarton and Stoke Holy Cross</a> ward.  This is a large rural area covering nine parishes to the south of Norwich and the east of Wymondham.  Around 41% of the ward's electors live in Mulbarton, with Stoke Holy Cross - the original home of the mustard manufacturer Colman's, which was founded here in 1814 - being the only other parish here with over 1,000 electors.  The ward split its three seats between two Conservatives and a Lib Dem in 2019; this by-election is for the Liberal Democrats' seat, and their defending candidate Ian Spratt faces competition from Silvia Schmidtova of the Conservatives, John Martin for Labour, Andrew Pond for Reform UK and Tom Williamson of the Green Party.
</p><p>
<img alt="Chelmsford, Lt Baddow/Danbury/Sandon" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/chelmsford-lt-baddow-danbury-sandon.webp"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
The other standalone by-election in this region is to Chelmsford council in Essex, and falls in the <a href="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/insd">Little Baddow, Danbury and Sandon</a> ward, a large ward covering the countryside immediately to the east of Chelmsford.  This is a safe Conservative ward and their defending candidate Steph Scott should have little trouble despatching her opponents Sue Baker (Lib Dem) and Stephen Capper (Lab).
</p><p>
<img alt="Colchester, 2018" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2018/colchester18s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Essex and Hertfordshire have a large number of councils which hold thirds elections.  <b>Colchester</b> council has been under No Overall Control for some time, but saw a change of control after the 2021 elections when the Highwoods Independents dumped their Labour and Lib Dem coalition partners and formed an administration with the Conservatives instead.  Going into these elections the Conservatives have 23 seats, the Lib Dems have 12 (one of which is vacant), Labour are on 11, the Highwoods Independents have 3 and the Green Party have 2.  The ruling coalition has a majority of one, and that is in some danger: the Conservatives are defending a difficult ward map this time round, and a repeat of last year's performance would result in them losing three seats (St Anne's/St John's and Shrub End to the Lib Dems, Castle to the Greens).
</p><p>
<img alt="Southend, 2018" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2018/southend18s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Most of the Essex councils up this year are concentrated on the Thames estuary, starting with England's newest city of <b>Southend-on-Sea</b>.  This is currently hung, with 23 Conservative councillors, 13 Labour plus one vacancy, 9 independents and 5 Lib Dems.  The Conservatives need three gains for overall control, and if they can match last year's performance they will get there.
</p><p>
<img alt="Castle Point, 2018" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2018/castle-point18s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
The Tories are on the defensive next door in Castle Point, covering Canvey Island and Benfleet.  Canvey returns localist councillors in local elections, while the mainland normally returns Conservative councillors; however, the Conservatives suddenly started losing mainland seats to independents here last year, leaving them with a majority of one on the council.  The Tories have nine seats to defend this year, three of which are in wards which voted for independent councillors in 2021; and they need to hold every one of them to preserve their majority.
</p><p>
<img alt="Basildon, 2018" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2018/basildon18s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
The Conservatives gained overall control of <b>Basildon</b> council last year, and now hold 25 seats against 10 Labour and seven independents or localists.  They are defending nine wards this year, but Labour will have to strike back hard to force the council straight back into no overall control.
</p><p>
<img alt="Thurrock, 2018" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2018/thurrock18s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
<b>Thurrock</b> council now has a similar Conservative majority after the party absorbed most of the Thurrock Independents and performed extremely well in the 2021 elections.  Labour only held two wards that year, and they have nine seats to defend this time round.  Expect an increased Conservative majority.
</p><p>
<img alt="Harlow, 2018" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2018/harlow18s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
The Conservatives have long-standing majority control of <b>Rochford</b>, <b>Brentwood</b> and <b>Epping Forest</b> districts, and gained control of <b>Harlow</b> (above) in 2021 with an extremely impressive performance.  There are 12 Labour councillors left in Harlow against 21 Conservatives, and half of the Labour group is up for re-election this time; there is no chance of an immediate left-wing bounceback here.
</p><p>
Most of the districts in Hertfordshire have elections for a third of their council, with the main exception being <b>St Albans</b> where the whole council is up this year on new ward boundaries.  St Albans council was gained by the Liberal Democrats last year but their majority is small: they have 30 seats against 23 Conservatives, 2 Labour, 2 independents and 1 Green.  The Lib Dems can now probably count on winning all or nearly all of the 24 seats in St Albans proper, and with the council going down in size to 56 seats they won't need to win much outside the city to hold their majority.
</p><p>
<img alt="Watford, 2018" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2018/watford18s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
The Liberal Democrats have secure majorities on <b>Watford</b> council (above) and in the <b>Three Rivers</b> district which surrounds Watford on three seats.  This year sees the sixth election for the <b>Mayor of Watford</b>.  In 2018 the new Lib Dem candidate Peter Taylor came very close to winning in the first round, leading 49-34 on first preferences against Labour; that extended to 61-39 in the runoff after Taylor picked up most of the transfers from the Conservatives.  Taylor is seeking a second term as mayor, and he is opposed by two BAME candidates: Labour's Asif Khan is a Watford councillor for Leggatts ward and Hertfordshire county councillor for North Watford, while the Conservatives have selected Binta Mehta-Parmar.
</p><p>
<img alt="Welwyn Hatfield, 2018" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2018/welhat18s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
There are better Conservative prospects in the east of Hertfordshire.  <b>Broxbourne</b> council is completely safe for them, and they are now back in control of <b>Welwyn Hatfield</b> district (above) following a very impressive performance last year in which fifteen of the borough's 17 wards voted Conservative.  The Tories are only defending eight seats this year, so a continued Tory majority looks nailed on.
</p><p>
<img alt="N Herts, 2018" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2018/n-herts18s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
The best Labour prospects in Hertfordshire are in the north of the county.  They are securely in control of <b>Stevenage</b>, and also run the hung <b>North Hertfordshire</b> council (above) in coalition with the Lib Dems.  The coalition has a small majority, with 15 Labour and 11 Lib Dems opposed by 23 Conservatives who need two gains to take control.  On the basis of the 2021 results this is a realistic possibility, but a very poor by-election result in Hitchin in March should give the Tories pause for thought.
</p><p>
There are no local elections this year in Bedfordshire.

<img alt="Milton Keynes, 2018" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2018/mk18s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
We move into the South East region by way of the New City of <b>Milton Keynes</b>, which has had a hung council since 2006.  As in North Hertfordshire, a Labour/Lib Dem coalition is running the show here: there are 19 Labour and 13 Lib Dem councillors against 24 Conservatives and one independent.  The Conservatives need five gains for a majority here; a repeat of last year's results would deliver that, but this may prove a tall order given the change in the political weather over the last twelve months.  Expect the coalition to continue.
</p><p>
<img alt="W Oxon, 2018" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2018/w-oxon18s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
In Oxfordshire the Conservatives look securely in control of <b>Cherwell</b> district.  <b>West Oxfordshire</b> (above) has a smaller Tory majority after the party lost three seats last year, with 27 Conservative councillors against 10 Lib Dems, 8 Labour, 3 independents and a Green councillor; however, the wards the Conservatives are defending this year look safe enough.  The city of <b>Oxford</b> got new ward boundaries last year which preserved a large Labour majority; there's little prospect of this changing.

Oxfordshire's Vale of White Horse district has a by-election in <a href="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/iyyr">Steventon and the Hanneys</a> ward, which covers four parishes along the Great Western main line to the north of Wantage.  This seat is vacated by the Conservatives' Matthew Barber, a former leader of the council who was elected last year as the Thames Valley Police and Crime Commissioner.  Barber was run close in 2019 by the Liberal Democrats; Louise Brown is the defending Conservative candidate, the Lib Dems' Sally Povolotsky may fancy her chances of a gain, while independent candidate David Corps also stands.
</p><p>
Moving to Berkshire, the whole of <b>Reading</b> council is up for election on new ward boundaries.  This is a council of TV stars: the Reading University team who came very close to winning the last series of <em>University Challenge</em> includes PhD student Margaret Ounsley, who was a Labour councillor here many years ago; while the Conservative group on the current council includes the former BBC newsreader and journalist Clarence Mitchell, who is seeking re-election.  The outgoing council has a Labour majority with 29 councillors against nine Conservatives, 5 Greens, 2 Lib Dems and an ex-Labour independent; this should be safe enough in the current political climate.
</p><p>
<img alt="Wokingham, 2018" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2018/wokingham18s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Part of the reason for that is that Reading council doesn't cover the whole of the Reading urban area; some of its western suburbs are in West Berkshire where there are no elections this year, while much of the eastern side of the built-up area is covered by the bizarrely-drawn <b>Wokingham</b> district.  The Tories have been underperforming in Wokingham for some time, and they lost two more seats last year to fall to 31 against 18 Lib Dems, 3 Labour (one of which is vacant) and 2 independents.  The opposition need four gains to send the council into No Overall Control; but a lot of the low-hanging fruit has now gone, and they will need to do better than in 2021 to make further progress.
</p><p>
<img alt="Slough, 2018" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2018/slough18s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
The other Berkshire council holding elections this year is <b>Slough</b>, where the council has run out of money and the friendly bombs - sorry, the Commissioners have been sent in.  Despite that, the borough has an impregnable Labour majority.
</p><p>
<img alt="Hart, 2018" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2018/hart18s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Moving over the border into Hampshire, <b>Rushmoor</b> council (Farnborough and Aldershot, or possibly Aldershot and Farnborough) has a strong Conservative majority.  The neighbouring <b>Hart</b> district (shown above, covering Fleet and nearby towns) is hung; the Conservatives are the largest party with 12 seats against 10 each for the Liberal Democrats and the Community Campaign (Hart), with one independent.  The Lib Dems and the Community Campaign have had an electoral pact and a coalition agreement here for some years, and they will continue to run the council between them.
</p><p>
The whole of <b>Basingstoke and Deane</b> council was up last year with new wards.  The Conservatives have a majority here with 33 seats against 10 Labour, 6 independents and 5 Lib Dems.  Barring a complete meltdown the Tories should remain in control here.  Further down the M3 <b>Eastleigh</b> council is completely safe for the Liberal Democrats and <b>Winchester</b> council isn't much less safe for them.
</p><p>
<img alt="Southampton, 2018" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2018/southampton18s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
The Conservatives performed well last year to take overall control of <b>Southampton</b> by a narrow margin: they have 25 council seats against 23 for Labour, so one net loss and that majority is gone.  The ward map is in their favour as the Conservatives are only defending seven wards this year; following a by-election gain in Coxford ward, Labour are defending the other nine wards.
</p><p>
Also on the Hampshire coast, the Conservatives are firmly in control of <b>Fareham</b> and <b>Havant</b> councils.  They also control <b>Gosport</b> council, but not by a large majority: there are 19 Conservative councillors here against 14 Lib Dems and one Labour.  The Lib Dems hugely punch above their weight here in vote terms: the 2021 votes here fell 51% to the Conservatives, 24% to the Lib Dems and 22% to Labour, which England's first-past-the-post system translated into eleven seats for the Conservatives, six Lib Dems and a Labour wipeout.  The whole council is up for election this year with new ward boundaries and a reduction from 34 to 28 councillors; given that sort of profile it's very difficult to predict what will happen here, but if this column had to make a prediction it would be for a continued Conservative majority in Gosport.
</p><p>
<img alt="Portsmouth, 2018" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2018/portsmouth18s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
We finish with Hampshire by travelling offshore to <b>Portsmouth</b>, the city located on its own island in the Solent.  The Conservatives are the largest party on Portsmouth council with 17 seats, but the city is run by a minority Lib Dem administration with 15 seats; the remaining councillors are 7 Labour and 3 independents.  The Lib Dems went backwards on Portsmouth council in 2021, but the ward map is easier for them on this occasion; a repeat of last year's results would see the Liberal Democrats gain two seats from Labour to become the largest party, while the Conservatives are under pressure from an independent challenge in the volatile council-estate ward of Paulsgrove.  Portsmouth is one of the few remaining councils where Andrew's Previews has never covered a by-election in detail; this column has been going in some form for almost twelve years now, so the city council must be doing something right.
</p><p>
<img alt="Adur, 2018" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2018/adur18s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
In West Sussex we have elections for half of Adur council and one-third of Crawley and Worthing councils.  <b>Adur</b> (based on the coastal strip towns between Worthing and Hove) saw a good Conservative performance last year and the party is not in serious danger there.  The other two are much more interesting.
</p><p>
<img alt="Crawley, 2019" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/crawley19s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
<b>Crawley</b> council has had an unstable situation for some time now.  The council had been under Labour control for some years with small majorities, before finally tipping into No Overall Control at the 2021 election.  The Conservatives are now the largest party with 18 of the 36 seats, but the 17-strong Labour group has remained in control thanks to an alliance with the single independent councillor and the mayoral casting vote.  One Labour loss here will result in a Conservative majority, and Labour are defending two seats this year which voted Conservative last year.  The councillors up for election in Crawley were last elected in 2019 when the current ward boundaries were introduced.
</p><p>
<img alt="Worthing, 2018" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2018/worthing18s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Five years ago, the seaside resort of <b>Worthing</b> had no Labour councillors.  This column covered the election of the first Labour councillor there, at the Marine ward by-election in August 2017.  A full electoral cycle later, the once-large Conservative majority has disappeared to the extent that Labour are now the largest party on the council: they hold 17 seats against 17 Conservatives (who run the town as a minority), two Lib Dems, a Green and an independent.  We have the realistic prospect of Labour going from nothing to majority in Worthing in less than five years.
</p><p>
There are a number of reasons for this.  One is what appears to be poor vote distribution by the Conservatives and excellent targeting by Labour, which allows Labour to punch above their weight.  In the 2021 Worthing elections the Conservatives polled 51% against Labour's 41%, but the two parties won six wards each with the remaining ward going Lib Dem.  One is fast-moving demographic change.  Worthing is not your typical Sussex-by-the-Sea elephant's graveyard: the town has diversified its economy to give itself a year-round economic base, and this has attracted people of working age to move here as the cost of living in Brighton has become unaffordable.  And one is incompetence on the part of the Conservatives: as this column related last December, one of the Conservative councillors in Worthing was forced to resign last autumn after he was linked to a far-right group, and the resulting by-election in Marine ward (again) was lost to Labour.
</p><p>
This year the Conservatives are defending eight seats plus a casual vacancy in Castle ward, and Labour have seats to defend on Worthing council for the first time: four of them.  If they can play defence as well as attack, and repeat their 2021 result, then Labour will gain two wards from the Conservatives and win an overall majority on Worthing council for the first time.
</p><p>
<img alt="Hastings, 2018" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2018/hastings18s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Another Sussex-by-the-Sea town is <b>Hastings</b>, which is the only council holding elections today in East Sussex.  The Conservatives made significant gains here last year to sharply cut the Labour majority on Hastings council: there are now 18 Labour councillors, 12 Conservatives and 2 Greens.  Two Labour losses would tip the council into No Overall Control, and the party lost five seats last year.
</p><p>
<img alt="Brighton/Hove, Rottingdean Coastal" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/brighton-hove-rottingdean-coastal.webp"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
The only other East Sussex by-election this year is a by-election to Brighton and Hove council which forms the first half of a double-header.  We're in <a href="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/i64b">Rottingdean Coastal</a> here, a ward at the eastern end of the Brighton and Hove council area which covers the villages of Ovingdean, Rottingdean and Saltdean, together with the Brighton Marina and Roedean School, a girls' boarding school which isn't large enough to have a significant effect on the ward's census return.  Two current MPs are Old Roedeanians, the Conservatives' Flick Drummond (Meon Valley) and the Lib Dems' Layla Moran (Oxford West and Abingdon).  Roedean School lies on the top of the South Downs cliffedge, and much of this ward is within the South Downs National Park.
</p><p>
Rottingdean Coastal has normally been a safe Conservative ward this century, but the Tories lost one of the three seats here in 2019 to independent candidate Bridget Fishleigh who topped the poll; Labour weren't that far behind the Conservative slate that year either.  The by-election is defended by the Conservatives following the resignation of councillor Joe Miller, who first came to the attention of this column in 2013 when he contested a by-election in the neighbouring East Brighton ward at the age of 18.  Miller had served as a councillor for this ward since 2015, and in 2019 he was re-elected here at the same time as being elected to the neighbouring Lewes council.  He was the Conservative candidate for the local seat of Brighton Kemptown in the 2019 general election, and briefly served as deputy leader of Lewes council.
</p><p>
Miller resigned both his Brighton and Hove, and Lewes council seats in March for personal reasons, citing that he was getting married, was moving away from the area and wanted to concentrate on his consultancy business.  He has denied that his resignations were connected to a drink-driving charge for which he is currently awaiting trial.  The Lewes council by-election to replace Miller has been scheduled for next week and will be covered by Andrew's Previews then; for the Rottingdean Coastal by-election the defending Conservative candidate Lynda Hyde is opposed by independent candidates Stephen White and Alison Wright, Robert McIntosh for Labour, Libby Darling for the Green Party and Stewart Stone of the Lib Dems.
</p><p>
<img alt="Woking, 2018" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2018/woking18s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Moving northwards into Surrey, we can look at the wreckage from some appalling sets of local election results on the part of the Surrey Conservatives in recent years.  The party still has safe-looking majorities on <b>Runnymede</b>, and <b>Reigate and Banstead</b> councils; but <b>Mole Valley</b> is now controlled by the Liberal Democrats, <b>Elmbridge</b> (most of which is the constituency of the Deputy Prime Minister, Dominic Raab) has reverted to a coalition of the numerous Residents' Associations and the Lib Dems, and <b>Tandridge</b> council at the eastern end of the county is now run by independent and residents' councillors.  The map above is of <b>Woking</b> council which is on a knife-edge, with the minority Conservative administration holding 13 seats against 12 Lib Dems, 3 Labour and 2 independents.  A repeat of the 2021 results there would see the Lib Dems gain two seats to become the largest party.
</p><p>
<img alt="Tunbridge Wells, 2018" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2018/tunbridge-wells18s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Finally in this region, we come to the two councils in Kent which hold thirds elections.  One of these is <b>Tunbridge Wells</b> where the ruling Conservative administration has been treated by its voters in recent years with, for want of a better word, disgust.  In 2015 the Conservatives won a clean sweep here with 17 seats out of a possible 17; six years later they have lost control of the council, and a subsequent by-election loss has left the minority Conservative administration with 21 seats against 12 Lib Dems, 6 councillors from the Tunbridge Wells Alliance, 5 Labour and 3 independents.  The Liberal Democrats can expect gains of around three seats if last year's performance is repeated.
</p><p>
<img alt="Maidstone, 2018" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2018/maidstone18s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
<b>Maidstone</b>, however, swung the other way in 2021 with the Conservatives gaining an overall majority, partly thanks to a split in the local Lib Dems; there are now 29 Conservatives, 11 Lib Dems, 7 independents, 5 councillors from the Maidstone Group (a Lib Dem splinter), and 3 Labour.  The opposition parties will need to do much better than last year in order to stem further losses.
</p><p>
</p><p>
<img alt="Sevenoaks, Fawkham/W Kingsdown" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/sevenoaks-fawkham-w-kingsdown.webp"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Our last council by-election today is to Sevenoaks council, in the west of the county.  <a href="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/i7qe">Fawkham and West Kingsdown</a> ward is located in the North Downs, either side of the M20 motorway as it approaches the Great Wen.  This is a ward associated with high speeds.  Lizzy Yarnold, the most successful Olympic skeleton athlete of all time, grew up in West Kingsdown; also in West Kingsdown is the Brands Hatch racing circuit, which hosted the Formula 1 British Grand Prix in even years from 1964 to 1986.
</p><p>
Brands Hatch was also used as a venue in the 2012 London Paralympics, hosting cycling events.  Appropriately enough, two gold medals were won here by the motorsport driver Alex Zanardi, who had raced rather more powerful machines around the track here both before and after losing his legs in 2001.  Following that accident Zanardi had competed at Brands Hatch on a number of occasions in the World Touring Car Championship, finishing fourth and third in the two 2008 races.
</p><p>
Fawkham and West Kingsdown's elections are normally rather more sedate affairs.  The ward is safe Conservative as a rule, but the party did lose one of the three seats here to an independent candidate in 2019.  Long-serving Conservative councillor Faye Parkin passed away in January.  Emily Bulford will attempt to defend her seat for the Tories; the Greens (who were the only other party to stand here in 2019) have not returned, so Bulford's opposition comes from Jordan Selvey for Labour and Tristan Ward for the Lib Dems.
</p><p>
There are no local elections this year on the Isle of Wight.
</p><p>
<h2 id="lo">London</h2>
</p><p>
We now turn to the three parts of Great Britain where the whole of local government is up for election, starting with the 32 boroughs in Greater London.  The Local Government Boundary Commission has been hard at work here over the last cycle, and most boroughs will introduce new ward maps for this election which makes comparisons with previous years rather difficult.  The maps below are for the 2018 election results which use the old wards.
</p><p>
<img alt="Havering, 2018" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2018/havering18s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
The 2018 London borough elections saw the Labour party put in a good performance.  They won overall majorities in 21 boroughs, compared to seven Conservative and three Lib Dem councils.  The only hung council in the capital is <b>Havering</b>, which in 2018 returned 25 Conservatives, 23 councillors from various Residents Associations, 5 Labour and an independent.  Havering is the eastern end of Greater London, taking in Romford, Upminster and a number of former GLC overspill estates which used to have a significant populist right vote.  In many ways this is the least metropolitan of the London boroughs, and all other things being equal we might expect it to behave more like the Essex borough of Thurrock which it borders.  As we saw earlier Thurrock has a large Conservative majority now, but on the other hand Thurrock doesn't have organised Residents Associations.  The minority Conservative administration in Thurrock may well get the gains they need for a majority, but this is a rather unpredictable council.
</p><p>
<img alt="Redbridge, 2018" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2018/redbridge18s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
The neighbouring Redbridge council has seen major demographic change in this century, resulting in it swinging a mile to the left politically.  Redbridge had a Conservative majority continuously until 1994 and again from 2002 to 2009, but Labour won a majority here for the first time in 2014 and increased their lead to 51-12 at the 2018 elections.  This council is unlikely to be in play this time, but there could be problems for the council leader Jas Athwal who is seeking re-election in Mayfield ward: the poll there has had to be postponed until 26 May after one of the Conservative candidates died, meaning that Athwal will not be able to participate in the council's annual meeting the previous week.
</p><p>
<img alt="Newham, 2018" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2010/newham10s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Elsewhere in East London proper we have two mayoral elections to report on.  <b>Newham</b> council, covering West Ham and East Ham, is changing quickly with the redevelopment of the former industrial and dockland areas along the Thames and the Olympic site in the Lea Valley.  This is yet to feed through into elections, where Labour have held every council seat continuously since 2010 and have also held the <b>Newham mayoralty</b> since its creation in 2002.  The 2018 Newham mayoral election saw Labour's new candidate Rokhsana Fiaz win with 73% of the vote in the first round, and it would be foolish to bet against her securing a second term this time.  Fiaz is opposed by Attic Rahman for the Conservatives, Saleyha Ahsan for the Lib Dems, Simeon Ademolake for the Christian Peoples Alliance (which once had councillors in Newham), Lois Austin for the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition, Robert Callender for the Green Party and independent candidate Mehmood Mirza.  For the council election, it might be worth noting that the long-standing Newham redwash was broken here in last year's London mayor election where the Conservatives' Shaun Bailey carried Custom House ward.
</p><p>
<img alt="Tower Hamlets, 2018" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2018/tower-hamlets18s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Crossing the Lea from Newham we come to the 21st Century Rotten Borough of <b>Tower Hamlets</b>, which looks set to be just as rotten this time round.  I regret to report that Lutfur Rahman, the monstrously corrupt former mayor who was ejected by the Election Court in 2015 for the most fraudulent UK election campaign of modern times, has now served his five-year disqualification and he wants his old job back.  The 2018 local elections here returned 42 Labour councillors, 2 Conservatives and one councillor (Rabina Khan) from the Peoples Alliance of Tower Hamlets, the more moderate of the two factions the former Lutfurite councillors had split into.  In the mayoral election Labour's John Biggs, who won the by-election after Lutfur Rahman's disqualification, led in the first round with 48% of the vote against 17% for Rabina Khan of PATH and 14% for Ohid Ahmed of Aspire, the more hardline Lutfurite faction; the runoff saw Biggs defeat Khan by the wide margin of 73-27.  Aspire have since won two by-elections to the council and clearly have political momentum here.
</p><p>
John Biggs is seeking re-election for a third term as <b>Mayor of Tower Hamlets</b>.  Rabina Khan has wound up the Peoples Alliance of Tower Hamlets and joined the Liberal Democrats, who have nominated her as their mayoral candidate.  Fasten your seatbelts, as Lutfur Rahman is back as the Aspire candidate.  Also standing are Elliott Weaver for the Conservatives, Hugo Pierre for the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition, and independent candidates Pamela Holmes and Andrew Wood (Wood is one of the outgoing Conservative councillors).
</p><p>
<img alt="Hackney, 2018" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2018/hackney18s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
To the north of Tower Hamlets we have a third mayoral election in <b>Hackney</b>, another very safe Labour council but this time with little history of recent electoral fraud.  The 2018 council elections here returned 52 Labour councillors and 5 Conservatives, who have a base in the Hasidic enclave of Stamford Hill.  The Labour mayor Philip Glanville, who won a by-election in September 2016 after the previous mayor went off to work for Sadiq Khan, won re-election in the first round with a 66-11 lead over the Conservatives.  Glanville is seeking a second full term as <b>Mayor of Hackney</b>; the Conservatives have changed candidate to Oliver Hall; and also standing are Zoë Garbett for the Greens, Helen Baxter for the Lib Dems and Gwenton Sloley for a left-wing outfit called Hackney People Before Profit.
</p><p>
<img alt="Enfield, 2018" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2018/enfield18s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Further up the Lea Valley a mention is due for <b>Enfield</b> council.  This has a large Labour majority - the 2018 elections here returned 46 Labour councillors against 17 Conservatives - but the Conservatives have put in some very good performances in by-elections since 2018.  If Labour are having a worse night than expected this might be one to watch.
</p><p>
<img alt="Barnet, 2018" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2018/barnet18s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Conversely, it Labour have a better night than expected then we should keep an eye on the neighbouring <b>Barnet</b> council.  This was very close in 2014 but the Conservatives increased their majority in 2018, winning 38 seats against 25 for Labour.  It may not be a coincidence that Barnet has a very large Jewish population.  The new ward boundaries here are thought to be more favourable to Labour, but they will need to have mended their bridges with the local Jewish communities to make progress.
</p><p>
<img alt="Harrow, 2018" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2018/harrow18s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Next to Barnet lies another closely-fought outer London council: the borough of <b>Harrow</b>, which Labour have controlled since 2010 on fairly small majorities.  The 2018 elections here returned 35 Labour councillors against 28 Conservatives, with the Labour party polling the most votes in the borough for the first time this century.  Harrow has a fairly large Hindu population, a demographic which has swung to the Conservatives recently, and the borough returned large Conservative leads in last year's London mayor and assembly elections.
</p><p>
<img alt="Hounslow, 2018" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2014/hounslow14s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
One other outer London council which might be worth keeping an eye on is <b>Hounslow</b>.  I highlight this for the same reason as Enfield: there's a large Labour majority here which should continue, but Labour have had some distinctly unimpressive by-election results in the last term.
</p><p>
<img alt="Westminster, 2018" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2018/westminster18s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
There is some chatter online about the Labour campaign in <b>Westminster</b>.  This was very close in vote terms in 2018, when the Conservatives polled 42% in that city against 40% for Labour, but the Labour vote is poorly distributed and this translated into a 41-19 lead on the council for the Conservatives.  New ward boundaries may have reduced some of that Conservative advantage, but this is still a difficult mound to climb.
</p><p>
<img alt="Wandsworth, 2018" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2018/wandsworth18s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Labour have better prospects over the river in the land where Normal Rules Do Not Apply, the borough of <b>Wandsworth</b>.  The Labour party actually topped the poll in the 2018 Wandsworth elections with 38.6% against 38.1% for the Conservatives, but the aggressively low-tax Conservative administration which has run the borough for decades continued to defy political gravity: the Conservatives won 33 seats against 26 for Labour and one independent.  Labour have performed very well here at other levels of government since 2018: the Putney constituency was the only seat Labour gained from the Conservatives at the 2019 general election, and Labour carried the borough in the 2021 Mayor and Assembly elections.  In that particular context it doesn't hurt that Wandsworth is Sadiq Khan's home borough.  Could this be the year that the spell cast by the Wandsworth Conservatives is finally broken?
</p><p>
<img alt="Merton, 2018" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2018/merton18s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Next to Wandsworth is the borough of <b>Merton</b>, based on Morden and Wimbledon, which has a small Labour majority: the 2018 election returned 34 Labour councillors, 17 Conservatives, 6 Lib Dems and 3 residents' councillors.  The opposition councillors are concentrated in the Wimbledon parliamentary seat, which is a fascinating marginal where the Lib Dems had a go in 2019 and came up just short of defeating the Conservative MP.  The Labour majority should continue, but if the Lib Dems can maintain their momentum we could see some wild seat changes here.
</p><p>
<img alt="Sutton, 2018" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2018/sutton18s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
The Lib Dems are under some pressure to the south of Merton in the borough of <b>Sutton</b>, which they have controlled continuously since the 1990s.  Sutton is not like the nearby Lib Dem-controlled boroughs of Kingston and Richmond, in that those are places where the elite live whereas Sutton is much more normal suburbia with a better appeal for the Johnson brand of Conservatism.  The 2018 elections here returned 33 Lib Dem councillors, 18 Conservatives and 3 independents; the winning Lib Dem vote share was rather low (38%, against 35% for the Conservatives) and this could be an unpredictable council.  A rather large proportion of the Sutton Lib Dem group isn't seeking re-election this year, which may or may not be indicative of something.
</p><p>
<img alt="Kingston (Thames), 2018" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2018/kingston-thames18s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
There is also a large amount of councillor turnover in neighbouring <b>Kingston upon Thames</b> council, where any Lib Dem backslide could be embarrassing as most of this borough is the constituency of the party leader Sir Ed Davey.  For those who remember last year, when the Official Monster Raving Loony Party's deputy leader Jason "Chinners" Chinnery pulled a stunt worthy of the Turner Prize by getting 13 Loony candidates nominated at a single council by-election, I regret to report that the sequel - as often happens with sequels - hasn't quite lived up to those expectations.  The Loonies have nominated four candidates for three seats in the new ward of Chessington South and Malden Rushett.  It probably doesn't help that in this context that last year's special COVID rules, which temporarily reduced the number of signatures required for council election nominations in England from ten to two, have now expired.
</p><p>

</p><p>
Next to Sutton we have the disaster area of <b>Croydon</b> council, which went bust in a very public way during the 2018-22 term after going all-in on a town centre redevelopment which fell through.  Possibly as a reaction to this, a referendum in Croydon last October returned a very large vote in favour of converting the borough to the elected mayoral system.  The 2018 elections here returned 41 Labour councillors against 29 Conservatives, but for the mayoral election it will be more important to look at the votes cast, in which Labour had a slender lead over the Conservatives of 44-39.  The Labour lead was bigger in the 2019 general election, when Croydon's three constituencies voted 49% Labour and 38% Conservative.  However, it was a different story in the London mayor and assembly elections last year, held after the council ran out of money: Shaun Bailey led Sadiq Khan 42-36 across the borough, while Croydon voted 38% Conservative, 35% Labour and 11% Green in the London Members ballot for the Assembly.  Croydon is quite a polarised borough, so vote changes here tend to be low.
</p><p>
For the inaugural <b>Croydon mayoral election</b> the Labour candidate is Val Shawcross, a former leader of the council (1997-2000) who served from 2000 to 2016 as the London Assembly member for Lambeth and Southwark.  Shawcross was appointed CBE back in 2002 for services to local government.  The Conservatives have selected Jason Perry, who leads the Conservative group on the council and has been a Croydon councillor since 1994.  Also standing are Peter Underwood for the Green Party, Richard Howard for the Liberal Democrats, failed London mayoral candidate Farah London for the "Taking the Initiative Party", failed <em>Celebrity Big Brother</em> contestant and independent candidate Winston McKenzie who would appear to have finally run out of political parties who are prepared to have him as a member, ex-Conservative figure and independent candidate Gavin Palmer, and ex-Conservative MP, ex-Labour councillor and independent candidate Andrew Pelling.
</p><p>
<img alt="Lewisham, 2018" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2014/lewisham14s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
We finish our tour of London with the final mayoral election in the capital, which takes place in the south-eastern borough of <b>Lewisham</b>.  Labour won a clean sweep in Lewisham borough in 2018, carrying all 54 council seats and the mayoralty, and the party defended a parliamentary by-election in Lewisham East shortly afterwards without fuss.  Labour's Damian Egan won the mayoralty in the first round with 54% of the vote, against 13% for the Conservatives and 10% for the Green Party.
</p><p>
Egan is seeking a second term as Labour <b>Mayor of Lewisham</b>.  The Conservative candidate is Caroline Attfield, who comes to elected politics from a 35-year career in the financial sector.  The Greens have selected Nick Humberstone, who came a poor third in a by-election in Lewisham's Bellingham ward last year.  Also standing are Chris Maines for the Liberal Democrats, Andy Beadle for the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition, Maureen Martin for the Christian Peoples Alliance and independent candidate Roger Mighton.
</p><p>
<h2 id="wa">Wales</h2>
</p><p>
The whole of local government in Wales is up for election this year.  The Local Democracy and Boundary Commission have reviewed all 22 Welsh councils over the last five years and come up with a new set of ward boundaries for the entire country, so I warn you that comparisons with previous years may be rather difficult.  A boundary review was sorely needed in many areas, as some councils were still using the electoral arrangements they got when Welsh local government was reorganised back in the 1990s.  As in the London section above, the maps here show the old ward boundaries, not the new ones.
</p><p>
<img alt="Bridgend, 2017" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2017/bridgend17s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
The last Welsh local elections were held in May 2017, at which Labour lost control of three councils in the Valleys: Bridgend, Merthyr Tydfil and Blaenau Gwent.  In the case of <b>Bridgend</b> this was compounded for Labour by the loss of the Bridgend parliamentary seat to the Conservatives in 2019.  Labour continue to run Bridgend council as a minority; in 2017 they won 26 seats against 13 independents, 11 Conservatives, three Plaid Cymru councillors and a single Lib Dem.
</p><p>
<img alt="Blaenau Gwent, 2017" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2017/blgw17s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
<b>Merthyr Tydfil</b> council has an independent majority, with 18 independent councillors against 15 Labour.  <b>Blaenau Gwent</b> council (above), based on Ebbw Vale and Tredegar, saw a Labour bloodbath in 2017 with the party losing 20 seats: 28 independent councillors were returned five years ago against 13 Labour and 1 Plaid.  Council by-election results in the Valleys have generally been nothing to write home about for Labour over the last five years, but at a higher level the party did oust the former Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood in the Rhondda constituency at last year's Senedd election.  Labour are defending a large majority on the <b>Rhondda Cynon Taf</b> council, which covers that area.
</p><p>
<img alt="Vale of Glamorgan, 2017" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2017/vale-glamorgan17s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
One South Wales council to watch could be the <b>Vale of Glamorgan</b>.  The Conservatives finished one seat short of a majority here in 2017, winning 23 seats against 14 Labour, 6 independents and 4 Plaid; however, the local party has suffered a damaging split and there are only 14 councillors left in the Conservative group.  Which is rather embarrassing, given that one of those 14 is the Welsh Conservative leader Andrew R T Davies MS, who won a by-election in Rhoose in 2019.  Since then the Senedd has passed a bill which bans people from serving simultaneously as councillors and MSs; this ban on dual mandates came in from May 2021.  Davies was allowed to finish the last year of his term on Vale of Glamorgan council, but he is now standing down perforce.
</p><p>
Going into these elections the Vale is run by a coalition of Labour, the Conservative splinter group and the independent councillors for Llantwit Major.  The Vale of Glamorgan parliamentary seat, which covers most of the council area with the exception of Penarth, has voted Conservative at Westminster level since 2010 but re-elected its Labour MS Jane Hutt for a sixth term of office in last year's Senedd election.  Hutt has sat continuously for the area since the creation of the original Assembly in 1999.
</p><p>
As well as the ban on dual mandates, the Welsh government has made some other innovations in its electoral process over the last council term.  16- and 17-year-olds, and all foreign nationals resident in Wales, became eligible to vote in Senedd and Welsh local elections last year, and this will be the first ordinary Welsh council election in all Welsh residents who have reached the age of 16 can cast a vote.  Four councils - Blaenau Gwent, Bridgend, Caerphilly and Torfaen - are running pilot schemes in which a select number of polling stations will open for early voting.
</p><p>
<img alt="Cardiff, 2017" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2017/cardiff17s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
The last Senedd also passed a local government bill which, among other things, has given Welsh councils the power to convert their electoral system to proportional representation with effect from the 2027 local elections.  This column is sceptical that any councils will actually choose to do that following these elections, but if any places go for this change it might be somewhere like <b>Cardiff</b> following a messy result.  The current Cardiff council has a small Labour majority: the 2017 elections returned 40 Labour councillors, 20 Conservatives, 11 Lib Dems, 3 councillors for Plaid Cymru and an independent.  The Plaid councillors have all since walked out of the party and joined Propel, a nationalist party led by ex-Plaid MS and outgoing city councillor Neil McEvoy.  McEvoy saved his deposit in Cardiff West in last year's Senedd election; Propel polled just 2.2% across the South Wales Central region, but almost half of that vote total came out of Cardiff West so it's not impossible McEvoy could be re-elected in Fairwater ward under his new colours.  The remnants of Cardiff's Plaid branch are running a joint ticket with the Greens, under the branding "Common Good".  Labour have gone backwards here in by-elections during the last council term and they will need to work hard to avoid a hung council.
</p><p>
<img alt="Monmouthshire, 2017" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2017/monmouthshire17s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
The only Welsh council with a Conservative majority is <b>Monmouthshire</b>, where the 2017 elections returned 25 Conservative councillors, 10 Labour, 5 independents and 3 Lib Dems.  The Tories have work to do to hold this: there has been some infighting in the local Conservative group, and the Senedd Monmouth constituency (which covers almost the same area) swung to Labour in 2021 partly as a result of the outgoing Tory MS seeking re-election as an independent candidate.  He polled 3.6% and finished sixth out of 10 candidates, although that was a better placing than former MP and outgoing MS Mark Reckless who ended up in 7th for the Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party.  Reckless' wife Catriona Brown-Reckless, incidentally, is standing as a Conservative candidate for Cardiff council in these elections; she has local government experience as a former Medway councillor (<em>Andrew's Previews 2016</em>, page 254).
</p><p>
<img alt="Carms, 2017" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2017/carms17s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Rural Welsh councils tend to elect a lot of independent councillors, often without a contest, while Plaid Cymru also perform well in Welsh-speaking rural areas.  One of Plaid's major targets for this year will be <b>Carmarthenshire</b> council, where they finished just short of a majority in 2017: that year Plaid won 36 seats, Labour 22 (mostly in Llanelli and the Amman valley) and independents 16.  This council covers all of the Carmarthen East and Dinefwr constituency represented in the Senedd by Plaid's leader Adam Price.  Carmarthenshire is currently run by a Plaid Cymru-Independent coalition, as is <b>Ceredigion</b> where Plaid start slightly further from a majority: the 2017 results here were 20 seats for Plaid, 13 independents, 8 Lib Dems and a single Labour councillor (in Lampeter, of all places).  <b>Pembrokeshire</b> has a secure independent majority.
</p><p>
<img alt="Powys, 2017" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2017/powys17s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
The battle for Powys could be an interesting one.  This council fell hung in 2017 after a long-lasting independent majority fell apart under increasing competition from established parties.  The 2017 elections returned 30 independents, 20 Conservatives, 13 Lib Dems, 7 Labour, 2 Plaid Cymru and Wales' first-ever Green local councillor, who came through the middle of a close three-way contest in Llangors.  The Greens are not defending their seat.  In 2017 nominations had to be reopened in Yscir ward where no candidates stood, and the resulting by-election returned a Conservative who is included in the total above.  The Conservatives actually topped the poll across Powys with 34% of the vote, although this was a slightly false position because nine independent councillors were elected unopposed.  The Tory councillors are predominantly in Montgomeryshire, the Lib Dems in Breconshire and Radnorshire (a seat which the Conservatives have gained at both Westminster and Senedd level in the last three years), and Labour in Ystradgynalis and Brecon town.  A shoutout is due to the <em>Round Britain Quiz</em> team-member and former quizmate of your columnist Myfanwy Alexander, outgoing independent councillor for Banwy ward in Montgomeryshire; boundary changes have forced her into a stiff re-election battle against two other outgoing councillors, Plaid Cymru's Bryn Davies and independent Emyr Jones, for the new ward of Banwy, Llanfihangel and Llanwddyn.  Only one of them can win.
</p><p>
<img alt="Anglesey, 2017" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2017/anglesey17s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Turning to the north coast, the remaining Plaid Cymru target is the <b>Isle of Anglesey</b> where they were, again, just short of a majority in 2017.  The outgoing council has 14 Plaid councillors, 13 independents, 2 Labour and a Lib Dem; Plaid performed creditably in two by-elections here last year.  A Plaid-Independent coalition is in place.
</p><p>
<img alt="Gwynedd, 2017" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2017/gwynedd17s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
<b>Gwynedd</b> is the only council in Wales which currently has a Plaid Cymru majority, and that shouldn't change particularly given that 28 Gwynedd councillors have been elected without a contest - that's more unopposed returns in this year's local elections than there are in the whole of England and Scotland put together.  Not good for democracy.
</p><p>
<img alt="Conwy, 2017" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2017/conwy17s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
We do have a full set of contested elections for the neighbouring <b>Conwy</b> council, which combines the Costa Geriatrica of Conwy town, Llandudno, Colwyn Bay and Abergele with a large but sparsely-populated rural interior.  Conwy is a permanently hung council.  In previous elections this century the Conservatives were the largest party in 2008 and independents on the other three occasions; in 2017 21 independent councillors were elected, 16 Conservatives, 10 Plaid (mostly from the interior), 8 Labour and 4 Lib Dems.  An independent-Conservative alliance is in control.  In the Senedd elections last year both constituencies covering the area were held by the Conservatives, who achieved a decent swing from Plaid Cymru in Aberconwy while Clwyd West swung to Labour.
</p><p>
<img alt="Denbighshire, 2017" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2017/denbighshire17s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
<b>Denbighshire</b> council, which stretches south from Rhyl and Prestatyn all the way to Llangollen, is even more balanced.  The 2017 elections here returned 16 Conservatives, 13 Labour, 9 Plaid, 8 independents and a single Lib Dem.  An independent-led anti-Labour coalition is in place.  An MRP-based local elections poll from Electoral Calculus predicted that Labour could gain overall control here, which seems unrealistic; the Labour vote in Denbighshire is strongly concentrated in Rhyl, which isn't large enough to outvote the rest of the council.  Additionally, the Vale of Clwyd constituency (which covers most of the council area, including Rhyl) was the only Senedd constituency the Conservatives gained from Labour last year.
</p><p>
<img alt="Flintshire, 2017" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2017/flintshire17s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
That same poll may be on firmer ground in forecasting a Labour gain in Flintshire, where there is much more of a track record for the party.  Labour currently run Flintshire as a minority; they held majority control here until 2008, and their 2017 result (34 Labour councillors, 25 independents, 6 Conservatives and 5 Lib Dems) was only just short of a majority.  Labour held both Flintshire constituencies in the Senedd election last year; Alyn and Deeside was the only North Wales constituency to stick with Labour in the 2019 Westminster election, while the Conservative MP elected that year for Delyn has since been thrown out of the party for disgraceful behaviour; he managed to avoid a recall petition only on a technicality.
</p><p>
<img alt="Wrexham, 2017" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2017/wrexham17s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Our final Welsh council is <b>Wrexham</b>, one of those places which those who write pieces about the decline of Labour like to talk about.  The Wrexham constituency now has a Conservative MP but it was held by Labour in last year's Senedd elections with almost no swing.  The Wrexham council area covers a much larger area than the constituency, taking in areas like Ruabon, the English Maelor and the Ceiriog Valley which form the majority of the Clwyd South constituency.  Clwyd South has a larger Labour majority in Senedd elections than Wrexham does, but its local elections (outside the Ruabon area) are dominated by independent candidates.  Labour have never had a majority on Wrexham council this century, and in the 2017 elections independents won exactly half of the seats: 26, against 12 Labour, 9 Conservatives, 3 Plaid and 2 Lib Dems.  For Labour to become the largest party here (as they were in 2012) they need to take on the independents in Wrexham town and the surrounding ex-coalfield areas, and by-election results in the 2017-22 term don't give much indication of that happening.
</p><p>
<h2 id="sc">Scotland</h2>
</p><p>
Here's a dirty little secret I've not been telling you in this piece so far.  Nearly all council majorities in England and Wales are based on a minority of the actual votes cast.  This is not the case in Scotland, where the revolutionary idea of proportional representation is used for local elections meaning that minority votes result in the minority representation they deserve.  The 2022 Scottish local elections are the fourth ordinary polls since PR was introduced in 2007.
</p><p>
<img alt="Aberdeen, 2017" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2017/aberdeen17s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
The use of PR means that every Scottish council on the mainland is hung, after Labour lost their majorities in Glasgow and a number of other central belt councils in 2017.  Cross-party working is and will remain the order of the day, and a wide variety of coalitions and other arrangements are in effect across Scotland's 32 councils, generally of an anti-Conservative or anti-SNP nature.  This includes a Labour-Conservative coalition in <b>Aberdeen</b>, which got the entire Aberdeen Labour group suspended from the party for an arrangement which the national Labour leadership didn't like.
</p><p>
<img alt="Edinburgh, 2017" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2017/edinburgh17s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
The Scottish National Party lead Scotland's other three big cities.  They run <b>Glasgow</b> in coalition with the Greens and carried every Glasgow ward in 2017.  <b>Edinburgh</b> (above) has an SNP-Labour coalition, and the SNP rule alone in <b>Dundee</b> (below), where they are very close to a majority.  As you can see from these maps, Labour didn't top the poll in a single ward in any of these cities in 2017.
</p><p>
<img alt="Dundee, 2017" src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2017/dundee17s.svgz"  style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
The big winners from the May 2017 local elections in Scotland were the Conservatives, who doubled their vote share from 2012 and more than doubled their share of councillors to become the second-largest party in Scottish local government.  This mostly came at the expense of Labour, with the SNP standing still.  The good Tory performance was an early pointer of the major gains for the Scottish Conservatives at the 2017 general election five weeks later, although many of those gains have since gone back to the SNP at Westminster level.
</p><p>
Allan Faulds, the Scottish local elections pundit who runs the strongly-recommended <em>Ballot Box Scotland</em> blog, has commissioned his own poll of these local elections.  With fieldwork from 24th to 28th March, Survation found first preferences of 44% for the SNP, 23% for Labour and 18% for the Conservatives, which is a big improvement on 2017 for the SNP, a significant improvement for Labour and a big fall for the Conservatives and independent candidates.  Faulds has his own take on the poll (<a href="https://ballotbox.scot/local-survation-march-22">here</a>; he correctly points out that the independent figure of 1% in the poll is too low, given that independent candidates polled 10% of the first preferences in 2017 and have strong representation in the more rural parts of Scotland.
</p><p>
As with previous years, the Scottish local election votes will be counted by machine starting on Friday morning.  Votes at 16 apply in Scotland, and remember to number the candidates your ballot paper in order of preference.
</p><p>
<h2 id="ni">Northern Ireland</h2>
</p><p>
We finally come to what may well be the most consequential of all the elections taking place today: the seventh general election for the Northern Ireland Assembly since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998.  This is the first Stormont election in over five years, because the last election was a snap poll in March 2017 after the Northern Ireland government was brought down by the Renewable Heat Incentive scandal.
</p><p>
The 2017 Assembly election was the first not to return a Unionist majority.  Unionist parties won 40 of the 90 seats (28 for the Democratic Unionist Party, 10 from the Ulster Unionist Party, 1 from the Traditional Unionist Voice, and an independent), nationalist parties won 39 (27 for Sinn Féin and 12 for the Social Democratic and Labour Party), and 11 MLAs were returned from other parties (8 from the Alliance Party, 2 from the Greens, and a People Before Profit MLA who in practice is a Nationalist but does not describe himself as such).  Shortly afterwards the 2017 Westminster general election saw the Democratic Unionist Party win every Unionist seat and Sinn Féin (who do not turn up to Westminster) win every Nationalist seat, leaving the DUP with an effective monopoly on Northern Ireland's representation and holding the balance of power in a hung parliament.  With the May Westminster government losing all its leverage over the DUP to force them into forming a government with Sinn Féin, Stormont remained suspended until January 2020 when a new Northern Ireland Executive was finally formed.  Arlene Foster of the Democratic Unionist Party became First Minister with Sinn Féin's Michelle O'Neill as Deputy First Minister.
</p><p>
Foster resigned as DUP leader in 2021 resulting in a chaotic series of leadership changes within the party.  Paul Givan eventually succeeded Foster as First Minister, before collapsing the Executive in February in opposition to the Northern Ireland Protocol to the Brexit agreement.  The Protocol, agreed by the British government ahead of Brexit in January 2020, means that Northern Ireland remains part of the EU customs union without border controls with the Republic of Ireland; the consequence of this is a customs border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  The Democratic Unionist Party will be led into the 2022 election not by Givan but by Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, who is not currently a member of the Assembly: he sits in Westminster as the MP for Lagan Valley.  A recent change to the rules means that Sir Jeffrey will not have to vacate his Westminster seat if he is elected to Stormont.
</p><p>
Northern Ireland is a difficult place to poll well, but two companies have tried their hands at political polling here over the last year: Lucid Talk run a regular poll series for the <em>Belfast Telegraph</em>, while Social Market Research have performed three polls over the last year for the University of Liverpool and the <em>Irish News</em>.  All polls since October 2020 have shown Sinn Féin as the largest party, often with a sizeable lead, with the DUP significantly down on the 28% they polled in March 2017 as they lose ground to other Unionist parties.  This would suggest that Michelle O'Neill is on track to become the first Nationalist First Minister, with Sir Jeffrey as her deputy if he fancies that.
</p><p>
There is no by-election evidence to confirm or refute this polling, because vacancies in the Assembly and on Northern Ireland's local councils are filled by a co-option system without going back to the voters.  The last local elections in the six counties were in early May 2019, with Sinn Féin breaking even and the DUP, UUP and SDLP losing ground; the main gainers were the Alliance Party.  Alliance then had their best-ever result at the last European Parliament elections three weeks later, placing third on first preferences and winning a seat at the expense of the UUP.  The polling evidence suggests that these gains for the Alliance are not a blip.
</p><p>
The last elections of any sort in Northern Ireland were the Westminster elections of December 2019, at which the Democratic Unionist Party lost two seats: Belfast North to Sinn Féin and Belfast South to the SDLP.  The SDLP also recovered the Foyle constituency which they had lost to Sinn Féin two years earlier, while the idiosyncratic North Down seat transferred its allegiance from an independent Unionist to the Alliance Party.  The DUP benefited from a number of Unionist pacts in December 2019, notably the absence of the hardline Traditional Unionist Voice party, so their vote share in December 2019 (31%) is not comparable with the Assembly polling.
</p><p>
The Assembly uses the same electoral boundaries as the 18 Westminster constituencies, with each constituency returning five MLAs by proportional representation.  Counting will start on Friday morning.  Remember to number the candidates your ballot paper in order of preference.

Before wrapping up this preview, it's time for us to pause and remember those elected representatives who passed away during the municipal year 2021-22.  The toll of the Grim Reaper falls indiscriminately on young and old, local government veterans and neophytes, councillors of all parties and none.  This column has told the stories of many of these dedicated public servants over the last twelve months: but there were some councillors whose seats were left vacant after their deaths without a by-election, and they are listed here.  Rest in peace.

<h2>Concluding remarks</h2>
</p><p>
The Britain Elects team will, as usual, be working their socks off to bring you cold hard ward-by-ward results as they come in from the counts on Thursday night and all through Friday.  If you liked the interactive map from last year, it's coming back; watch the Britain Elects Twitter for links.  Be prepared for shocks.  If there's anything I've learned from all these years following local elections, it's that there is always one result which makes my jaw drop when I see it come in.
</p><p>
Those results will be the result of a lot of hard work by 200 Returning Officers and their poll and count staff, who do a thankless job that doesn't just last for one day a year.  There is a fantastic amount of behind-the-scenes work that's needed to put this show on for your benefit: polling day is just the tip of the administrative iceberg, representing the culmination of months of planning.  Your council election teams have no margin for error: it all has to go right, every single time.  This column sends its best wishes to everybody working on this election for a smooth and trouble-free poll and count.
</p><p>
In terms of the counting itself, we will have more overnight results than last year but many councils, including every district in Wales and Scotland, have decided to stick with Friday counts.  The Press Association have published their usual list of estimated declaration times <a href="https://election.pressassociation.com/locals/provisional-may-election-declaration-times-in-chronological-order/">(link)</a>, although anybody who has followed counts should know that this sort of thing is often little more than guesswork.  Nonetheless, those who want to stay up late on Thursday night will need to pace themselves for the long day of result-following on Friday ahead.
</p><p>
Shoutouts are also due to the 21,070 candidates across England, Scotland and Wales in this most brutal form of job application.  No, I am not listing you all individually; but your local candidates can be found by entering your postcode into <a href="https://whocanivotefor.co.uk/">whocanivotefor.co.uk</a>.  For the winners, perhaps: the chance to do something about those potholes rather than point glumly at them, the chance to improve their local community.  For the losers: well, nobody remembers who comes second, with the exception of this column.  2022 is the 20th anniversary year for your columnist's other electoral hobby, the <a href="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/leap/">Local Elections Archive Project</a>, which will eventually get around to recording your result for posterity.
</p><p>
But the most important people in today's festival of democracy are you, the voters.  We have all seen in the news that there are parts of the world where democracy is not free, not fair or not existent; we have all seen in the news that there are parts of this continent where democracy is under threat.  In Ukraine, local government is literally on the frontline.  Democracy will only last for as long as there are people prepared to support it, prepared to participate in it, prepared to defend it, prepared to fight for it.  The best way you can defend Britain's local democracy is to take part in it.  Your vote will be free, it will be fair, it will be secret, and it will count in the same way as my vote and everybody else's vote.  But if you don't vote, your voice won't be heard when the ballot papers tumble out of the box onto the counting table, to decide your councillors' future - and yours.  If you have a postal vote you should have received it by now; if you intend to vote at a polling station, don't forget to go there between 7am and 10pm on Thursday.  You will be most welcome.  You can find your designated polling station on your polling card, or by going to <a href="https://wherecanivote.co.uk/">wherecanivote.co.uk</a>.
</p><p>
This column doesn't just come out at election time; Andrew's Previews is here for you all year round.  Next week we resume normal service by covering two local by-elections in Surrey and Sussex.  Stay tuned.
