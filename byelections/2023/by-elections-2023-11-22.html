One by-election on Wednesday 22nd November 2023:
</p><p>
<h2>Talybont-on-Usk</h2>
</p><p>
Powys council, Mid and West Wales; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Anita Cartwright.
</p><p>
Over the last few weeks Andrew's Previews has taken a tour of mid-Wales.  Two weeks ago we were in the Usk valley for a double by-election to Powys council; last week we saw Plaid Cymru hold a Ceredigion council seat in Aberystwyth.  Now, for the final part of this particular trilogy it's back to the Usk valley.
</p><p>

</p><p>
We've come a little further up the valley from Crickhowell, the venue for the last Powys by-election, to reach Talybont-on-Usk.  This is a village of just over 700 souls which lies on the River Usk and on the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal, which opened as far as here in 1799.  It is the eastern of the three communities which make up Talybont-on-Usk ward, which also takes in Llanfrynach not far to the east of Brecon.  The third community within the ward is Glyn Tarell, a valley running south-west from Brecon through which the main road towards Merthyr Tydfil and Cardiff runs.
</p><p>
The economy of this area is based on the surrounding mountains - whether in the form of hill-farming, quarrying or tourism.  Almost all of Talybont-on-Usk ward is within the Bannau Brycheiniog or Brecon Beacons national park, and the ward is centred on the park's highest point.  This is Pen y Fan, whose summit altitude of 886 metres makes it the highest point in the UK south of Snowdonia.  The mountainous terrain here is a test not just for hikers but also for the special forces, who have a base in the Brecon area and use Pen y Fan for selection purposes.  If, within 20 hours, you can march 40 miles with a full pack before ascending and descending Pen y Fan, then maybe you're good enough for the SAS.
</p><p>
On a good day those who reach the summit of Pen y Fan might be rewarded with views of 70 miles or more: north to Cadair Idris and (just about) the Carneddau, south to Exmoor and Lundy Island.  But this doesn't always happen.  Sometimes it never stops raining.  Which is good news for the water board: some of that rain is collected within this ward in the Talybont and Pontsticill Reservoirs, which supply water to Newport and the Valleys respectively.  Next to the latter reservoir is one of the Great Little Trains of Wales: the narrow-gauge Brecon Mountain Railway, along which tourists can commute into the National Park from the south.
</p><p>
Talybont-on-Usk has been a single-member ward of Powys council since 1999.  In 2008 independent councillor Dorothy James stood down after 35 years' service and her seat was gained by Liam Fitzpatrick, who was originally elected on the Liberal Democrat ticket but then went independent for the 2012 and 2017 elections.  Fitzpatrick stood down last year, and the 2022 Powys elections produced a very close four-way result: his seat went to the Lib Dems' Anita Cartwright, who finished in first place with just 28% of the vote.  Second place went to independent candidate Glasnant Morgan, who polled 25%; the Conservatives had 24% and independent candidate Charles de Winton finished fourth and last with 23%.  All four candidates were separated by just 41 votes, with Cartwright's majority being 19.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, Anita Cartwright has been in poor health since her election: she was granted leave of absence from the council in May 2023, before submitting her resignation in October.  Her resignation statement indicated that, following her experience of cancer, she now wanted to enjoy family life with her young children and pursue her lifelong dream of farming.
</p><p>
In the meantime, there has a major political row in Talybont over the fate of Gilestone Farm.  This farm was recently bought by the Welsh Government with a view to its being leased to the people behind the Green Man music and arts festival, which takes place every summer at Glanusk a little way down the Usk valley from here.  Green Man aren't looking to move their festival out of Glanusk; instead they have plans to diversify, with some smaller events and business ventures planned for Gilestone Farm.  Opponents of the Green Man plan have essentially taken over Talybont-on-Usk community council.  Powys council is run by a Lib Dem-Labour coalition which has been generally supportive of the Green Man plans, so this by-election could be an interesting test of local public opinion.
</p><p>
As mentioned a couple of weeks ago, this ward is within the Brecon and Radnor parliamentary seat which is held by the Conservatives at both Westminster and Senedd level.  Both of those Conservative seats were recent gains from the Liberal Democrats, in the case of the Westminster seat reversing a by-election loss in August 2019.  The Westminster boundary changes redraw this constituency as "Brecon, Radnor and Cwm Tawe", which might make Labour competitive across the seat; but Labour's Breconshire vote is concentrated in Brecon town and Ystradgynlais, and the party is not a factor in this by-election.
</p><p>
Defending for the Liberal Democrats is Raiff Devlin, a young farmer from Brecon: last year he contested the neighbouring ward of Yscir with Honddu Isaf and Llanddew.  His main challenge might well come from independent candidate Liam Fitzpatrick, who as noted above was a councillor for this ward from 2008 to 2022; Fitzpatrick sat in the Powys council cabinet for a time after the 2017 elections before setting up his own independent group.  Another independent candidate on the ballot is David Markinson, who will be hoping for better than the 18 votes he polled in Crickhowell with Cwmdu and Tretower thirteen days ago.  One of the two independent candidates who contested this ward in 2022, chartered surveyor Charles de Winton (who finished fourth), is back for another go; but this time, de Winton has the Conservative nomination.  He completes a ballot paper of four candidates.
