"All the right votes, but not necessarily in the right order"

</p><p>
Two polls on 12th January 2023:
</p><p>
<h2>Moor View; and<br>
Plympton Chaddlewood</h2>
</p><p>
Plymouth council, Devon; caused respectively by the resignations of Conservative councillors Shannon Burden and Dan Collins.
</p><p>
Our two by-elections today take place on the outskirts of the largest city in Devon.  Located on the east bank of the Tamar estuary, Plymouth has been a major port for centuries for both commercial and military traffic: Devonport Dockyard is the largest naval base in western Europe, while regular ferries connect the city's shoreline with Roscoff in Brittany, Santander in Spain and Torpoint in Cornwall.
</p><p>
Devonport itself was once a separate town from Plymouth, and in 1837 it became the very first new borough to be incorporated under the first major local government reform measure, the Municipal Corporations Act 1835.  The town had already been enfranchised as a parliamentary borough three years earlier by the First Reform Act, and from 1832 to 2010 there was always a constituency called Devonport or Plymouth Devonport.  This seat has had a number of famous MPs, starting appropriately enough with a naval figure.  Admiral Sir Edward Codrington, who was a Whig MP for Devonport from 1832 to 1840, had fought at Trafalgar and was the winning commander against the Ottoman fleet at the 1827 Battle of Navarino.  He also owned slaves in Antigua, which makes Codrington a bit of a controversial figure these days; when his slaves were freed in 1835 under the terms of the Slavery Abolition Act, Codrington received over Â£2,500 in government compensation.
</p><p>
Sir Edward Codrington resigned from the Commons in 1840.  Now, one does not simply resign as an MP: instead you have to be appointed to an Office of Profit under the Crown which exists for the sole purpose of vacating your parliamentary seat.  There are two such offices of profit in use today, the Chiltern Hundreds and the Manor of Northstead; but other similar offices have been used in the past.  Codrington was the last MP to resign by being appointed as Steward of the Manor of East Hendred, and that resignation went through despite the fact that the Crown had actually sold that manor in 1823.  It seems that nobody had told the Parliamentary authorities about this at the time, and at least seventeen appointments were made to the Manor of East Hendred before the penny dropped.  Codrington died in 1851, and the post of Steward of the Manor of East Hendred has been vacant ever since.
</p><p>
Other former MPs for Plymouth Devonport include the 1930s transport minister Leslie Hore-Belisha, whose name is still commemorated by the zebra crossing "Belisha beacons" on our streets; the future Labour leader Michael Foot; and the SDP leader David Owen.  The current MP for the area is the Conservatives' Johnny Mercer, a former Army officer who did multiple tours of Afghanistan; for some years now (with a break during the Truss administration) he has been a junior minister with responsibility for veterans' affairs.
</p><p>
However, Mercer doesn't represent a seat called Devonport.  Boundary changes for the 2010 election transferred Devonport itself into the other Plymouth constituency, Sutton, meaning that the former Devonport seat needed a new name; "Moor View" was chosen.  This refers to the Moor View ward, which lies on the north-east corner of Plymouth.  The River Plym is that ward's eastern boundary, while the ward extends west to the Tavistock Road; this means it takes in the site of the mothballed Plymouth Airport together with Derriford Hospital, the major general hospital for Plymouth and the surrounding area.  The rather isolated council estate of Estover is the main residential area of the ward.
</p><p>
The 1832 Reform Act gave representation to Devonport but took the MPs away from Plympton Erle, one of the notorious rotten boroughs of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries; in its last century of existence Plympton Erle had only one contested election, in 1802, with the two winning candidates polling twelve votes each.  Back in the day the tin trade formed a major part of Plympton's economy, and Plympton was the first major port in this area: the boats only transferred downstream to Plymouth once the Plym estuary started to silt up, many centuries ago.  The town wasn't incorporated into Plymouth until 1967, and it's still rather semi-detached from the city: since 1997 it has formed part of the South West Devon parliamentary seat.
</p><p>
Chaddlewood is the eastern of Plympton's three wards and is one of three Plymouth wards which are undersized, returning just two councillors rather than the usual three.  In the 2011 census it made the top 25 wards in England and Wales for people educated to "Level 2", which means 5+ GCSE passes or equivalent but no higher qualifications.
</p><p>
Plymouth city council elections are often closely-fought contests between the Conservative and Labour parties, and periods of control for either party tend to be short-lived.  Since the city gained unitary status in 1997, there have been five separate periods of Labour majority and four separate periods of Conservative majority.
</p><p>
We should be in a Conservative-majority period at the moment, but for some years now the Plymouth Conservatives have been in a state of civil war which makes the Republican group in the US House of Representatives look coherent and united.  Since October four Plymouth Conservative councillors have left or been suspended from the party and two more have resigned altogether: that's left the council hung.  The latest composition gives 24 Conservative councillors plus two vacancies, 24 Labour, five ex-Conservative independents and two Greens.  The title of Plymouth's largest party is on the line in these by-elections.
</p><p>
The electoral history of Moor View ward rather mirrors that of Plymouth as a whole.  In the twenty years since the current boundaries came in, the Conservatives and Labour have each won seven elections here, with the UK Independence Party also topping the poll in 2014.  The UKIP councillor, Maddi Bridgman, was subsequently re-elected in 2018 and May 2022 with the Conservative nomination, but she was them suspended from the party in November 2022.  Moor View has clearly swung to the right in recent years and has had a full slate of Conservative councillors since 2021; the May 2022 election here had a Conservative lead of 54-38, so Labour have some work to do if they want to win this seat back.
</p><p>
Over the same period Plympton Chaddlewood ward has normally been a safe Conservative area, but that suddenly changed in 2021 when the Green Party contested the ward for the first time.  From literally nowhere the Greens came very close to winning, and they then built on that performance to gain Chaddlewood ward from the Conservatives in May 2022 with a large majority: 58% for the Green Party, 35% for the Conservatives.
</p><p>
The Tories will have to defend both of today's by-elections following the resignations of Moor View councillor Shannon Burden and Plympton Chaddlewood councillor Dan Collins.  Both of them were first elected to the council in 2021, with Burden gaining her seat from Labour.  Burden and Collins, who are in a relationship, have since left the city and now live and work in Gloucester.  This caused some controversy locally.  Their positions became untenable when November's full council meeting passed a motion calling for their resignations by 31 votes to nil, with most of the Conservative group abstaining.
</p><p>
Both of the resulting by-elections have attracted a lot of interest with six candidates standing for each vacancy.  In Moor View the defending Conservative candidate is Andrea Johnson, who was previously a Plymouth councillor for Compton ward in 2018-22; she didn't seek re-election last May, and her former ward was gained by Labour.  The Labour candidate is Will Noble, who works as a cleaner at Derriford Hospital.  Also standing are Colin Mackenzie for the Lib Dems, Frank Hartkopf for the Green Party, Andrew White for the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition and independent candidate Gavin Marshall.
</p><p>
We have the same party lineup in Plympton Chaddlewod.  The difficult task of holding that ward for the Conservatives has fallen to Ashley Ward, who runs an electrical services company.  He is likely to face a strong challenge from the Greens' Lauren McLay, who describes herself as a local communications specialist.  The other candidates for Chaddlewood are Lindsay Gilmour for Labour, Benjamin Davy of the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition, Mike Gillbard of the Lib Dems and independent candidate Andrew Hill.

Before this column leaves Plymouth, a shoutout is due to Colin Rallings and Michael Thrasher of the Local Government Elections Centre, who for many years have been professors of politics at Plymouth University.  The study of British local elections owes an immeasurable debt to Rallings and Thrasher, who have collected and analysed local election results from this country for decades.  Their dataset is second to none with over 900,000 candidacies - three times the size of my Local Elections Archive Project - and I do refer to it quite a lot on the occasions when I need to consult results from before my records start in 2002.  Michael Thrasher has generously described this column in my hearing with the words "wonderful reports", and I'd like to return the favour by putting on the record here my thanks to Rallings and Thrasher for their decades of hard work.  I look forward to hearing their insights and analysis for many years to come.
