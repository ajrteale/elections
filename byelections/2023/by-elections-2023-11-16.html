<h2>Aberystwyth Penparcau</h2>

Ceredigion council, Mid and West Wales; caused by the resignation of Plaid Cymru councillor Steve Davies.

For our Welsh by-election this week we have come to Penparcau.  This is a large village which effectively functions as a suburb of Aberystwyth; it is located to the south-east of the town centre, between the two rivers which flow into Cardigan Bay at Aberystwyth - not just the Ystwyth as you'd expect from the town's name, but also the Rheidol.  All traffic entering Aberystwyth from the south will pass through Penparcau before entering the toen centre.

Aberystwyth is the largest town in the Welsh county of Ceredigion, a generally rural and strongly Welsh-speaking area.  This is fertile territory for the Welsh nationalist party Plaid Cymru, who hold the Ceredigion seat at both Westminster and Senedd levels; Elin Jones MS has represented the area continuously since the creation of the original Welsh Assembly in 1999 and is currently the Llywydd, or presiding officer, of the Senedd.  Ben Lake has been the Plaid MP for Ceredigion since 2017, when he gained the seat from the Liberal Democrats; his seat will be expanded into northern Pembrokeshire for the next general election, with the new name of Ceredigion Preseli.

The local authority here is Ceredigion council, which has a small majority for Plaid Cymru - currently 20 out of 38 seats plus this vacancy.  Plaid have held at least one of the two seats in Aberystwyth Penparcau ward since 2008, and the Plaid slate won both seats in 2012 and 2022 - on the latter occasion defeating former Lib Dem councillor Glyndwr Edwards, who unsuccesfully sought re-election as an independent.  The headline shares of the vote here last year were 47% for the Plaid Cymru slate, 28% for Labour and 14% for Edwards.

The outgoing Plaid Cymru councillor Steve Davies had represented this ward since 2012 and had also served as Mayor of Aberystwyth.  Despite that, in 2022 he scraped re-election by the skin of his teeth, winning the second seat with a majority of just 30 votes over Labour and polling far below his running mate.  This suggests that Davies' personal vote was either negligible or negative, which is pretty unusual for a sitting councillor.

Well, Steve Davies has been in trouble for some time: a number of complaints have been made about his conduct since 2020.  Davies was suspended from Plaid Cymru in January, and in July the Public Service Ombudsman for Wales suspended his membership of both Ceredigion council and Aberystwyth town council, pending a full investigation into alleged incidents of inappropriate behaviour towards a number of women.  Aberystwyth Town FC have reportedly banned him from their social club.  Davies eventually resigned his seat in October, telling the local press he had been advised to do so by Ceredigion council's legal department; one suspects he was about to be disqualified under the six-month non-attendance rule.

So we have a by-election.  Defending the seat for Plaid Cymru is Shelley Childs, who is heavily involved with Aberystwyth's cycling community; his day job is selling bicycle tyres.  Labour have reselected their runner-up candidate from last time Alex Mangold; he is a German lecturer at Aberystwyth University.  S4C football commentator Tomi Morgan is standing as an independent candidate: he is a former striker and manager with Aberystwyth Town who now coaches Penparcau FC, and last year he came out of retirement and scored a hat-trick for Penparcau - at the age of 65.  Also standing are Bryony Davies for the Lib Dems and Ewan Lawry for the Conservatives.

<h2>Rossington and Bawtry</h2>

Doncaster council, South Yorkshire; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Barry Johnson.

Back to the North Country for this week's Labour defence.  We've come east of the Pennines to reach a mining centre of rather recent vintsge.  New Rossington is a village just to the south of Doncaster, which was called into existence in the 20th century to house workers at Rossington Main Colliery when it was sunk in the 1910s.  Rossington Main was one of the UK's last deep pits, finally closing in 2007 although coal volumes in its final years were much reduced from the colliery's heyday; the pithead site has now been redeveloped for housing.

New Rossington and its older twin village of Rossington lie either side of the East Coast Main Line just to the south of Doncaster, but there is no station here.  Neither is there a station at Bawtry, an old market town which used to straddle the Yorkshire-Nottinghamshire border: this was once a Roman settlement on Ermine Street, then it became an inland port on the River Idle, while Bawtry's location on the Great North Road means that the town centre has a fair number of old coaching inns.

Although the rivers draining this area are the Idle (at Bawtry) and the Torne (at Rossington), we are in a parliamentary seat named after a different river: the Yorkshire Don.  Don Valley was one of the constituencies in the canonical Red Wall, and it voted Conservative in December 2019 for the first time in its history; former Labour Cabinet minister Caroline Flint lost her seat to Bawtry resident Nick Fletcher MP.  Fletcher's seat will be heavily redrawn for the next election as "Doncaster East and the Isle of Axholme", which should give him a better chance of re-election: the Isle of Axholme is rural Lincolnshire territory which would be expected to vote heavily Conservative.

The Conservatives are, however, very weak in Rossington and Bawtry ward which tends to vote heavily for Labour or independent candidates, although UKIP did win one of the three seats here in 2015.  Doncaster council has a non-standard electoral cycle, holding elections for the mayor and council in county council election years; accordingly the most recent local elections here were in 2021, when the Labour slate polled 46% of the vote against 26% for a long-serving independent councillor (who lost his seat) and 20% for the Conservatives.  The elected mayor of Doncaster is Labour's Ros Jones, and Labour have a majority of Doncaster councillors to go with that.

This by-election is defended by Labour following the retirement of Barry Johnson, who was first elected for the former Rossington ward in 2006, retired in 2014 and returned in 2021.  Johnson was also a long-serving member of Rossington parish council, and the archives of the Election Court feature a case which he brought regarding the 1999 parish council election in Rossington West ward.  The Court found that there had been a counting error, overturned the result and declared that Barry Johnson had been duly elected.

Defending for Labour is Ken Guest, a former miner who is the chair of Rossington parish council.  Rossington parish councillor and taxi driver John Cooke, the independent councillor who lost his seat in 2021, is seeking to return.  The Conservatives have selected Carol Greenhalgh, who works in research alongside teaching music and volunteering as a Cub Scout leader.  Completing the ballot paper is Reform UK's Surjit Singh Duhre.

<h2>Motherwell South East and Ravenscraig</h2>

North Lanarkshire council, Scotland; caused by the resignation of Scottish National Party councillor Agnes Magowan.

It's now time to start winding down the electoral year.  We are now out of time for new by-elections to be scheduled before Christmas, so today's poll in Scotland will be the last Scottish electoral event of 2023.

You can't talk about Motherwell for long without mentioning the metal that made the town what it is today.  For a century this was Scotland's premier steelworking town, its economy and landscape dominated by the Dalzell steelworks founded in 1872 by David Colville and Sons.  By 1914 Colville's works were the UK's largest single steelworks.

In the 1950s Colville's, with government subsidy, opened the massive Ravenscraig steelworks which essentially filled an enormous space to the east of Motherwell town centre.  But by the 1980s Ravenscraig was in decline; it posseesed western Europe's largest hot strip steel mill, but the loss of important local customers and industrial unrest had taken their toll.  The steelworks closed in 1992 with the loss of 770 jobs, and were demolished soon afterwards.

Where Ravenscraig once stood is now one of Europe's largest brownfield sites.  There are grand plans for regeneration, and some houses have been built together with the striking Regional Sports Facility, an impressive leisure centre which opened in 2010.  But Ravenscraig New Town is very much a work in progress, and there is plenty of space for more developments yet.

In the meantime, Ravenscraig is part of an electoral ward which runs from Motherwell town centre along the road to Wishaw, almost as far as Wishaw town centre.  This ward was drawn up in 2007 and modified in 2017, and returns four members of North Lanarkshire council by proportional representation.

The initial 2007 election here was an oddity.  The SNP polled enough votes to win two seats, but only had one candidate; the beneficiaries of this, in a result which can only be described as bizarre, were the Conservatives.  Even more bizarrely, the Conservative candidate Linsey McKay won her seat in the final round of counting, overtaking the third Labour candidate on transfers when the Scottish Socialist Party was eliminated.  It was the only seat the Conservatives won on North Lanarkshire council that year, and there was some ironic press comment at the time that this win came in Ravenscraig of all places.

The Conservatives lost this rather flukish seat to Labour in 2012, but got it back in 2017; Labour in fact lost two seats that year, one to the Conservatives and the other to the SNP who took over first place in the ward.  The 2022 Scottish council elections here gave 43% of the first preferences to the SNP, 31% to Labour and 17% to the Conservatives, with the seat count remaining at 2 SNP, 1 Labour and 1 Conservative.

Overall the 2022 North Lanarkshire council elections were good for the SNP, who finished in first place on the council with 36 seats; Labour won 32, the Conservatives 5, independent candidates 2, and one each for the Greens and the British Unionist Party - who, despite the name, are effectively a localist party for the Shotta area.  The SNP's Jordan Linden became the first Nationalist leader of the council at the age of just 27, but was then forced to resign almost immediately over sexual harassment claims.  This led to a major split in the SNP group, and Labour are now back running the council again as a minority administration.  Linden resigned from the council earlier this year, and the resulting by-election in Bellshill ward last June was an impressive Labour gain.

That Bellshill by-election was the first electoral event in Scotland since Humza Yousaf took over as First Minister from Nicola Sturgeon.  The SNP are still looking for their first by-election win of the Yousaf era.  They do represent this area at both Westminster and Holyrood as part of the Motherwell and Wishaw constituency; the Westminster seat will be redrawn from the next election with the new name of "Motherwell, Wishaw and Carluke".

And the SNP have to defend this by-election following the resignation of councillor Agnes Magowan for family health reasons; Magowan had represented the ward since 2017, and topped the poll at both the 2017 and 2022 elections.  On paper, this should be the easiest SNP defence of the Yousaf era so far; as stated the party led Labour 43-31 on first preferences in 2022, and Allan Faulds of <em>Ballot Box Scotland</em> (<a href="https://ballotbox.scot/preview-mser/">link to his preview</a>) has crunched the numbers and found a 55-45 lead for the SNP on a two-party preferred basis.

Defending for the Scottish National Party is Rosa Zambonini, whom readers with long memories might recall has appeared in this column before: she won a by-election to the neighbouring Wishaw ward in August 2015, holding the seat which had been vacated by SNP councillor Marion Fellows after her election as MP for Motherwell and Wishaw.  Zambonini stood down from the council in 2017 but is now seeking to return.  That description also fits the Labour candidate Kaye Harmon, who was a councillor for this ward from 2007 to 2017 and topped the poll here in the 2012 election.  The Conservative candidate is Oyebola Ajala, who is a financial services professional.  Also standing are Derek Watson for the Scottish Green Party, Neil Wilson for UKIP (who finished seventh and last here in 2022), Billy Acheson for the British Unionist Party, Robert McGeorge for the Liberal Democrats and Mark Shields for Alba.
