"All the right votes, but not necessarily in the right order"

</p><p>
We start the new municipal year with one by-election on Wednesday 17th May 2023:
</p><p>
<h2>Painswick and Upton</h2>
</p><p>
Stroud council, Gloucestershire; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Jason Bullingham.

</p><p>
So, the local elections in Great Britain are over for another year.  For the Conservatives, the results this year will probably be ones they would like to forget; for the other three main parties of English local government, there were major gains in councils and councillors.
</p><p>
I say "three" in that last sentence because of the rise of the Green Party, who are now clearly a force to be reckoned with in English local government.  The Greens now have majority control of a principal council, Mid Suffolk; they made major gains in councils all over England this year, and they are likely to lead a number of other administrations once the dust settles in councils where there is no overall majority.
</p><p>
In that context, it's a shame that the BBC's Projected National Share estimates for this year's local elections only broke out votes for Labour, the Conservatives and the Lib Dems.  Green voters got lumped in with votes for independent councillors and minor parties, which seems like a missed opportunity.  Hopefully the BBC's local election team can sort this out in time for the May 2024 local elections.
</p><p>
Before the local elections two weeks ago there were three English councils with Green leaders: Brighton and Hove, Lancaster and Stroud.  Of those, Brighton and Hove now has a Labour majority, while Lancaster remains hung and negotiations for a new council administration might take some time to conclude.  That leaves Stroud, which wasn't part of the local elections this year; Stroud council has a non-standard electoral cycle, and its next ordinary local elections are not due until next year.
</p><p>

</p><p>
Stroud has been a hung council for some years now.  The Conservatives are the largest party on the council, winning 20 seats at the last elections in 2021; Labour won 15 seats then, the Greens 13 and the Lib Dems 3.
</p><p>
Despite their first place on the council, the Tories have been shut out of power here since 2012 by some form of left-wing administration.  This was led by Labour until the local party fell apart last year, amid a row over the then leader of the council, Doina Cornell, not being shortlisted in the selection for the next Labour parliamentary candidate for Stroud.  There are just six official Labour councillors left here now, and the rump Labour group has gone into opposition.  The Greens' leader Catherine Braun now presides over a coalition administration of the Greens and two Labour splinter groups.
</p><p>
In many ways it's fitting that the Greens are running Stroud council, given that this is the district with the longest continuous history of Green involvement in local government.  When he retired two years ago Stroud councillor John Marjoram had been a Green councillor for 35 unbroken years, originally being elected in May 1986 - when the Greens were still called the Ecology Party.
</p><p>
The Stroud district isn't just the town itself; it takes in a number of smaller towns, many of which are or have been rather industrial in nature, and a fair amount of countryside in the rolling Cotswold hills - the so-called Five Valleys, which converge at Stroud town.  One of the five is the Slad Valley, which has been immortalised in literature thanks to local lad Laurie Lee, who described his childhood here in the perennially-popular 1959 book <em>Cider with Rosie</em>.  Lee made enough money out of that book that he was able to move back to the village of Slad, where he now lies in eternal rest.
</p><p>
Slad is covered by the parish of Painswick, a small town which overlooks another of the Five Valleys.  Painswick can be found on the main road between Stroud and Cheltenham, and it grew thanks to the wool industry which dominated this corner of the Cotswolds in mediaeval times.  Until its closure earlier this year, the town's post office was housed in a half-timbered building which dated from the fifteenth century.
</p><p>
We are firmly within the Cotswold Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty here, and Painswick's setting has been attractive to figures ranging from King Charles I (the nearly hamlet of "Paradise" is said to be named for an exclamation by him when he saw the area) to a number of 20th-century composers.  Gerald Finzi and the musical composer Julian Slade both spent time in Painswick, but for our musical interlude I'll highlight C W Orr, who lived here for most of his life.  Most of Orr's musical work was settings of poetry or song, but he also wrote this piece for strings in 1937 with the title <em>Cotswold Hill-Tune</em>.

</p><p>
Painswick and Upton ward takes in a lot of Cotswold hill landscape, all the way up to the edge of Gloucester.  Here we can find the village of Upton St Leonards, which is essentially an extension of Gloucester's built-up area but is cut off from the rest of the city by the M5 motorway.
</p><p>
Given the easy links to both Gloucester and Stroud for various parts of this ward, it shouldn't come as much of a surprise that this ward has a bit of an educated commuter profile or that it votes Conservative in local elections.  But it's not a safe Conservative ward.  In 2021, the last year this ward was contested, the Tories won here with 42% of the vote against 34% for the Green Party and 24% for Labour.  On the same day the Tories had a similar lead over the Greens in the local division of Gloucestershire county council (Bisley and Painswick).  2021 was an exceptionally good Conservative year; given the national swing, the sort of results we saw two weeks ago and this ward's presence in a marginal parliamentary seat (Stroud), the local Conservatives must be looking at this by-election with some concern.
</p><p>
The unusual Wednesday scheduling of this by-election will enable the winning candidate to hit the ground running and start their council career straight away at Stroud council's AGM on Thursday evening.  The winner will replace Conservative councillor Jason Bullingham, who stood down last month on health grounds.  He had served since 2021.
</p><p>
Defending this by-election for the Conservatives is Sue Williams, who is the ward's county councillor  and is hoping to double-up at both county and district level.  The Green candidate is Gary Luff, who used to be a senior executive for an insurance company but now works in the community sector.  Labour have reselected their candidate from 2021 Ela Pathak-Sen, who now works as a social entrepreneur following a 30-year career in the NHS.  The Lib Dems' Roz Savage completes a ballot paper of four candidates.  This column likes to highlight pubs which do their bit for democracy by serving as polling stations, so a shoutout is due to a pub which used to be frequented by Laurie Lee himself: the Woolpack Inn in Slad is doing its bit for democracy today.
