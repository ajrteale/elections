A quick update to an aside in last week's piece: your columnist's military band did indeed perform at the Menin Gate Last Post ceremony in Ieper last week, but due to a coach breakdown that happened on Friday rather than Thursday as planned.
</p><p>
There is just one by-election on 8th June 2023:
</p><p>
<h2>Tisbury</h2>
</p><p>
Wiltshire council; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Nick Errington.
</p><p>
The attention span of a Westminster journalist can be measured in days, as the press speculates over the immediate future of whichever Cabinet minister or wannabe Cabinet minister is in trouble this week.  One of the attractions of writing (and, hopefully, of reading) Andrew's Previews is that this column doesn't go in for that kind of stuff.  Here we have the space and time to take the long view, painting a picture of the history and politics of whatever area is under the spotlight this week.
</p><p>
Spotlights are, of course, an essential element of the theatre.  Generations of theatregoers have descended on the Sondheim Theatre in London's West End, which can be found on the corner of Shaftesbury Avenue and Wardour Street.  Recently renamed in honour of the late composer Stephen Sondheim, this theatre has since 2004 (with breaks for refurbishment and COVID) been home to the London production of Boublil and Schönberg's hit musical <em>Les Misérables</em>.  Les Mis may be set in France during the 19th century, but that doesn't mean its political themes are any less relevant today.
</p><p>
One of those themes is reinvention.  The revolutionaries man the barricades of Paris, attempting to overthrow the government.  The show's lead character Jean Valjean himself undergoes a transformation from Prisoner 24601 into the wealthy mayor of a small French town.  Inspector Javert fails to reinvent himself to match the changed circumstances of his life and Valjean's, and the result of that is that Javert comes to a sticky end.
</p><p>
Outside the Sondheim Theatre, Wardour Street has also reinvented itself many times.  It's now a one-way street through Soho, lined with restaurants on both sides.  In the 20th century this thoroughfare was a centre of the British film industry, home to a number of major film production companies and distributors.  In the 19th century Wardour Street had a reputation for its furniture and antique shops, which often targeted the cheaper end of the market.  Because of that association, Wardour Street itself gave its name to a form of English-language writing where archaic words are dropped into contemporary language for effect.  Heaven forfend that Andrew's Previews should ever stoop to that level.

</p><p>
The Sondheim Theatre isn't the only place close to Shaftesbury and Wardour.  Many of Soho's street names trace back to England's aristocracy in some form, and Wardour Street is a reference to the Lords Arundell of Wardour, who had had their residence at Wardour Castle in Wiltshire a few miles east of Shaftesbury.  Or at least they did until a siege in the English Civil War trashed the place, and the original Wardour Castle has lain in ruins ever since.
</p><p>
Don't be fooled by the name of its replacement, New Wardour Castle, which is not in fact a castle at all.  It's a Palladian country house from the eighteenth century, which was split up into apartments in the 1990s.  One of those apartments was until recently owned by Jasper Conran, a fashion designer who has also done a lot of work for theatre, opera and ballet productions.  Perhaps appropriately given the latter, New Wardour Castle served as the ballet school in the film <em>Billy Elliot</em>.  The old and new castles lie in the valley of the River Nadder, which rises just east of Shaftesbury; the upper part of its valley is known as the Vale of Wardour, after the castles.
</p><p>
The largest settlement in the Vale of Wardour is Tisbury, which has a railway connection on the West of England main line.  Tisbury railway station has regular trains connecting the village to the city of Salisbury, a few miles to the east.  In mediaeval times this journey was rather more arduous but also more profitable: much of the stone for Salisbury Cathedral was quarried in Tisbury.  We can see that there was a fair amount of money in Tisbury at that time by looking at the size of the village's tithe barn, which claims to have England's largest thatched roof: it's now run as an arts centre.
</p><p>
Tisbury is the main centre for its eponymous electoral division of Wiltshire, which also stretches south of the old and new Wardour Castles to take in the parishes of Donhead St Mary and Donhead St Andrew.  This area lies just to the east of the town of Shaftesbury, which - despite being over the county boundary in Dorset - is the main service centre for the Donhead parishes.
</p><p>

</p><p>
Despite the proximity of this area to Shaftesbury, we are very much in Wiltshire here.  Wiltshire council's last local elections were in 2021, at which boundary changes saw the small parish of Fonthill Gifford transferred into this division.  2021 was a good year for the Conservatives nationally, but they went backwards in Wiltshire by losing seven seats: one of those was Tisbury, which had previously been a rather safe Tory area but fell to the Lib Dems.  The Lib Dem candidate Nick Errington, a travel industry professional who had recently been co-opted to Tisbury parish council, polled 48% against 34% for long-serving Conservative county councillor Tony Deane; the other 19% went to the Green Party.  (Those figures do not add up to 100% due to rounding.)  Tisbury division is part of the South West Wiltshire parliamentary seat, which is represented in the Commons by junior defence minister and Conservative MP Andrew Murrison.
</p><p>
Errington has stood down about halfway through his four-year term, meaning that the Lib Dems have to defend a by-election.  Hoping to reinvent Tisbury's Lib Dem representation is their defending candidate Richard Budden, who lives in the ward; he has previously worked in the manufacturing industry and in a role promoting commercial sustainability.  Hoping to overthrow the old political order, although via the ballot box rather than the barricades, is the Conservative candidate Quentin Edwards, a farmer and amateur musician from the neighbouring parish of East Knoyle.  The Greens have not returned for this by-election, which is a straight fight between Budden and Edwards.  Readers will know that this column likes to highlight pubs which do their bit for democracy by acting as polling stations, so a shoutout is due to the Forester in Donhead St Andrew.
