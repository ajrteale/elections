A quick update to an aside in last week's piece: your columnist's military band did indeed perform at the Menin Gate Last Post ceremony in Ieper last week, but due to a coach breakdown that happened on Friday rather than Thursday as planned.
</p><p>
There is just one by-election on 8th June 2023:
</p><p>
<h2>Tisbury</h2>
</p><p>
Wiltshire council; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Nick Errington.

For our single poll today we are squarely in the West Country, coming to an electoral division of five parishes in the Vale of Wardour on the southern boundary of Wiltshire.  The largest of these parishes is Tisbury, which has a railway connection on the West of England main line: Tisbury railway station has regular trains connecting the village to the city of Salisbury.  In mediaeval times this journey was rather more arduous but also more profitable: much of the stone for Salisbury Cathedral was quarried in Tisbury.  We can see that there was a fair amount of money in Tisbury at that time by looking at the village's tithe barn, which claims to have England's largest thatched roof: it's now run as an arts centre.
</p><p>
The River Nadder rises to the south of Tisbury, in the parish of Donhead St Mary, before flowing through the parish of Donhead St Andrew.  This area lies just to the east of the town of Shaftesbury, which is over the county boundary in Dorset and is the main service centre for the Donhead parishes.
</p><p>
Close to the Donhead/Tisbury border we find Wardour Castle, a mediaeval structure which was left in ruins by a siege in the English Civil War.  Don't be fooled by the name of its replacement, New Wardour Castle, which is not in fact a castle at all: it's a Palladian country house which was split up into apartments in the 1990s.  One of those apartments was until recently owned by the fashion designer Jasper Conran, who has also done a lot of work for theatre, opera and ballet productions.  Perhaps appropriately given the latter, New Wardour Castle served as the ballet school in the film <em>Billy Elliot</em>.  The old castle gave its name to the Nadder valley, which as stated above is sometimes known as the Vale of Wardour.

Despite the proximity of this area to Shaftesbury, we are very much in Wiltshire here.  Wiltshire council's last local elections were in 2021, at which boundary changes saw the small parish of Fonthill Gifford transferred into this division.  2021 was a good year for the Conservatives nationally, but they went backwards in Wiltshire by losing seven seats: one of those was Tisbury, which had previously been a rather safe Tory area but fell to the Lib Dems.  The Lib Dem candidate Nick Errington, a travel industry professional who had recently been co-opted to Tisbury parish council, polled 48% against 34% for long-serving Conservative county councillor Tony Deane; the other 19% went to the Green Party.  (Those figures do not add up to 100% due to rounding.)  Tisbury division is part of the South West Wiltshire parliamentary seat, which is represented in the Commons by junior defence minister and Conservative MP Andrew Murrison.
</p><p>
Errington has stood down about halfway through his four-year term, meaning that the Lib Dems have to defend a by-election.  Their defending candidate is Richard Budden, who lives in the ward; he has previously worked in the manufacturing industry and in a role promoting commercial sustainability.  The Conservative candidate is Quentin Edwards, a farmer and amateur musician from the neighbouring parish of East Knoyle.  The Greens have not returned for this by-election, which is a straight fight between Budden and Edwards.  Readers will know that this column likes to highlight pubs which do their bit for democracy by acting as polling stations, so a shoutout is due to the Forester in Donhead St Andrew.
