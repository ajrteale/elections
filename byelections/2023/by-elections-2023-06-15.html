Six polls, for eleven seats, on 15th June 2023:
</p><p>
<h2>Bellshill</h2>
</p><p>
North Lanarkshire council, Scotland; caused by the resignation of Scottish National Party councillor Jordan Linden.
</p><p>
One of the things Andrew's Previews does is to tell the stories that don't get much attention outside <em>Private Eye</em>'s "Rotten Boroughs" column.  Which why we're going to start this week by considering the fallout from one of the most dramatic political falls from grace in recent years.  Never mind the latest episode of the Westminster psychodrama, let's go to North Lanarkshire.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/n-lanarks-bellshill.png" alt="N Lanarks, Bellshill" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Our venue is Bellshill, one of the many towns in Lanarkshire which were made by heavy industry.  Bellshill sat on top of a large amount of coal, and by the second half of the nineteenth century it was a major centre for coalmining and ironworking.  This has all gone now, leaving behind a post-industrial landscape with good transport links: Bellshill lies close to both the M8 and M74 motorways, while its railway station on the Shotts and Argyle Lines provides frequent links to Glasgow and Edinburgh.
</p><p>
At its industrial peak Bellshill attracted a large number of immigrants from Lithuania, whose descendants assimilated into Scottish life.  One very well-known local who was descended from Lithuanian grandparents was Billy McNeill, the footballer who captained Celtic's Lisbon Lions to their 1967 European Cup victory.  In an eighteen-year playing career McNeill played 822 senior competitive matches for Celtic and was never substituted; he won 31 major trophies with Celtic, both as a player and as a manager.  McNeill also dabbled in politics, standing for the Scottish Parliament in 2003 on the Central Scotland list of the Scottish Senior Citizens Unity Party.  A statue of him was unveiled in Bellshill last year.
</p><p>
Bellshill is part of the North Lanarkshire council area, whose main towns are Airdrie, Coatbridge, Cumbernauld and Motherwell.  This large chunk of the Central Belt was a very strong area for Scottish Labour until their 2015 collapse, and Labour held an absolute majority on North Lanarkshire council until 2017 despite the fact that the 2007 and 2012 elections were held under proportional representation.  Since 2017 the council has been hung with the SNP as the largest party: the 2022 North Lanarkshire local elections returned 36 SNP councillors, 32 Labour, 5 Conservatives, 2 Independents, 1 Green and 1 councillor from the British Unionist Party.
</p><p>
The Bellshill ward was expanded from three councillors to four by boundary changes in 2017.  The two contests on the current boundaries have both turned in close results.  In 2017 the first preferences were 38% to Labour, 37% for the SNP and 18% for the Conservatives; Labour and the Conservatives picked up transfers from an independent candidate and UKIP to give a seat count of 2 Labour, 1 SNP and 1 Conservative.  In 2022 the SNP took the lead on first preferences with 41% against 39% for Labour and 14% for the Conservatives, and the Nationalists easily gained the Conservative seat to give a 2-2 split of councillors in the ward.  Top of the poll in Bellshill last year was the SNP's Jordan Linden who was re-elected for a second term of office.  Aged just 27, he then became the first SNP leader of North Lanarkshire council, running a minority administration.
</p><p>
And then it all went wrong.  After just two months in the top job, Linden was forced to resign as leader in July 2022 over allegations that he had made unwanted sexual advances towards a teenage boy at a party in 2019.  The fallout from this led to the collapse of the SNP minority administration, and Labour took back control of North Lanarkshire with a minority administration of their own.  Jordan Linden then quit the council in March following further sexual harassment allegations, and in May the SNP group split: eight former SNP councillors are now in the "Progressive Change" group on the council.  The SNP are now down to 25 seats on North Lanarkshire council, plus this vacancy.
</p><p>
Bellshill has been namechecked in a parliamentary seat for many years.  The current Westminster parliamentary seat is called "Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill", and it has alternated between Labour and the SNP at all of the last four Westminster elections; however, part of Bellshill ward is actually in the Motherwell and Wishaw parliamentary seat, which has been SNP-held since 2015.  Both of these are seats which Scottish Labour will have their eye on given the recent fall in the SNP's national polling.  The local Scottish Parliament constituency is Uddingston and Bellshill, which has been in SNP hands since 2016; Richard Lyle, who was the MSP for that seat from 2016 to 2021, used to be a councillor for Bellshill ward.
</p><p>
This by-election is the first Scottish local by-election since Humza Yousaf took over as SNP leader and First Minister.  It will be held using the Alternative Vote, which makes this seat tricky for the SNP to defend.  The Nationalist vote is in a minority here, and Labour are likely to pick up strong transfers from the Conservatives once they are eliminated.  If we re-count the votes from last year for a single seat then it would go to Labour councillor Angela Campbell, who on a forced choice would beat the SNP's Linden by 52-48; that was in 2022 conditions.  This column wouldn't go quite as far as Ballot Box Scotland, whose opinion in their preview was that "unless the Labour candidate is caught in the act of kicking a puppy down the street, there surely has to be no way they lose this by-election" (<a href="https://ballotbox.scot/preview-bellshill/">link</a>), but given the local and national disarray of their opponents Labour should be extremely disappointed if they don't get a better result than last time.  Votes at 16 are also in effect for Scottish local elections, and voter ID is not required for this poll.
</p><p>
Defending for the SNP is Joseph Budd, a civil engineer who has appeared in this column before: he was an independent candidate in a March 2021 by-election for the neighbouring Thorniewood ward, finishing in third place with a creditable 19%.  Hoping not to get caught kicking a puppy down the street is Labour candidate Anne McCrory, who is the only one of the ten candidates here with no previous electoral history.  The Conservatives have reselected Colin Cameron, who was their councillor here from 2017 to 2022 when he lost re-election.  Also standing are (deep breath, here we go) John Marshall for Alba, John Cole for the Lib Dems, Leo Lanahan for the Scottish Family Party, Rosemary McGowan for the Greens, Simona Panaitescu for the Freedom Alliance, Billy Ross for the British Unionist Party and Neil Wilson for UKIP.

<h2>Hendon</h2>
</p><p>
Sunderland council, Tyne and Wear; postponed from 4th May following the death of Conservative candidate Syed Ali.
</p><p>
We now come to the first of our pieces of unfinished business from this May's ordinary local elections.  There were nine wards this year in which the election had to be abandoned after a candidate died during the election campaign; that's about the same number as in 2019, the last comparable local election year.  In those wards nominations were reopened, although candidates who had already been nominated did not need to reapply; and a new date was set for the poll.  Four of these have been rescheduled for today, and the other five postponed polls will take place next week.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/sunderland-hendon.png" alt="Sunderland, Hendon" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Which brings us to the Hendon ward of the city of Sunderland.  This is the east end of the city, and it's an unambiguously industrial area on the North Sea coast.  Here we find Sunderland Docks, which were once part of the city's shipbuilding empire; ships are no longer made in Sunderland, but Hudson Dock is still a reasonably busy seaport.  It's now in the hands of the city council.  Behind the seafront are rows of tightly-packed Victorian terraces and a lot of deprivation: all of the ward's census districts are within the 20% most deprived in England, and Hendon ward's unemployment rate - 7.3% in the 2021 census - is within the top 80 wards in England and Wales.  As well as Hendon itself, the ward takes in the East End of Sunderland and part of the city centre.
</p><p>
Hendon's most famous son is the footballer Raich Carter, a striker who was captain of Sunderland FC's league-winning side of 1935-36.  The Second World War robbed Carter of his best playing years, but he has the distinction of being the only player to win an FA Cup winner's medal both before and after the war, doing so with Sunderland in 1937 and with Derby County in 1946.  He also won 13 England caps, and proved he was good at multiple sports by playing four first-class cricket matches for Derbyshire.  A sports centre in the ward is named after him.
</p><p>
Also here is the memorial to one of the UK's worst crowd-crush disasters.  In June 1883 the Victoria Hall in Sunderland hosted a children's variety show, which ended with an announcement that children holding tickets with certain numbers would receive a prize on exit.  This caused the children in the gallery to surge downstairs; but the door at the bottom of the stairs to the gallery was partially locked closed and the gap left was only large enough for one child to pass at a time.  A total of 183 children, aged between 3 and 14, were crushed to death by the weight of the crowd behind them.  This disaster led directly to the invention of the push-bar emergency exit door, which is now standard in public entertainment venues.
</p><p>
The ward is part of the Labour-held Sunderland Central parliamentary seat, which was marginal in 2019 because it contains most of the best Conservative areas of the city.  Hendon is not one of those areas; in city council elections this was a safe Labour ward until 2021, when the Liberal Democrats came from sixth place to suddenly win a seat.  Labour did hold the ward in 2022, but it remains marginal with Labour on 46% and the Lib Dems on 38%.
</p><p>
Five candidates had submitted nomination papers for May's election here, which was called off when the Conservative candidate Syed Ali died.  He was standing here for the fourth time, having previously contested Hendon ward in 2016, 2018 and 2022.  Nominations were reopened and the Conservatives nominated a replacement candidate; no other new candidates came forward.
</p><p>
The outgoing Labour councillor Lynda Scanlan is seeking re-election.  Scanlan works as a solicitor and was Mayor of Sunderland in 2018-19; she was first elected for the neighbouring Millfield ward in 2011, and served two terms there before transferring to Hendon ward in 2019.  By that point, Millfield had become a safe Lib Dem ward, so there's more than a hint of the chicken run about that change.  The Lib Dem candidate is Steven Donkin, who works in the voluntary sector.  Also standing are the replacement Conservative candidate Georgina Young, Helmut Izaks for the Green Party and Ian Jones for Reform UK.

<h2>Hilton</h2>
</p><p>
South Derbyshire council; a re-run of the 4th May ordinary election, which was abandoned following the death of outgoing Conservative councillor Gillian Lemmon who was seeking re-election.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/s-derbys-hilton.png" alt="S Derbys, Hilton" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
For our Midlands poll this week it's time for the first entry in what's likely to become a recurring theme in this column over the next few years, as we consider the detail of just how badly the Conservatives performed in the May 2023 local elections.  To start on this theme we've come to the village of Hilton, which lies about nine miles to the south-west of Derby in the valley of the River Dove.  It's bypassed by the modern A50 dual carriageway, which provides a fast link from Derby to Stoke-on-Trent and is one of England's quieter east-west routes.  The Hilton ward of South Derbyshire takes in six-and-a-bit other parishes on the northern side of the Dove, surrounding the village of Hatton on three sides.
</p><p>
Mention of the word "Hilton" will inevitably be followed in many people's minds with the word "hotel".  Well, until very recently there was a hotel in Hilton: specifically the Hilton House Hotel, a Georgian building which was home to the Massey family until 1933.  It was converted into a hotel in the 1960s, and your columnist has played quiz there.  Unfortunately, the Hilton House Hotel went out of business in February this year, reportedly owing £28,000 to its staff and £273,000 to creditors.
</p><p>
In 1898 Hilton House was the birthplace of Herbert Massey, who went on to have a stellar career in the Royal Flying Corps and the Royal Air Force.  Massey fought and was wounded in both World Wars, and in 1942 he was incarcerated in Stalag Luft III after his aircraft was shot down near the Dutch coast.  With the rank of Group Captain, he was the camp's Senior British Officer who gave the go-ahead for the Great Escape in 1944.  Massey did not participate in the escape himself because of his injuries, which meant that he was the officer who received the news that many of the escapers had been executed.  He was repatriated to Britain on health grounds shortly afterwards, and retired from the RAF in 1950 with the rank of Air Commodore.
</p><p>
The present Hilton ward was drawn up for the 2011 local elections and returns three South Derbyshire councillors.  All elections here since then have returned the Conservative slate with large majorities, with the May 2019 result giving the Tories a 55-28 lead over Labour.
</p><p>
Indeed, until recently South Derbyshire as a whole was a good indication of how well the party was doing in the Midlands.  The May 2019 council elections returned a Conservative majority of 22-14 over Labour; the parliamentary seat (which has the same boundaries as the borough) had a Conservative majority of almost 20,000 votes in December 2019, and in the May 2021 Derbyshire county council elections the Tories won a clean sweep of all eight county divisions in the district.
</p><p>
However, by May 2021 the stormclouds were already on the horizon here.  The ruling Conservative group on South Derbyshire council had suffered a damaging split, and the splinter group had removed the Conservative leader and installed a Labour minority administration.  Hilton ward councillor Jason Whittenham resigned from the council in Janaury 2020; no by-election was called before the pandemic hit, and his seat remained vacant for more than a year.  Hilton ward councillor Andy Billings also resigned in April 2020; it's now clear this was a direct result of the infighting in the South Derbyshire Conservatives, and Billings subsequently complained about a tasteless and offensive meme attacking him which had been produced by one of the dissident Conservative councillors (<a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/news/local-news/ex-tory-cleared-over-grotesque-6564986">link</a>).
</p><p>
Once the pandemic eased a double by-election was held in May 2021 to replace both Billings and Whittenham.  The Conservative held both seats and increased their share of the vote to 57%, with the Lib Dems - who had not previously stood here - taking the runner-up spot on 20%.  On the same day the Conservatives held the Hilton county division - which is larger than this ward - with a larger majority over Labour.
</p><p>
The candidates elected here in the 2021 double by-election were Gillian Lemmon and Peter Smith.  They were both nominated for re-election in May 2023 by the Conservatives; the ward's other councillor, Julie Patten, stood down and was replaced on their slate by Sundip Meghani.  Polling was completed at 22:00 on 4th May and the ballot papers were securely stored overnight, with the count scheduled to begin the following morning.
</p><p>
On the morning of 5th May Gillian Lemmon's health suddenly failed, and she passed away at around 12:45.  She was just 52 years old.  When the returning officer was informed of the death, counting was still going on and the result for Hilton ward had not been declared.  Under the English local election rules, this meant that the returning officer had no option but to abandon the whole election for Hilton ward and re-run it at a later date.  A side-effect was that Peter Smith, who was the leader of the council's Conservative group, would not be able to participate in the AGM later in May.
</p><p>
The results in the other South Derbyshire wards were declared as scheduled, and they were not good for the Conservatives.  Derbyshire was one of the counties where the Tories performed worst in May, and they now control none of the county's district councils.  South Derbyshire went from Labour minority to Labour majority: Labour won 23 seats on the council against 9 Conservatives and 1 independent, with the three seats in Hilton ward yet to come.
</p><p>
The original ballot in Hilton ward had full slates of three candidates for the Conservatives, the Lib Dems and Labour.  On the defending Conservative slate, Peter Smith is as stated seeking re-election for a second term; Sundip Meghani is a solicitor and a senior investigations officer for the accountancy body ACCA, and he was also a Labour councillor in Leicester from 2011 to 2015; and Rosa Fawcett has been nominated to replace the late Gillian Lemmon.  On the Lib Dem side, Hilton parish councillor Grahame Andrew was the runner-up in the 2021 by-election, and he is joined by Hilton residents Jayne Davies (a childminder) and Tilo Scheel (a German-born GP and tennis coach).  The Labour slate of Martin Atherton, and Angela and David Peacock, completes the ballot paper; no other new candidates have come forward.  With three seats available, electors here may cast up to three votes.

<h2>Frimley Green</h2>
</p><p>
Surrey Heath council; postponed from 4th May following the death of Conservative candidate Karen Campion.
</p><p>
Are you ready?  Ladies and gentlemen, let's now continue the theme of councils with poor Conservative results last month by travelling to the district of Surrey Heath, whose largest town is Camberley.  This is one of a number of towns in the Blackwater valley which have fused together to form a conurbation that straddles the counties of Surrey, Hampshire and Berkshire.  As a result, this urban area is spectacularly poorly served by our local government structure.  Maybe our current cabinet minister responsible for local government could sort this out: that's Michael Gove, who is the MP for, er, Surrey Heath.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/surrey-heath-frimley-green-2023.png" alt="Surrey Heath, Frimley Grn" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Frimley Green still has a bit of a village feel to it even though it's now part of this urban area.  The Blackwater valley towns have traditionally had an economy dominated by the Army and aerospace, but the largest single employer in Frimley Green is a large factory making SC Johnson cleaning products; and the town is best known for flying projectiles which, while sharp, are distinctly not military.  Frimley Green is home to the Lakeside Country Club, which from 1986 until 2019 advertised itself as the "Home of World Darts", being the venue for the BDO World Darts Championship.  (The tournament moved to the madhouse of the O2 in London in January 2020 for a tournament which fell short of financial expectations.  As all darts players know, if you go for madhouse and fall short with your first shot then you go bust, and that's what subsequently happened to the BDO.)
</p><p>
Full disclosure: Your columnist once aimed three darts at a dartboard on the stage of the Lakeside in Frimley Green, and missed the scoring area of the board with every one.  This game is harder than it looks on the telly.
</p><p>
The Surrey Heath Lib Dems managed to successfully check out overall control of the council from the Conservatives in May.  There are currently 21 Lib Dem councillors against just six remaining Conservatives, 3 councillors for a Community Group and 2 Labour, with the three seats in Frimley Green ward yet to poll.  In May 2019 Frimley Green was in the Lib Dem column with 49% for the Lib Dems against 29% for the Conservatives and 13% for UKIP.  One of the Lib Dem councillors resigned in 2021 on health grounds, and the resulting by-election in October 2021 resulted in a very narrow Conservative gain from the Lib Dems by 48-47; the Conservative majority was just nineteen votes.  Almost all of the ward is part of the Frimley Green and Mytchett division of Surrey county council, which was safely Conservative back in May 2021.
</p><p>
So, all to play for in this election, which had to be postponed after one of the Conservative candidates, Karen Campion, passed away during the election campaign.  On the Conservative side, the 2021 by-election winner Stuart Black is seeking re-election.  He is joined by former Spelthorne councillor Howard Thomson and solicitor Attieh Fard, who replaces Campion on the ballot.  On the Lib Dem side, outgoing councillor Sashi Mylvaganam is seeking a second term here while Cliff Betton was successfully re-elected in May in the neighbouring ward of Mytchett and Deepcut; he swaps with Helen Whitcroft, who was mayor of Surrey Heath in 2022-23 as councillor for that ward and is now seeking re-election here.  Mylvaganam and Whitcroft are joined on the Lib Dem slate by Jacques Olmo, who was the runner-up in the 2021 by-election.  No new candidates have come forward, so this time we have a straight fight between the Lib Dems and Conservatives.

For our last piece of unfinished business this week we have come to a very rugged and beautiful part of the country.  The Burrator ward of West Devon lies entirely within the Dartmoor National Park, covering four parishes to the north and east of Yelverton together with a lot of moorland.  None of those parishes is called Burrator; the ward name instead comes from Burrator Reservoir, which was completed in 1898 to supply drinking water to nearly Plymouth and expanded in 1929.
</p><p>
This reservoir and the nearby parishes of Meavy and Sheepstor were major filming locations for Stephen Spielberg's 2011 film <em>War Horse</em>, which was nominated for six Academy Awards including Best Picture.  Spielberg was so taken with the Dartmoor countryside that he cut other elements of the screenplay to allow more of the film to take place here.
</p><p>
For the purposes of beautiful countryside, it perhaps helps that Meavy and Sheepstor parishes are very sparsely populated.  The majority of the electors in Burrator ward live in Horrabridge, a village of slightly over 2,000 people which is located on the River Walkham and on the main road between Tavistock and Plymouth.
</p><p>
Horrabridge was added to Burrator ward by boundary changes in 2015, which also increased the ward's representation from one councillor to two.  The 2015 election here returned independent candidate David Cloke, who had previously represented Horrabridge as part of the abolished Walkham ward, and long-serving Burrator ward councillor Diana Moyse for the Conservatives.  The pattern of candidates here in 2015 makes percentage shares difficult to calculate, but for what it's worth the Local Elections Archive Project gives 38% for independents, 37% for the Conservatives and 25% for the Green Party.  In 2019 independent councillor Cloke retired and was replaced by Tim Bolton of the Lib Dems; Bolton and the Conservative councillor Moyse were the only candidates for Burrator's two seats, so they were declared elected unopposed.
</p><p>
With no contested district election here since 2015, let's look at what's happening here at other levels of government.  Burrator ward is part of the Yelverton Rural division of Devon county council, which is safely in Conservative hands.  Since 2005 it has been represented in Westminster by the Conservatives' Sir Geoffrey Cox, a high-earning KC who served as Attorney General from 2018 to 2020.  He is the MP for the Torridge and West Devon constituency.
</p><p>
This poll has been postponed following the death of Neil Jameson, who had been nominated as a Green Party candidate for Burrator ward.  He devoted his life to community work.  In 1989 Jameson founded Citizens UK, which describes itself as "the home of community organising", and until 2017 he was its executive director.
</p><p>
Jameson never held elected office as far as I can tell, but he made a huge impact on the country nonetheless through Citizens UK's Living Wage Campaign, which has been going since 2001.  This spawned the Living Wage Foundation, which calculates two "real living wage" rates, one for London (currently £11.95 per hour) and one for the rest of the UK (£10.90 per hour).  As of September 2022 the Living Wage Foundation had accredited 11,000 businesses, including your columnist's employer - if you get an email from my work account, it will have the Living Wage Foundation's logo on it.
</p><p>
West Devon was yet another council where the Conservatives misplaced a majority at May's local elections.  They are still the largest party on the council with 11 seats out of 31, but an independent-led coalition of everyone else has been put together to run West Devon going forward.  The latest count gives 10 independent councillors, 4 Greens, 2 Lib Dems and 1 Labour, with three vacant seats: the two seats in Burrator ward yet to poll, and a by-election to replace a Green councillor which is scheduled for next week.
</p><p>
The revised ballot paper for Burrator has seven candidates.  Outgoing Conservative councillor Diana Moyse, who has been a West Devon councillor here since 1999, is seeking re-election for a seventh term of office; she is joined on the Conservative slate by Felix Davies.  The outgoing Lib Dem councillor Tim Bolton has stood down; originally the Lib Dems were going to run with one candidate, headteacher Christopher West, but the delay to the poll has allowed them to add Nick Viney whose Twitter account gives a job description of "landscape re-imagineer", whatever that is.  For the Green Party, Exeter University English professor Sam North remains from the original ballot paper and he is joined by replacement candidate Dave Miller.  The delay to the poll has also allowed Labour to join the fray, and they have nominated John Churchley.  Electors here may cast up to two votes.  A shoutout is due to the Burrator Inn in Dousland, which is doing its bit for democracy today by acting as a polling station.

<h2>Efford and Lipson</h2>
</p><p>
Plymouth council, Devon; caused by the death of Labour councillor Brian Vincent.
</p><p>

The southern boundary of West Devon's Burrator ward is the infant River Plym.  We finish for the week at the other end of the Plym, on the west bank of its estuary.  The Laira, as the upper part of the Plym estuary is known, is overlooked by the Plymouth suburbs of Efford and Lipson.  It's not as wide an estuary as it used to be.  In 1802 an embankment was built along its western shore, and the land behind it was reclaimed: this land is now occupied by the Lipson Co-operative Academy and the Laira railway depot, which repairs and maintains intercity trains for Great Western Railway.  Much of the housing near here was originally built for railway workers.
</p><p>
The embankment now carries the main road east from Plymouth city centre.  Before its building all traffic had to take the hilly Old Laira Road along Lipson Vale.  The hilly theme continues with Plymouth's eastern suburb of Efford, which stands on high ground overlooking the Laira.  Much of Efford was used by the US Army in the run-up to D-Day; the Americans didn't forget this, and after the war they sent a large number of prefabricated houses to Efford.  This "Little America" has since been replaced by more modern housing stock.
</p><p>
This area is part of the city of Plymouth, which is traditionally very competitive between the Conservatives and Labour: the 2023 local elections saw the council change hands between the two for the eighth time this century.  Since 2021 Plymouth had been under an exceptionally unstable period of Conservative leadership marked by a major split in the Conservative group, three council leaders in two years and the felling of a large number of mature trees in the city centre.  All this went down like a lead balloon with the electorate, and in May's local elections the Conservatives held just one of the nine seats they were defending.  Tudor Evans, who has led Plymouth council's Labour group continuously since 1998, is now leader of the city council for the fifth time.
</p><p>
Another long-standing Labour figure in the city was Brian Vincent, who passed away in April at the age of 73.  Vincent was first elected for Efford and Lipson ward in 1997, lost his seat in 2000, and returned in 2003 since when he had continuous service.  He was Lord Mayor of Plymouth in 2008-09.  In his working life Vincent had been a bus driver, and he got into politics as a Unite organiser at the local bus company.
</p><p>
Vincent's Efford and Lipson ward has voted Labour continuously since it took on its current boundaries in 2003.  Last month Labour led the Conservatives here 59-22, and it seems unlikely the Tories can stage a comeback from here given the current national and local political climate.
</p><p>
Defending for Labour is Paul McNamara, who is a hotel kitchen porter: he contested the neighbouring Drake ward in May, losing to an independent candidate.  The Conservatives have reselected their candidate here from May Will Jones; according to his profile on the excellent website whocanivotefor.co.uk (<a href="https://whocanivotefor.co.uk/person/105889/will-jones">link</a>), his favourite biscuit is a caramel digestive.  Also standing are Pat Bushell for the Greens, Alexander Primmer for the Lib Dems, Neil Prentice for the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition, Darryl Ingram for the Heritage Party and independent candidate Chaz Singh, a former Plymouth Labour councillor who unsuccessfully stood for re-election as an independent in May.
