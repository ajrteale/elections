We're very much in the dying days of this Westminster parliament.  The next general election can reasonably be expected some time next year, and the stage will soon be reached where any further vacancies in parliament can simply be left for the voters to fill then.  This column doesn't seriously expect to be writing any Parliamentary Specials for most of next year.  But before then we have three vacancies to fill in the House of Commons in October 2023, and the first one of these falls in the Glasgow urban area.  But this is not Glasgow.

Welcome to Rutherglen, a town whose centre lies just three miles south-east of Glasgow city centre.  This has been a Royal Burgh for almost nine centuries, receiving that title from an 1126 charter of King David I.  It's now firmly within the urban sprawl of greater Glasgow, but - apart from a short period between 1975 and 1996 - Rutherglen is not Glasgow.

It's reasonable to ask why this is - what was it that enabled Rutherglen to fight off annexation by the big city?   Well, if we look at similar industrial conurbations in north-west England a pattern starts to emerge.  Bootle is very much part of the Liverpool urban area, but it has its docks - and Bootle has never been covered by the city council.  Salford and Stretford are very much part of the Manchester urban area, but Salford had its docks on the Ship Canal and Stretford has the heavy industry of Trafford Park - both of them remain independent of Manchester to this day.

Rutherglen had those advantages too, as a centre of heavy industry with a location on the River Clyde.  Until the mid-twentieth century coalmining was a major employer; ships were built and launched into the river; there is still a steelworks in operation; and there is the legacy of the J and J White chemical works, which has given Rutherglen a long-term problem with chromate contamination in the ground.

Some idea of the scale of the industrial cleanup can be gleaned from a visit to the Cuningar Loop, a park located within a bend of the Clyde; once this was a sewage works for Glasgow, now it's filled with trees, public art and things for the kids to do on a nice day.  A footbridge has been thrown over the river to connect the site with the Dalmarnock Legacy Village, the former 2014 Commonwealth Games athletes' village in the east end of Glasgow.  There's even a boardwalk next to the Clyde, from which you might be able to glimpse the river through the ranks of toxic giant hogweed which grow on its banks.

The Cuningar Loop is rather cut off from Rutherglen's town centre by the lines of communication which connect Glasgow city centre to the south.  First we have the M74 motorway, driven through here in 2008-11 to relieve the M8 to the north.  The M74 is elevated on a viaduct above the platforms of Rutherglen railway station, which is linked to the town centre by a footbridge over four tracks of the West Coast main line.

On Rutherglen's unusually wide main street we can find the town hall, a Victorian building in the Scottish baronial style; the adjacent Old Parish Church with its unusual separate belltower; the Mercat Cross; and an indoor shopping mall.  Which, on my visit, had a stall outside staffed by campaigners from the Scottish Family Party.

To the south of here we have Rutherglen's housing, which has far outgrown the original burgh boundaries.  Some of the suburbs here are rather desirable places to live (Burnside), some less so (Fernhill).

There's a similar industrial history in Cambuslang, although without the burghal status; Cambuslang has a population of around 30,000 and merges seamlessly into Rutherglen, but it has never been an independent town of its own.  The housing stops at Halfway and at Newton, which is an important railway junction in Glasgow's local network.

At this point the River Clyde turns to running north-south, and a short period of greenbelt brings us to Blantyre.  This is of course the commercial centre of Malawi, whose name recalls a famous son of a different Blantyre a very long way away.

David Livingstone, the missionary and African explorer, was born in 1813 to a family working in a cotton mill on the banks of the Clyde.  The house in Blantyre where he grew up still stands and has been turned into a museum in his memory which is certainly no hagiography: among a dazzling array of exhibits, the display does not shy away from Livingstone's mistakes and shortcomings, and it pays proper tribute to the members of the teams he led on his various explorations at quite some danger to themselves.  Outside is some parkland containing this striking sculpture by Ray Harryhausen, depicting an episode in 1844 when Dr Livingstone was nearly killed by a lion.

[IMAGE HERE]

Unfortunately, on my first attempted visit (a Thursday in September), the David Livingstone Birthplace was closed.  This sense of being thwarted continues as we cross the dual carriageway going to East Kilbride, and enter the town of Hamilton.  Which is home to this striking mausoleum, built as the final resting place for the Dukes of Hamilton (although they have since been reinterred elsehwere).

[IMAGE HERE]

Apparently it's even more bizarre inside, and the interior space holds the record for the world's longest echo.  I was dying to get into the mausoleam and hear this for myself, but it turns out that South Lanarkshire Council only open it on two days a month; this was not one of those days.

In fact, I was doubly thwarted because the Hamilton Mausoleum is off-topic for this piece.  For some reason the Scottish Boundary Commissioners have had it in for the town of Hamilton over the years: since 1997 it has been divided between two Westminster seats, and the part currently contained within Rutherglen and Hamilton West does not contain the mausoleam.  Or the racecourse.  Or the town centre.

[IMAGE HERE]

Or even the Modernist Architectural Heaven Circa 1960 which is the wonderfully-retro Lanark County Buildings.  Opened in 1964 by the Queen Mother and clearly modelled on the UN headquarters in New York, this was originally the headquarters of Lanarkshire county council; since 1996 it has performed the same function for South Lanarkshire council.

All of that is frustratingly off-topic.  What we are left with is Hamilton's western residential areas, which are similar to Rutherglen and Cambuslang in that we have a mix of desirable suburbs (Earnock) and deprived areas (Udston).  We also have some quite large business parks next to the dual carriageway, which include this striking new building that houses the Lanarkshire campus of the University of the West of Scotland.

Rutherglen has been the centre of its own Westminster constituency since 1918.  Before then it was one component of an unusual feature of Scottish elections in times past: Districts of Burghs constituencies.  These were a series of disconnected smallish towns which were grouped together to form a single, if fragmented, urban constituency.  From 1885 until the seat's dissolution in 1918, Rutherglen was a member of the Kilmarnock District of Burghs, along with Dumbarton, Renfrew, Port Glasgow and Kilmarnock itself.

If we take as a best fit for the constituency the Rutherglen and Cambuslang wards plus Blantyre and Hamilton West and Earnock, then the 2022 local elections across the seat gave 39% of the first preferences to the SNP, 34% to Labour, and 11% each to the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives; with proportional representation in effect, that translated to 9 SNP councillors, 7 Labour and 3 Lib Dems.  Labour carried Blantyre ward, with the SNP topping the poll everywhere else.  The reason why the Lib Dems won three seats and the Conservatives nothing is mostly to do with the Lib Dem vote being very concentrated in the three wards where they won seats, while the Conservatives were quite evenly distributed.

But because this is Scotland we can do a bit better than that, thanks to the tireless work of Allan Faulds who has collected the full breakdown of first preferences by polling district from the 2022 Scottish local elections.  Because of the way in which small polling districts were merged to preserve the anonymity of the ballot it's still not possible to get a completely accurate picture of how the constituency voted, but if we do a best fit by adding in polling districts 135 to 137 and 175 from Hamilton North and East ward, adding polling district 150 from Hamilton South ward and removing polling district 147 from Hamilton West and Earnock, the above percentages - don't actually change very much, but we can see that the Conservatives polled third across the constituency rather than the Lib Dems, with 10.9% against 10.5%.

South Lanarkshire wards: Blantyre, Cambuslang East, Cambuslang West (almost all), Hamilton North and East (part), Hamilton South (part), Hamilton West and Earnock (part), Rutherglen Central and North, Rutherglen South
