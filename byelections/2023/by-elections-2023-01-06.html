Welcome to the New Year.  It's the fifth day of January, which is of course Twelfth Night, traditionally a time for wassailing, feasting and merriment to mark the end of the Christmas festivities, a time when the normal order of things is reversed and the Lord of Misrule is in charge.  Done properly, Twelfth Night should be a severe test for your New Year's resolutions - assuming that you've got this far into the year and can still remember what they are.

If your New Year's resolution is to remain madly in love with your partner, then here's a challenge for you.  Go to Dunmow in 2024 and claim your prize.  All you and your other half have to do is convince a jury that you have been married for twelve months and never had an argument or regretted your marriage in that time, and you could win a Flitch of Bacon.  The Dunmow Flitch Trials have been going for ages - there are references to them in the fourteenth-century <em>Wife of Bath's Tale</em> from Chaucer's <em>Canterbury Tales</em> - but bringing home the bacon is not as easy as it sounds, because the organisers will hire proper legal counsel to cross-examine you.  And, this being the 21st century rather than the 14th, you might also end up as a star of YouTube.

The Flitch trials take place in the Essex town of Great Dunmow, a market town located on a Roman road running west from Colchester.  The Roman road has been superseded by the A120, which now bypasses Great Dunmow to the south to provide faster connections from eastern Essex to Stansted Airport.  Just beyond the bypass is the parish of Barnston on the road towards Chelmsford, which was added to Great Dunmow South ward in 2015.

Stansted Airport is the major employer in the Uttlesford local government district, which is named after an ancient hundred of north-western Essex and is based in Saffron Walden.  It has similar boundaries to the Saffron Walden parliamentary seat, a safe Conservative unit which has had only four MPs in the last 80 years.  The current MP here, the International Trade secretary Kemi Badenoch, was a contender for the Conservative leadership in last year's first leadership election; one of her predecessors as MP for Saffron Walden, the great Conservative politician R A Butler, would almost certainly have been a Conservative leadership candidate himself if the party had had leadership elections in his day.

However, Uttlesford council has not been reliably Conservative in recent years.  The electorate here has recently turned to localism in a big way, and the 2019 Uttlesford elections resulted in an overall majority for the Residents for Uttlesford slate.  Overall the Residents won 26 seats, against 7 Lib Dems, just four Conservatives (who had run the council with a majority since 2007) and 2 independents.  The Residents also hold two of the district's four seats on Essex county council, although Dunmow division (which covers this ward) remains in Conservative hands.  Great Dunmow South and Barnston ward is included in the Residents' council majority, with R4U gaining the ward's three seats from the Conservatives in 2019 by 56-32.

Residents' councillor Colin Day moved to Norfolk in autumn 2021, and submitted his resignation from the council around twelve months later.  There is just time to hold a by-election to get a new councillor in place before the next Uttlesford elections in May 2023.

Defending for Residents for Uttlesford is Kerry Herbert, who works in marketing and lives in Barnston.  The Conservative candidate Tom Loveday - he's going to have to love longer than that if he wants to get through the Flitch Trial - is a parish councillor in Flitch Green, a 21st-century village just outside the boundary of this ward.  Also standing are Ben Cavanagh for Labour and Lorraine Flawn for the Libearl Democrats.

<h2>Etching Hill and The Heath</h2>

Cannock Chase council, Staffordshire; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor James Fletcher.

Our first proper Conservative versus Labour contest of 2013 comes in Staffordshire.  We've come to the town of Rugeley, which can be found in the Trent Valley on the northern edge of Cannock Chase.  The Chase was a royal forest back in the day, and still forms a large area of woodland and heathland on high ground, separating Rugeley from the town of Cannock to the south.  Cannock Chase forms the smallest Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty on the English mainland, and a large chunk of the AONB is covered by Etching Hill and The Heath ward.

The woodlands here aren't always tranquil.  Cannock Chase is still in government hands, with the Forestry Commission being the current landowner.  One of the Commission's moneymaking schemes is Forest Live, a series of concerts which brings well-known artists and bands to the UK's forests every summer.  The Birches Valley Forest Centre, just outside Rugeley and close to the village of Slitting Mill, is a regular Forest Live venue.

Etching Hill itself is the north-west corner of Rugeley.  Its census figures are much of a muchness: some sources describe Etching Hill is an upmarket part of the town and this is borne out to some extent by the statistics, but the ward also has one census district with very high levels of deprivation.

So, obviously, this area voted Liberal Democrat in local elections until 2011, after which the Lib Dem vote fell away and the party can't even find candidates here now.  After some unstable results here in the Coalition years, which included a UKIP win in 2014, Etching Hill and the Heath ward has now settled down into being a safe Conservative ward.  In May last year the ward voted 48% Conservative and 35% Labour, which marked a bit of a Labour revival after very strong Conservative performances in 2019 and 2021.

The outgoing councillor James Fletcher was first elected in 2022, having entered local politics shortly after finishing a 22-year career as a West Midlands Police officer.  For whatever reason, it hasn't worked out for him and Fletcher submitted his resignation from the council after six months.  As such the winner of this by-election is due to serve until May 2026, although it's likely this term will be cut short because the Local Government Boundary Commission are currently consulting on a new ward map for Cannock Chase: that map should be ready in time for the 2024 local elections.

Cannock Chase council has the same boundaries as the Cannock Chase parliamentary seat, which had a Conservative majority of almost 20,000 votes in December 2019.  Its MP, Amanda Milling, served in the Johnson Cabinet from February 2020 to September 2021 as Conservative Party chairman and minister without portfolio.  In percentage terms the Etching Hill and Heath division of Staffordshire county council, which is larger than this ward, had a similar Conservative lead in 2021.

Those strong Conservative performances resulted in a Conservative majority on Cannock Chase council, for the first time, after the 2021 local elections.  It's not that big a majority: the latest council composition has 23 Conservative councillors plus this vacancy against 9 Labour, 4 independents, 2 Greens and 2 Lib Dems.  The council majority doesn't look in immediate danger based on last year's election results, but a by-election two months ago in Cannock West ward did result in a strong swing to Labour compared with May's result.  A repeat of that swing would make this by-election very close indeed, although this is a ward which Labour have never won this century.

So nobody can afford to be complacent in this by-election, which is a straight fight.  Defending in the blue corner is Laura Harrison, who is a town councillor in Hednesford on the far side of the Chase.  Challenging from the red corner is Darren Foley, who lives in the ward and is a professional youth worker; he previously stood here in 2021 and 2022.  The Chase is on!
