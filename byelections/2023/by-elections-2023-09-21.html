Four by-elections on 21st September 2023:

<h2>Newport Pagnell South</h2>

Milton Keynes council, Buckinghamshire; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Scot Balazs.

Two of our by-elections today are in wards in the south of England which have been the subject of a lot of new housebuilding.  The New City of Milton Keynes is the new housing scheme to end all new housing schemes, and that has left its mark on the census.  Milton Keynes has England and Wales' largest concentration of homes in shared ownership, with five of the top ten wards in England and Wales for that form of tenure being here; Newport Pagnell South is not one of those, but its 4.7% of households in shared ownership is within the top 80 wards in England and Wales.

There has been manufacturing in Newport Pagnell for longer than Milton Keynes has existed.  In the 1950s the town became home to the Aston Martin car factory; Aston Martin cars are now assembled in Warwickshire, but the firm still has some manufacturing presence here.  Back in the day many Aston Martin owners would have tried their cars out on the adjoining M1 motorway, which opened in 1959 (making it older than Milton Keynes) and originally had no speed limit.

Manufacturing from a different age can still be found in Newport Pagnell in the form of William Cowley, the UK's last manufacturer of vellum.  Until 2017 Cowley's played a major role in the UK's democracy, because the official archive copies of Acts of Parliament were printed on vellum until then; this wasn't just for the sake of tradition, but because vellum lasts a lot longer than paper does.  Since 2000 the House of Lords, which pays the bill for this service, had been trying to cut costs by ending the vellum contract; they eventually got their way in 2017 over the protests of the Commons, with a compromise being reached that future archive copies of Acts would be printed on paper and bound in vellum.

It wasn't just for the sake of tradition that the Commons were unhappy with this move.  Newport Pagnell forms part of the Milton Keynes North constituency, which has been in Conservative hands since its creation in 2010 but is definitely a key marginal seat where the MP - who is currently first-term Tory backbencher Ben Everitt - will want to be seen to promote local jobs and industry, whichever party they represent.

Milton Keynes may be a key Tory-Labour battleground in general elections, but local elections here are more complicated.  The city council has been hung since 2006, with all three major Westminster parties having strong representation; the current score is 27 Labour councillors, 15 Lib Dems, and 14 Conservatives plus this vacancy.  Labour look well-placed to take a majority here in the 2024 local elections, but for now they govern in coalition with the Lib Dems.

One of the New City's longest-standing Liberal Democrat wards is Newport Pagnell South, which has voted for the Lib Dems in all but one election over the last 21 years.  The May 2023 result here was fairly typical: 46% for the Liberal Democrats, 34% for the Conservatives, 16% for Labour.  The only year in which the Lib Dems failed to win here was 2021, when the ward returned the Conservative candidate Scot Balazs.

Unfortunately, this by-election has come out of the Councillors Behaving Badly file.  On 1st February, Councillor Balazs caused a road accident: he veered across the road, and crashed into a van travelling in the opposite direction.  The van, which was owned by Bluebell Flowers, a florist's shop in Newport Pagnell, was a write-off.  Balazs was an uninsured driver, so Bluebell Flowers never received any compensation for the loss of the van.

In May Councillor Balazs pleaded guilty to driving without due care and attention, driving without insurance and driving alone while holding only a provisional driving licence.  He was fined £660 and given six penalty points on his licence.  For some reason, the case was heard by High Wycombe magistrates rather than in the New City, which meant that the Milton Keynes local press initially missed the story.  It took until August, when Bluebell Flowers announced that their shop was closing down as a result of the financial loss caused by the crash, for the <em>Milton Keynes Citizen</em> to start asking questions.  Once the <em>Citizen</em> had found out about Councillor Balazs's conviction they approached the leader of Milton Keynes' Conservative group for comment; it appears that this whole affair came as news to them, too.  Within the hour, Scot Balazs had tendered his resignation from the council.

The difficult task of defending the resulting by-election for the Conservatives has fallen to Ade Adeliyi, who has been an unsuccessful candidate in the last three Milton Keynes local elections; in May he contested Bletchley West ward.  The Liberal Democrats, who topped the poll here in May and will be hoping to recover the seat which they lost in 2021, have selected Newport Pagnell town councillor Tony Oyakhire.  The Labour candidate is Saskia Soden, a 21-year-old student who is currently reading philosophy, politics and economics at the LSE.  Also standing are independent candidate Lynn Cocksedge (he stood here in May on the Reform UK ticket) and Gary Lloyd for the Green Party.

Before we leave Newport Pagnell, I should say that a fundraising page has been set up to raise money to buy Bluebell Flowers a new van.  I've chipped in with a donation myself.

<h2>Bricknell</h2>

Kingston upon Hull council, East Riding; caused by the disqualification of Labour councillor Sarah Harper-Riches.

We now travel north to one of England's least-visited cities.  That's a shame, because Kingston upon Hull has a surprising amount to offer to the casual visitor; particularly the city centre, which has some rather handsome areas.  However, it's normally the job of this column to write about less-heralded areas, which is how we come to Bricknell.

Bricknell ward lies on the north-western edge of the city, centered on the dual-carriageway Bricknell Avenue and running up to the point where the Hull city limits merge imperceptibly into Cottingham.  The southern corner of the ward is occupied by the former Ideal Standard factory, which manufactured bathroom fittings and fixtures on this site until quite recently; Ideal Standard still have offices and a showroom here, but it's no longer a factory shop.  The eastern corner of the ward contains Hull's most expensive housing: this is Newland Park, located just to the south of the University of Hull campus and home for many years to the university's librarian and noted poet Philip Larkin.  Among the 1930s to 1950s housing which predominates in Bricknell ward can be found Hull's Northern Cemetery, the Kelvin Hall secondary school (whose most notable former pupil is probably the Hull City and England football player Nick Barmby) and the adjacent Wyke Sixth Form College, which takes its name from a former name for the city.

There are two MPs currently in the Commons who took their A-levels at Wyke Sixth Form College, Labour's Emma Hardy (who represents Hull West and Hessle and was recently promoted to the party's junior frontbench team), and the Conservatives' Andrew Percy.  Hull city council is a Tory-free zone now, with all current councillors having been elected as either Lib Dem or Labour; the score currently stands at 32-24 to the Lib Dems, plus this vacancy.

This two-party duopoly is however fairly recent.  The city's last Conservative councillor was political veteran and former Lord Mayor John Fareham, who had represented Bricknell ward since 1983 and led the city's Conservative group since 1987; he lost his seat to Labour candidate Sarah Harper in 2022 by a margin of 53-36.  That was a good Labour performance, given that for some years previously Bricknell had been the city's last Tory redoubt.  Andrew Percy started his political career by being elected as a Bricknell ward councillor in 2000, serving for ten years alongside Fareham before leaving the city council to become the Conservative MP for Brigg and Goole.  That constituency will disappear at the next general election, at which Percy will retire.

Neither Percy nor Hardy represent Bricknell ward in Parliament; it's part of the Hull North constituency which has been in Labour hands for decades.  Dame Diana Johnson, who has represented the seat since 2005 and previously sat on Tower Hamlets council and (briefly) on the London Assembly, is currently chair of the Commons Home Affairs select committee.  Her constituency is undersized, and will expand outside the city (and be renamed Hull North and Cottingham) for the next general election; that should improve the Cosnervative position in the seat but probably not by enough to make it competitive, particularly in the current political climate.

A couple of future Tory MPs have tried and failed to defeat Johnson here in recent years, including an extremely young Dehenna Davison who finished third here in 2015 while she was a 21-year-old reading politics at Hull University just over the ward boundary.  Davison went on to marry then-councillor John Fareham in 2018 in a wedding which was covered by the Channel 4 reality TV series <em>Bride and Prejudice</em>: at the time she was 24 and he was 59.  The marriage didn't last, and by the time Davison became MP for Bishop Auckland in December 2019 they had separated.

Davison's ex-partner John Fareham now has a chance to get back onto Hull council rather more quickly than he might have expected, as a result of a rather controversial by-election.  Sarah Harper-Riches, as she now is, gave birth to her first child earlier this year; a combination of this and ME means that she had not attended a meeting of the council since the start of the year, and in August she was disqualified under the six-month non-attendance rule.

The local press coverage of this disqualification simmers with a sense of unfairness, and Harper-Riches has clearly been badly let down both by the council and by the city's Labour group.  The council have no discretion in her disqualification - the rules are what they are - but the Labour group could have avoided this by-election by praoctively keeping tabs on the attendance of their councillors and applying for leave of absence for Harper-Riches before the six monthe ran out.  Instead of which, it appears that Labour lazily assumed the council would proactively warn Harper-Riches about her attendance instead; this would also have been a good idea, but Hull council are not obliged to do this.  As a result of this failure by anybody involved to be proactive, the retusning officer for Hull now has a by-election to organise at a rather large cost to the city's council-tax payers.

Defending the Bricknell by-election for Labour is local resident Sharon Hofman.  For the Conservatives, John Fareham is seeking to get back the seat which he lost last year.  Also standing are Kevin Paulson for the Green Party, Lucy Lennon for the Lib Dems (who have a majority on the city council, but finished fourth and last here in 2022), and James Steele for the regionalist Yorkshire Party.

<h2>Girvan and South Carrick</h2>

South Ayrshire council, Scotland; caused by the resignation of Scottish National Party councillor Peter Henderson.

Let's finish by travelling north of the border.  We've come to the southernmost ward of Ayrshire, which covers a very large and sparsely-populated area.  The only settlement here of any size is Girvan, a small fishing port and minor seaside resort on the coast of the Firth of Clyde with a population of a little over 6,000.

Fishing isn't the main industry here now: the town's main export is instead alcohol from the very large Girvan distillery, which makes Grant's blended whisky and Hendrick's gin.  For non-alcoholics, Nestlé's have a factory here which makes milk chocolate crumb; this is shipped to England where it's turned into KitKats, Yorkie bars and other Nestlé chocolate brands.  Girvan's tourist trade is dwarfed by the traffic passing through: the town is located on the main road and railway line from Glasgow to the Northern Ireland ferries at Cairnryan, and with no bypass here the road goes straight through the town centre.

The large rural area around Girvan is the southern end of the former earldom of Carrick, which was founded in the twelfth century and is still going today: since 1469 the heir to the Scottish throne (currently Prince William) has held the lesser title of Earl of Carrick.  The earldom originally merged into the Scottish crown on the accession of Robert the Bruce, who according to legend was born a few miles north of Girvan at Turnberry Castle; history records that he was certainly raised there.

Not much remains of Turnberry Castle these days, but the golf course which surrounds it is another matter.  Turnberry golf course has hosted the Open Championship four times, in 1977, 1986, 1994 and 2009; the first Open here is remembered for the so-called Duel in the Sun, in which Tom Watson eventually defeated Jack Nicklaus by one stroke.

It could be a very long time before we get scenes like that at Turnberry again.  In 2014 the course fell into the hands of Donald Trump, who is not a popular figure within the R&A - the governing body which organises the Open.  For some years thereafter the R&A found excuses not to hold the Open at Turnberry again, but after the storming of the US Capitol in 2021 the governing body came clean and stated in so many words that Turnberry would not host any R&A championship while it is still linked to Trump.  Good on them.

The reason there is a golf course at Turnberry in the first place is down to the local squire, the third Marquess of Ailsa, who owned the stately home of Culzean Castle a few miles further up the coast.  This eighteenth century country house used to appear on the Royal Bank of Scotland's £5 notes, and has been immortalised in film as the castle of Lord Summerisle in <em>The Wicker Man</em>.  It also has links to a former US President: the fifth Marquess of Ailsa donated Culzean Castle to the National Trust for Scotland in 1945, on condition that they kept an apartment free in the castle for the use of General Dwight Eisenhower.  Ike stayed here on a number of occasions, including once while he was US president.

The Marquess of Ailsa takes his title from and still owns Ailsa Craig, a rocky island in the Firth of Clyde located about ten miles west of Girvan.  Ailsa Craig is a sanctuary for birds with no permanent human population, although people do come here from the mainland every so often for the purpose of quarrying: the island's granite is of such high quality that it is one of only two locations in the world where curling stnoes are sourced from.  (The other location is Trefor Quarry, in Wales.)

Girvan and South Carrick ward elects three South Ayrshire councillors.  The current ward boundaries date from 2017, and both South Ayrshire council elections here since then have returned independent candidate Alex Clark at the top of the poll, the SNP's Peter Henderson and one councillor for the Conservatives; in 2022 that was Gavin Scott, who defeated his running-mate Linda Kane for the final seat by just 19 votes.  First preferences here in 2022 were 31% for Clark, 28% for the two Conservative candidates and 25% for the SNP.

The SNP are defending this by-election from third place, after Peter Henderson retired from the council on health grounds at the end of June.  He had represented this ward since 2017, and was leader of the council going into the 2022 election at the head of a coalition with Labour and independent councillors; a renewal of this coalition could not be negotiated after the election, and the Conservatives took control of South Ayrshire as a minority administration.  The Tories are the largest party on the council: the current composition has 10 Conservatives, 8 SNP councillors plus this vacancy, 5 Labour and 4 independents.

Defending for the SNP is Joseph McLaughlin, who is a community education worker.  There is no independent candidate this time so Alex Clark's votes are up for grabs.  Last time round the SNP did best out of Clark's surplus, but this may be counteracted by Unionist transfers lining up behind the Conservative candidate Alan Lamont, who is a former policeman.  Also hoping to make it to the top spot are Nicola Saxton for Labour, Denise Sommerville for the Alba party and Jamie Ross for the Liberal Democrats.  This is a Scottish local by-election, so Votes at 16 and the Alternative Vote will be in operation: please rank the candidates on your ballot paper in order of preference.
