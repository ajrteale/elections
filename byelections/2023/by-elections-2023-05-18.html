<h2>Northern Ireland</h2>
</p><p>
We've already had the main course of the 2023 British local elections, with 230 district and borough councils in England going to the polls on 4th May.  Two weeks later we now come to the dessert course, as this column pops over the Irish Sea to cover the local elections in Northern Ireland.
</p><p>
This is only the second piece Andrew's Previews has written on Northern Ireland.  I'd like to think that cowardice isn't the reason for this, but when all's said and done I am a resident of Great Britain and thus, you might think, probably not qualified to comment on Northern Irish politics.  This is probably a fair assessment; but your columnist has at least been to the Six Counties once, as part of a military band at the invitation of the British Army.  (We played a concert at Lisburn barracks which was attended by a number of the mayors and other ceremonial figures in Northern Irish local government.  I vividly remember coming back into the room after the concert to pack our kit away and finding our crazy drummer deep in conversation with the then Lord-Lieutenant of County Antrim, who was a lovely woman.)  That's more visits than I've made to many of the parts of England which appear in this column on a regular basis.  On that basis, let's dive in...
</p><p>
<h4>Northern Ireland's local government: a short history</h4>
</p><p>
Rather than looking forward, what I'll do with this piece is to summarise where Northern Ireland's councils stand right now.  This involves looking back a little bit in history to explain the differences between local government in Northern Ireland and in Great Britain.  We'll join the action in 1910, when the whole of Ireland was part of the UK and there was a political crisis over the water.  The Liberals were in power at the House of Commons in Westminster, but Lloyd George's 1909 budget had been rejected by the Tory-dominated House of Lords.  The Prime Minister Herbert Asquith called a general election for January 1910, which resulted in a hung parliament with Irish Nationalist MPs holding the balance of power.  A second general election in December 1910 produced essentially the same result.
</p><p>
The price for the Irish Nationalists to keep the Liberal government in power was Home Rule for Ireland.  Despite the prospect that this might provoke civil war, a Home Rule Bill was eventually passed by Parliament and it received Royal Assent in September 1914.  By that point the First World War had broken out, and implementation of Home Rule was postponed until after the war on the grounds that it would all be over by Christmas.  It wasn't.
</p><p>
By the time the war was over there was no chance of implementing Home Rule as originally planned.  The Easter Rising of 1916 had led to a huge rise in Republican sentiment in Ireland, and at the 1918 general election Sinn Féin virtually swept the board in the counties which now form the Republic of Ireland.
</p><p>
Rather like what happened in Scotland at the 2015 Westminster election when the Scottish National Party virtually swept the board, in vote terms Sinn Féin's victory wasn't as impressive as the seat count suggested.  Most of the Irish constituencies had been uncontested, and in those seats where a poll did take place the aggregate vote for Sinn Féin was just under 50%.
</p><p>
The British government pounced on this, and hoped to illustrate that Sinn Féin's support on the island was not quite as monolithic as it might appear.  To show this, the electoral system for Irish local elections was changed to proportional representation.  Electoral reform was slightly in vogue at the time: the 1918 general election had seen PR brought in for the University seats in the House of Commons, and the 1918 contest between four candidates for the two Dublin University MPs was the first PR election in Ireland.  The specific electoral system chosen was the Single Transferable Vote.
</p><p>
Elections at all levels in the Republic of Ireland have used the Single Transferable Vote ever since.  The pilot scheme was an extraordinary election for Sligo Corporation held in January 1919, which returned eight councillors for the local ratepayers' association, 7 Sinn Féiners, 5 independent and 4 Labour councillors - a good fit for the first preference votes of 37% for the ratepayers and 31% for Sinn Féin.  STV was then implemented throughout the 32 counties at the ordinary Irish local elections of 1920, the first to be held after the war.
</p><p>
Proportional representation became entrenched in the south of Ireland, but it didn't stick in the North.  The partition of 1922 brought into being the new polity of Northern Ireland, with a permanent Protestant/Unionist majority and sizeable Catholic/Nationalist minority.  Pretty much ever since then, elections in the Six Counties have been primarily sectarian headcounts.  The Protestants and Unionists quickly moved to consolidate their power, and one of the ways in which they did this was to abolish PR for Northern Irish local government.  The Stormont Parliament, whose first two elections were held under PR, then moved to first-past-the-post in single-member constituencies from the 1929 election.
</p><p>
Northern Ireland has now been in existence for 101 years, and its history has many black spots.  Quite a lot of these relate to local government, where the Unionist advantage was initially perpetuated by a large number of electoral dirty tricks.  Gerrymandering was rife, most notoriously in the case of Londonderry county borough whose Catholic majority population was packed into a few supersafe wards to enable permanent control by the Unionist minority.  Even the franchise itself was manipulated.  In Northern Irish local elections, with very few exceptions, only property owners or tenants and their spouses were normally eligible to vote; if you were an adult child living with your parents, a lodger, a sub-tenant or a servant, you had no voice.  The sectarian nature of elections meant that a local authority knew it was pretty much guaranteeing two Unionist votes in a particular ward if it gave a council house to a Protestant family.  Thus anti-Catholic discrimination in politics fed through into other areas like housing or employment.  It's not an accident that many of the complaints of the 1960s civil rights marchers related to local government.
</p><p>
Even the Stormont Parliament felt it had to act eventually.  Local government reorganisation was all the rage in the rest of the UK in the early 1970s, and the Northern Irish government produced a plan to sweep away the old system of counties, county boroughs and urban and rural districts in favour of twenty-six unitary councils.  By the time the British government imposed direct rule, a set of single-member wards had been drawn up for the first elections to the new structure, which were intended to take place in 1973 using first-past-the-post.
</p><p>
When the Heath government in Westminster took over, it recognised it had to accede to the demands of the civil rights protesters and reintroduce proportional representation.  The single-member wards were grouped together to form District Electoral Areas returning five, six or seven councillors, and the 1973 local elections went ahead using the Single Transferable Vote.
</p><p>
Fifty years on, the 1973 structure of local government has been swept away but the use of the Single Transferable Vote in 5-7 member District Electoral Areas is still with us.  Following a 2014 reform Northern Ireland now has eleven local government districts and a total of eighty DEAs: ten for the city of Belfast, and seven each for the other ten councils.
</p><p>
Since 2011 Northern Ireland has generally avoided council by-elections and instead fills vacancies on its councils by co-option.  The party which the retiring councillor was elected for is asked to nominate a new councillor to serve in their stead, while independent councillors get to file a list of substitutes in order of preference.  Only once in the last twelve years has this process broken down and forced a by-election, when an independent Mid and East Antrim councillor died in 2018 and none of his three substitutes were willing or able to serve; this forced a by-election in the Carrick Castle DEA, held in October 2018.  The same co-option system is used to fill vacancies in the Northern Ireland Assembly, as we saw last year when the DUP leader and newly-elected MLA Sir Jeffrey Donaldson immediately resigned his Stormont seat in order to stay in the Westminster parliament and avoid forcing a parliamentary by-election.  You can see details of co-options as they happen on the website of the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland.
</p><p>
<h4>The party system</h4>
</p><p>
I said earlier that elections in Northern Ireland are sectarian headcounts, but the days when there were hegemonic Unionist and Nationalist Parties are long gone.  There's a lot of choice for voters at both ends of the political spectrum, and this political fragmentation is reflected by Sinn Féin placing first in last year's Stormont election with just 29% of the first preference vote.
</p><p>
On the nationalist side, Sinn Féin - who are now respectable enough that their Stormont leader can attend the coronation of a British king with hardly a murmur of protest - have clearly supplanted the more moderate and middle-class Social Democratic and Labour Party (whose MPs do turn up to Westminster, and normally take the Labour whip).  Those two parties mop up the vast majority of the Catholic vote, and the only other Nationalist councillors in Northern Ireland are a number of independents and one elected member of Aontú, a socially-conservative group which started off as a Sinn Féin splinter and contests elections on both sides of the border.
</p><p>
Things are more complicated on the Unionist side.  The major players here are the Democratic Unionist Party, who were the largest party in the Stormont Assembly and supplied the First Minister from 2007 to 2022; and the Ulster Unionist Party, which used to be the natural party of government in the Six Counties and hasn't yet worked out how to get that status back.  Minor players include the Traditional Unionist Voice, which thinks that the DUP have gone soft by entering power-sharing government, and the Progressive Unionist Party which has links to loyalist paramilitary groups and is unusually left-wing for a Unionist party.  The PUP have not been represented in Stormont since 2011 but do still have a few councillors, mostly in Belfast.  Also under this heading we have the Northern Ireland branch of the Conservative party, which stands a few candidates here and there but lost their last council seats in 2001.
</p><p>
In between the two old blocs we have a third political front: the "Other" parties of Stormont, which are mostly centrist groups.  The main players here are the Alliance Party, whose policies are not that dissimilar to the Liberal Democrats across the water.  Other Others include the Green Party of Northern Ireland and the People Before Profit Alliance, who sit slightly uneasily in this bloc: although People Before Profit designate as an "other" party in Stormont, in practice their voters are overwhelmingly Catholic and their councillors are elected in strongly-Nationalist areas of Belfast and Derry/Londonderry.
</p><p>
The transferable vote system means that despite this political fragmentation, the Unionist, Nationalist and Other blocs will normally end up with a number of seats which reflects the relative strength of each bloc - there's less risk of multiple parties splitting the vote for one side and letting someone else come through the middle to win.  Unionist voters will overwhelmingly transfer to other Unionist candidates if their first preference vote is redistributed, and Nationalist voters will overwhelmingly transfer to other Nationalist candidates.
</p><p>
<h4>What happened last time</h4>
</p><p>
The last local elections in Northern Ireland were held in May 2019, at the height of the Brexit wars.  Rather like the May 2019 local elections in England which I covered a couple of weeks back, there was an anti-incumbent mood about.  All of the Unionist parties lost council seats nett, as did the SDLP, while Sinn Féin came out with no net change in their tally of councillors; the big winners were the parties of the centre, with the Alliance Party going up from 32 councillors to 53 (out of a possible 462) and the Greens doubling their representation to eight councillors.  Independent candidates also did well.
</p><p>
The trend of centrist parties gaining at the expense of the old blocs has continued since 2nd May 2019.  Three weeks afterwards the Alliance Party won their first and last seat in the European Parliament, gaining the seat previously held by the Ulster Unionist Party.  The Stormont elections in May 2022 produced another chamber without a Unionist majority: there are 37 Unionist MLAs (25 DUP, 9 UUP, 1 TUV and two independents), 35 Nationalists (27 Sinn Féin and 8 SDLP) and 18 Others (17 Alliance Party and one People Before Profit Alliance).
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/ni-belfast.png" alt="Belfast" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
The only one of the eleven local councils where the parties of the centre also hold the balance of power between Unionism and Nationalism is the city of <b>Belfast</b>, where the 2019 elections returned 24 nationalist councillors (18 Sinn Féin and 6 SDLP), 19 unionists (15 DUP, 2 each for the UUP and the Progressive Unionist Party) and 17 councillors who identify for "other" parties at Stormont (10 Alliance Party, 4 Greens and 3 People Before Profit Alliance).
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/ni-ards-n-down.png" alt="Ards/N Down" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
The "other" bloc have one Westminster MP, the Alliance's Stephen Farry who gained the North Down constituency from a retiring independent unionist in December 2019.  The North Down constituency is almost entirely contained within the borough of <b>Ards and North Down</b>, whose largest town is Bangor; also here are the town of Newtownards, the Ards peninsula on the far side of Strangford Lough, and the affluent Belfast suburb of Holywood.  This is the weakest part of the Province for the Nationalist parties, who have just one councillor here (for the SDLP in the Ards Peninsula DEA); the 2019 local elections returned a Unionist majority with 14 DUP, 8 UUP and 1 TUV councillor against 10 Alliance, 3 Greens and 3 independents.  That's the bare bones of what's happening here: for a deep dive into this year's Ards and North Down election, may I point to you to <a href="https://scriptomanic.wordpress.com/2023/05/14/2022-north-down-and-ards-borough-council-an-election-preview/">this wonderful preview by "notthathunter" (link)</a>.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/ni-lisburn-castlereagh.png" alt="Lisburn/Castlereagh" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Ards and North Down is one of the three council areas which border Belfast.  To the south of that city can be found another city council: <b>Lisburn and Castlereagh</b>, which is based on the city of Lisburn and the former Castlereagh district to the south-east of Belfast.  Much of this area is covered by Sir Jeffrey Donaldson's Lagan Valley constituency.  Appropriately enough this was the strongest DUP council in May 2019, with 26 Unionist councillors (15 DUP and 11 UUP), 4 Nationalists (2 SF and 2 SDLP) and 10 others (9 Alliance and 1 Green).  Alliance will be looking for gains here after they won a second seat in Lagan Valley at the Stormont election last year.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/ni-antrim-newtownabbey.png" alt="Antrim/Newtownabbey" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
North of Belfast we find the borough of <b>Antrim and Newtownabbey</b>, which runs from the shores of Belfast Lough to Lough Neagh and also takes in Aldergrove Airport and the town of Ballyclare.  Again the DUP are the largest party here: there are 23 Unionists (14 DUP and 9 UUP), 9 Nationalists (5 SF and 4 SDLP), 7 Alliance and an independent.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/ni-m-e-antrim.png" alt="M/E Antrim" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
The most Unionist of the eleven local councils is the borough of <b>Mid and East Antrim</b>, which includes the towns of Ballymena and Carrickfergus together with the front line of the Irish Sea border: the ferry port of Larne.  This is the strongest district for Traditional Unionist Voice, five of whose six councillors were elected here; the TUV's leader and only MLA Jim Allister represents the North Antrim constituency, which includes Ballymena.  Overall 27 of the 40 councillors here are Unionists (15 DUP, 7 UUP and 5 TUV) against 7 Alliance, 3 independents and 3 Nationalists (2 SF and 1 SDLP).
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/ni-causeway-coast-glens.png" alt="Causeway Coast/Glens" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
The remainder of County Antrim, together with most of the East Londonderry constituency, are covered by the <b>Causeway Coast and Glens</b> borough: this is a large rural area which stretches along Northern Ireland's north coast.  The major town here is Coleraine, with other centres including Limavady and Ballymoney; also here is the tourist trap of the Giant's Causeway and the golfing centre of Portrush.  Here there are 22 Unionist councillors (14 DUP, 7 UUP and 1 PUP), 15 Nationalists (9 SF and 6 SDLP), 2 Alliance and an independent.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/ni-abc.png" alt="Armagh City/Banbridge/Craigavon" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
The last local council with a Unionist majority is on the southern shore of Lough Neagh: the borough of <b>Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon</b>.  Despite the order of the names, and Armagh's city status, the main population centre here is made up of the New Town of Craigavon and its older satellite towns of Portadown and Lurgan.  This urban area is also the centre of the Upper Bann constituency, which is represented at Stormont by the UUP leader Doug Beattie.  ABC Council has a narrow majority of 21 Unionist councillors (11 DUP and 10 UUP) against 16 Nationalists (10 SF and 6 SDLP), 3 Alliance and an independent.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/ni-newry-mourne-down.png" alt="Newry/Mourne/Down" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
The remaining four councils have Nationalist majorities.  The strongest local council for the Nationalist parties is the district of <b>Newry, Mourne and Down</b>, which is centred on the Mountains of Mourne; it stretches east along the southern coast of County Down to Strangford Lough, and west to take in the border city of Newry and its hinterland.  Newry is the main population centre, with Downpatrick being the only other town of any size.  This district has 27 Nationalist councillors (16 SF and 11 SDLP), 7 Unionists (4 UUP and 3 DUP), 5 independents and 2 Alliance councillors.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/ni-m-ulster.png" alt="M Ulster" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Further along the border we come to <b>Mid Ulster</b> district, which runs along the western shore of Lough Neagh.  It has rather different boundaries to the Mid Ulster parliamentary seat represented at Stormont by Sinn Féin's First Minister-designate Michelle O'Neill; the towns of Cookstown and Magherafelt are within her constituency, but the district's largest centre of population is Dungannon which is part of a different constituency with a very famous history, Fermanagh and South Tyrone.  Mid Ulster district council has 23 Nationalist councillors (17 SF and 6 SDLP), 15 Unionists (9 DUP and 6 UUP) and 2 independents; this is the only council area where the Alliance Party are not represented.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/ni-fermanagh-omagh.png" alt="Fermanagh/Omagh" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
To the south-west we have the large and sparsely-populated rural area of <b>Fermanagh and Omagh</b> district, whose main towns are Omagh and Enniskillen.  Sinn Féin topped the poll in all seven DEAs here four years ago and are clearly the largest party on the council, but on a community basis the district is finely balanced: there are 20 Nationalist councillors (15 SF and 5 SDLP), 14 Unionists (9 UUP and 5 DUP), 4 independents, 1 Alliance and one councillor in Enniskillen for the Cross-Community Labour Alternative.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/ni-derry-strabane.png" alt="Derry/Strabane" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Finally we come to the western end of Northern Ireland and the district of <b>Derry City and Strabane</b>, which is based on the city of Derry/Londonderry but also takes in a large rural area to its south in western Tyrone, around the border town of Strabane.  The constituency covering the city (which has the neutral name of Foyle) is held at Westminster by the SDLP leader Colum Eastwood, and the nationalist majority of 22 councillors is evenly-divided between 11 SDLP and 11 SF councillors; there are also 9 Unionists (7 DUP and 2 UUP), 4 independents, 2 People Before Profit Alliance, 2 Alliance Party and an Aontú councillor.
</p><p>
<h4>What to look out for</h4>
</p><p>
Those readers who followed the English local elections two weeks ago will recall that we saw some rather wild changes in the number of councillors for each party.  That's because English local elections do not use proportional representation, in which not just the total number of seats but also the <em>seat changes</em> are commensurate with the votes polled.  Once the tally of Northern Ireland's 462 local councillors is known, whether late on Friday or at some point over the weekend, the seat changes might look rather small to those who are used to the outsize lurches of England's first-the-post-system; but that doesn't mean that they aren't significant changes.
</p><p>
Uniquely in the UK, the electoral process in Northern Ireland is not run by local government.  Electoral registration and ID cards, and organisation of the election process, are handled centrally by the Electoral Office of Northern Ireland, and its head - the Chief Electoral Officer for Northern Ireland - is the returning officer for all polls.
</p><p>
Proportional representation was introduced in 2007 for Scottish local elections, where the ballot papers with their lists of preferences are scanned into a computer which then performs the necessary counting and redistributions of votes in an instant.  By contrast, Northern Ireland has always counted Single Transferable Vote elections by hand and has no plans to change that.  This process takes a while, and the speed of the count is the reason why these polls have been delayed by two weeks from the default date of Thursday 4th May.  The risk that unusually close or complicated counts could spill over into the weekend, and potentially clash with Charles III's coronation, was seen as too great a risk to take.
</p><p>
The count for these elections will start on Friday morning, and will probably take all day if not longer.  In order to win a seat a candidate needs to get 12.5% of the vote in a 7-seat DEA, more in a 5- or 6-seat area; the most popular candidates will often manage this on first preferences alone, while those who perform less well in the initial count will need to see if they can attract transfers from elected candidates or from worse-performing candidates in order to reach the magic number.  As the count rolls on, the lowest-placed candidates will be eliminated from the bottom up, and their votes redistributed, until a result is reached.  Be wary of reading too much into the first preference counts, because surprising things can and do happen when the transfers start to flow.
</p><p>
The new councillors elected today will have to navigate another choppy period in the volatile waters of Northern Ireland's politics.  Yet again, the Stormont institutions are not functioning; the Democratic Unionist Party are not happy with the Brexit they wanted and they refuse to join in power-sharing, and serve under a Sinn Féin First Minister, while there remains a customs border in the Irish Sea.  In the meantime Northern Ireland's governance continues to stagnate, and it's the local councils who will have to deal with the power vacuum from above while trying to deliver their services and solve the day-to-day issues of their communities.  We can only hope that they will continue to be equal to that task.
