One by-election on Wednesday 6th September 2023:
</p><p>
<h2>Ashford Town</h2>
</p><p>
Spelthorne council, Surrey; caused by the resignation of Green Party councillor Andrew McLuskey.
</p><p>
Yes, it's a Wednesday.  So why not have a by-election?  There's no rule that says by-elections have to be held on the traditional Thursday; any working day will do, and Spelthorne council - which tends to schedule its full council meetings on Thursdays - seems have got into a habit of holding its council by-elections on Wednesdays.

</p><p>
So it is we kick the traditional busy time of autumn off in Ashford, in the county of Surrey.  Or is it?  The Spelthorne local government district is the only part of Surrey which lies north of the River Thames; historically it was thus part of the county of Middlesex, until Middlesex ceased to exist in local government with the creation of Greater London in 1965.  Spelthorne was one of the few areas of Middlesex which escaped becoming part of Greater London, and seemingly for want of better ideas it then became part of Surrey.
</p><p>
This change of county hasn't been accepted by everyone, and unfortunately that creates a lot of confusion because of the need to disambiguate this Ashford from the larger and more important town in Kent with the same name.  To take a couple of examples, the local railway station (on the Waterloo-Staines line) appears in the National Rail timetable with the name "Ashford (Surrey)", while the local non-league football team (who play in the Isthmian League South Central Division, four levels below the EFL) are registered with the FA as "Ashford Town (Middlesex)".  Royal Mail have basically given up on counties these days and just tell letter-writers to use the postcode instead.  No doubt this confusion warms the heart of the Lord of the Manor of Ashford Russell Grant, the well-known TV astrologer, who bought that title in the 1990s a few years after he founded the Association of British Counties.
</p><p>
The Surrey/Middlesex Ashford may have escaped being absorbed by Greater London, but it still lies within the M25 motorway and is very much part of the capital's urban sprawl, about a mile or two to the east of Staines.  The census return paints a picture of a lower middle-class area whose economy is heavily dependent on Heathrow Airport to the north: Ashford Town ward is within the top 60 wards in England and Wales for those working in the transport or storage sector (12.8%) and in the top 75 wards for what the ONS class as "intermediate" occupations (16.2%).  The ward takes in the town centre and lies mostly to the south of the railway line: this means that within the ward boundary is HMP Bronzefield, which is the largest women's prison in Europe with capacity to hold over 500 of the UK's most notorious female prisoners.
</p><p>
The local authority here is Spelthorne council which, Russell Grant notwithstanding, is a district under Surrey county council.  As this column has related on a few previous occasions, Spelthorne council has had a lot of political instability over the last few years as a result of the majority Conservative group elected in 2019 suffering a damaging split.  We're probably in for more of the same in this term, after the May 2023 Spelthorne elections returned a very balanced council.  The Tories remain the largest party, but are now well short of a majority with just 12 seats against 10 Lib Dems, 8 independents, 7 Labour and 3 Greens.
</p><p>
A coalition of the Lib Dems and the independent councillors is now running the show under an independent leader, and that coalition is hopefully starting to get to grips with the council's large property portfolio.  Spelthorne is one of those councils that did a lot of property speculation in the last decade, in their case focusing their investments on large office and commercial buildings within the borough and the surrounding area - the council's largest asset is the extensive BP office complex in Sunbury, on the books at over £380 million.  The upside of this is that the council has a very healthy rental income; the downside is that they are servicing £1,000 million in debt, and with recent interest rate rises it remains to be seen whether this will be sustainable in the long-term.
</p><p>
Ashford Town used to be part of the borough's Conservative majority.  The current ward boundaries date from 2003, and the Tories got their full slate in at all of the elections from 2003 to 2019 with the exception of 2011, when the Conservative slate was opposed only by a single independent candidate who topped the poll.  Things changed in May 2023, when the ward's three seats split three ways: independent candidate Michelle Arnold topped the poll with 29% of the vote, the Tories held just one of their seats with 26%, and the third seat went to the Green Party with 24%.  The other 21% went to Labour.
</p><p>
The ward is split roughly evenly between two divisions of Surrey county council.  At the last county elections in 2021 Ashford division was gained from the Conservatives by independent candidate Joanne Sexton, who is now the leader of Spelthorne council; while the Staines South and Ashford West division remained in Conservative hands.  The Conservative MP here since 2010 has been the <em>University Challenge</em> champion Kwasi Kwarteng, whose disastrous five-and-a-half weeks as Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Truss government will not be forgotten for a while.
</p><p>
This fascinating ward will be defended in the by-election by the third-placed Green Party.  Their councillor Andrew McLuskey lasted longer in office than Kwarteng's chancellorship, but not much longer; by the time his resignation letter went in at the end of July he had already quit the council's Green group and was sitting as an Independent Green.
</p><p>
Defending for the Green Party is Stuart Whitmore, a retired fireman who appeared in this column last year: he was elected to Spelthorne council in a May 2022 by-election for Laleham and Shepperton Green ward (<em>Andrew's Previews 2022</em>, page 224), but lost re-election in that ward in May as the Conservatives took his seat back.  The council's independent group have firmly endorsed independent candidate John Enright, who fought Ashford East ward in May and is retired after a career in public sector finance-related roles; a gain for him would improve the position of the ruling Independent-Lib Dem coalition, which is currently two seats short of a council majority.  The Conservatives have reselected Paul Woodward, who was one of their two losing candidates here in May.  Also returning from May is Labour candidate Mark Kluth, who currently works as a manager for a railway firm.  Two other candidates complete an all-male ballot paper: they are Paul Couchman for the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition and Rory O'Brien for Reform UK.
