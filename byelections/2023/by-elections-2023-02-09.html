<h2>Rhyl Tŷ Newydd</h2>

Denbighshire council, North Wales; caused by the death of Labour councillor Brian Blakeley.

For the five council by-elections taking place today we'll take a circular tour of England and Wales, in an anticlockwise direction.  That brings us first to the coast of North Wales and to the largest town in the Denbighshire council.  No, it's not Denbigh.

Welcome to Sunny Rhyl.  North Wales is not short of seaside resorts: Llandudno, Colwyn Bay and Rhyl basically exist to serve the tastes of the British holidaymaker as they were a century.  Llandudno and Colwyn have the benefits of a rather dramatic landscape for those whose tastes don't extend to sunbathing (in warmer conditions than we have at the moment); Rhyl, by contrast, is located on flat ground close to the mouth of the River Conwy.  Socially, it's quite a step down from Llandudno in particular, and in the 2008 Welsh indices of multiple deprivation Rhyl West ward was right at the top.

<em>Tŷ Newydd</em> is the Welsh for "new house", and the ward of that name certainly has a few newish houses on the eastern edge of Rhyl.  This is an inland ward, running between the North Wales Coast railway line and the main road towards Dyserth.  The main feature of the ward is Rhyl High School, one of two secondary schools in the town; this has been educating pupils since the nineteenth century, and a number of politicians have been educated here; possibly the most notable of them was Lord Williams of Mostyn, who served as Attorney-General and Leader of the Lords in the Blair administration.

Another former pupil here was Ann Jones, who until recently represented Rhyl in the Senedd as the Labour MS for the Vale of Clwyd constituency.  Jones retired in 2021 and her seat was gained by the Conservatives with a majority of 366 seats.  The Vale of Clwyd was the only Senedd constituency which the Conservatives gained from Labour in 2021, and that followed a good Conservative performance across North Wales in the 2019 Westminster election.  Tory MP James Davies has a majority of 1,827 votes in a constituency which has been very marginal in recent years.

Local elections in Wales often tell a different story to the national picture.  The local authority here is Denbighshire council, which runs southward from Rhyl and Prestatyn along the Clwyd valley and on to Llangollen.  This varied physical and political area has been under no overall control since the current council was created in 1996, but since 2007 the council had been led by independent councillor Hugh Evans.  This despite the fact that the Conservatives were the largest party on the council after the 2017 Welsh local elections, with sixteen councillors.

2022 was generally not a good local election cycle for the Welsh Conservatives, and this extended to Denbighshire too.  Labour are now the largest party on the council after winning 19 seats last year; there are 12 independent councillors, 8 from Plaid Cymru, just six Conservatives, two Greens and a Lib Dem.  Labour have taken over the council leadership, and now run Denbighshire in alliance with Plaid.

Ward boundary changes had added an extra councillor to Denbighshire, and that addition came in this corner of Rhyl.  The former ward of Rhyl South East, which had previously had three councillors, was divided into two new wards called Rhyl Tŷ Newydd and Rhyl Trellewelyn with two councillors each.  In this century Rhyl South East had often been closely fought between the Conservatives and Labour, and at the 2017 election here the ward's three seats split two to Labour and one to the Conservatives.  All three outgoing councillors sought re-election last year in Rhyl Tŷ Newydd; with only two seats available, somebody was going to lose out and in the end it was the Conservative councillor who lost his seat.  A straight fight between the two parties resulted in a win for the Labour slate by 59-41.

This by-election follows the death of long-serving Labour councillor Brian Blakeley, who was first elected to Rhyl South East ward in a 2003 by-election.  He was 82 years old.  Blakeley had served as chair of the council in 2014-15, and was also Mayor of Rhyl in 2006-07.

Defending this by-election for Labour is the current deputy mayor of Rhyl, Jacquie McAlpine, who is also kept busy as a business owner, law student and single mum.  Former Conservative councillor and Denbighshire cabinet member Brian Jones, who lost his seat here in 2022, is trying to get back on the council.  There's a lot more choice this time for the local voters, with three other candidates standing: Plaid Cymru's John Hughes-Jones, the Lib Dems' Keith Kirwan, and independent candidate Simon Rowlands.

<h2>Battledown</h2>

Cheltenham council, Gloucestershire; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Louis Savage.

Our first Conservative defence this week can be found on the eastern edge of Cheltenham.  The Battledown estate is a very wealthy enclave of the town which has seen a lot of new housing developed in this century, with more to come as Oakley Farm is redeveloped with 250 houses.  This might not help the cause of affordable housing in the town, because Battledown ward contains some of Cheltenham's most expensive housing.

We can see this very clearly in Battledown ward's 2011 census return, in which 32% of the workforce were in "lower managerial, administrative and professional occupations"; that was the highest figure for any ward in the South West and in the top 75 wards across England and Wales.

We can also see this demographic makeup very clearly in Battledown's local election results.  This is the safest Conservative ward in Cheltenham; indeed, in May 2022 it was the only Conservative ward in Cheltenham, with a narrow Tory lead over the Lib Dems of 46-41.  Cheltenham council has had a Liberal Democrat majority since 2010.  The Conservative lead in the parliamentary seat, which is slightly smaller than the borough, was under 1,000 votes in 2019.

This by-election follows the resignation in December of Conservative councillor Louis Savage, who stood down to concentrate on his employment as an NHS doctor.  He was first elected at a by-election in May 2015.

Defending for the Conservatives is Marcia Jacko, a former teacher who has lived in the area for 35 years.  The Lib Dem candidate is Ed Chidley, who returns from last year's election.  Also standing are Ian Cameron for the Greens and Caroline Gavin for Labour.

<h2>Hitchin North</h2>

Hertfordshire county council; caused by the death of Labour councillor Judi Billing.

We now strike north again along the East Coast Main Line.  This has a major junction at Hitchin, where northbound trains can turn right towards Cambridge or continue straight on for the north.  This flat junction was a major bottleneck on the line, but this was eased in 2013 with the opening of a flyover which took Cambridge-bound trains away from interfering with southbound expresses.

Hitchin is also the main town in the North Hertfordshire local government district, which is currently hung.  The latest composition has 19 Conservative councillors, 16 Labour plus this vacancy and 13 Lib Dems; Labour and the Lib Dems run the conucil in coalition, and the coalition made gains here in May 2022 as the Conservatives squandered a good opportunity to take an overall majority.  In truth, that never looked likely following a county council by-election in Hitchin South in March 2022, which saw the Lib Dems hold a marginal seat with a massive majority; Labour had stood down in the Lib Dems' favour, but this doesn't explain the massive vote changes.

The Liberal Democrats are now returning the favour by standing down for the Hitchin North by-election.  This is a safe Labour ward which has been represented since 2013 by Judi Billing.  Billing, who passed away in November at the age of 71, spent more than half her life in local government; she was first elected to North Hertfordshire council in 1980, and she was appointed MBE in 2015 for services to local government.  At the time of her death, she was the leader of the Labour group on Hertfordshire county council.

Judi Billing was re-elected for her third and final county council term in 2021, holding Hitchin North by a 52-27 margin over the Conservatives.  The ward roughly corresponds to the Hitchin Bearton and Hitchin Walsworth wards of North Hertfordshire council, which are both safe Labour wards and together returned a 50-20 lead over the Conservatives in 2022.  Billing also represented Hitchin Bearton ward on the district council; she was due for re-election there in May, so her district council seat is being left vacant until then and this by-election is for her county council seat only.

Defending for Labour is Ian Albert, who also represents Hitchin Bearton ward on the district council; he is North Hertfordshire's cabinet member for finance.  The Conservative candidate is Ralph Muncer, who is also a North Hertfordshire councillor (representing Kimpton ward).  Also standing are Deolinda Eltringham for the Greens and Leigh Smith for the Christian Peoples Alliance.

<h2>Masham and Fountains</h2>

North Yorkshire county council; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Margaret Atkinson.

We finish for the week in some of the most gorgeous countryside you can find that isn't in a National Park - although this ward does have a boundary with the Yorkshire Dales National Park.  This is a very, very beautiful part of the world.

Countryside doesn't get much more beautiful than the Studley Royal estate, which in 1986 was one of the first six places in the UK to be desginated as a World Heritage Site.  (The other five were the Giant's Causeway, Durham Cathedral, Ironbridge Gorge, "Stonehenge, Avebury and Associated Sites", and "Castles and Town Walls of King Edward in Gwynedd".)  Studley Royal is one of the best-preserved landscape gardens of the 18th century, and this owes a lot to one of the largest and most notorious corruption scandals ever to hit UK politics.  Your modern-day hate figure of choice has nothing on the actions of John Aislabie.

Aislabie, who inherited the Studley Royal estate in 1693, quickly rose up the greasy pole.  He was elected to Parliament in 1695 as an MP for Ripon, served as Mayor of Ripon in 1702-03 and paid for the obelisk which still stands in Ripon's market square.

In 1718 Aislabie became Chancellor of the Exchequer, and this is the point where we start talking serious money.  The following year Aislabie piloted through Parliament a scheme whereby the UK's national debt would be taken on by the South Sea Company, in a scheme which essentially amounted to a cash injection into the UK economy of around 7% of GDP.  The South Sea Company collapsed shortly afterwards with huge losses for much of the UK's elite, and an investigation by Parliament found that Aislabie had been given South Sea stock worth £20,000 for promoting the scheme - that's something like £3 million in today's money.  He was expelled from the Commons and the Privy Council, and spent time in the Tower of London before retiring to Studley Royal to continue the development of the gardens.

John's son William Aislabie took over his disgraced father's seat in Parliament and served as MP for Ripon for 60 years until his death in 1781, a record at the time.  In 1768 he expanded the Studley Royal estate by buying the adjacent Fountains Estate.  This included the impressive ruins of Fountains Abbey, which was founded in 1132.  In time Fountains became the UK's richest monastery thanks to its extensive landholdings in the Yorkshire Dales.

Unlike some other religious institutions, Fountains Abbey didn't spawn a town next to it.  Instead the main town in the area is Masham (pronounced Mazzem), which can be found in Wensleydale on the main road going north-west from Ripon.  Masham itself had unusual ecclesiastical arrangements: until the 19th century it was part of the diocese of York but effectively ran its own affairs as a Peculier.

Today this arrangement is commemorated in the name of the beer Old Peculier, brewed in Masham by Theakston's.  Also in Masham is the Black Sheep Brewery, founded in 1991 by a member of the Theakston family who wasn't happy with the rest of his family selling the Theakston's brewery to Scottish and Newcastle.  Both breweries' outputs are particular favourites of your columnist.

Masham has an unusual distinction in the present membership of the House of Lords.  Susan Cunliffe-Lister, the dowager Countess of Swinton, has sat in the Lords by virtue of a life peerage (Baroness Masham of Ilton) since 1970, and she is currently the longest-serving life peer.  Baroness Masham was disabled in a riding accident in 1958, but hasn't let that stop her taking a full role in life: as well as her political career, she has Paralympic gold medals to her name in swimming and table tennis.

In between Masham and Ripon can be found the theme park of Lightwater Valley.  This used to he home to <em>The Ultimate</em>, which when it opened in 1991 was the longest rollercoaster in the world at 2.26 kilometres.  It's so long that the building contractors for it were British Rail.  Unfortunately you can no longer ride <em>The Ultimate</em>; it hasn't operated since 2019, and is now being demolished.

North Yorkshire is going through local government reorganisation at the moment.  At present Masham and Fountains are part of the Harrogate local government district, which has a larger acreage than Greater London but a tiny fraction of the population.  This will be swept away in April in favour of a takeover by North Yorkshire county council, which will administer the area from closer by in Northallerton.

In preparation for this a county council election was held in North Yorkshire last year on new division boundaries, which saw Masham and Fountains ward extended to the east to take in a number of villages to the north and north-east of Ripon as far as the River Swale.  This includes Dishforth next to the A1 motorway, a military airbase currently used by the Army Air Corps.

North Yorkshire county council wasn't the only brand-new council elected in 2022 as a result of local government reorganisation.  The other three new authorities all saw a large electoral backlash against the Conservative government.  Somerset county council now has a Liberal Democrat majority, as does Westmorland and Furness; while Cumberland, a new district the Conservatives will have had strong hopes of winning, instead has a large Labour majority.  North Yorkshire county council is still run by the Conservatives, but we can also see the backlash here: the 2022 elections saw the Conservatives fall from 55 seats out of 72 to 47 seats out of 90.  If the Conservatives lose this by-election then their council majority will be down to just two seats.

Even in Masham and Fountains, normally a safely Conservative area, the party polled a minority vote.  Margaret Atkinson was re-elected with 44%, against 30% for an independent candidate and 25% for the Lib Dems.  Atkinson, who subsequently became chair of the county council, had been a North Yorkshire county councillor since 2013 and a Harrogate district councillor since 2018, representing the ward of Fountains and Ripley.  This ward will disappear at the end of next month, and the by-election following Atkinson's death in November is only for her county council seat.

Defending for the Conservatives is Brooke Hull, who will be hoping to join her husband Nathan (who represents the ward of Washburn and Birstwith) as a North Yorkshire county councillor.  In a straight fight she is opposed by the independent candidate from last year, who now has the Liberal Democrat nomination: Felicity Cunliffe-Lister, the present Countess of Swinton, owns the large Swinton Park estate within the ward and has converted the family seat of Swinton Park into a luxury hotel.  This column likes to highlight pubs which do their bit for democracy by serving as a polling stations, so a shoutout is due to The Inn in South Stainley.
