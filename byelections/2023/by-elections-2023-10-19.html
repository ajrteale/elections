<h2>Mid Bedfordshire</h2>

House of Commons; caused by the resigation of Conservative MP Nadine Dorries.

All aboard the clown car for the seventh, and possibly the most long awaited, parliamentary by-election of 2023.  And it's a complete contrast to Tamworth as we travel from town to country.

Now, the Boundary Commissions have a bit of a rule of thumb when naming parliamentary seats.  If you encounter a constituency called Mid Anyshire, then you'll often find it's a rather diffuse set of small towns and villages with little in common except that they didn't fit into the seats based on the towns of Anyborough or Newtown.  And Mid Bedfordshire is a classic of this genre.  What we have here is a collection of dozens of parishes located to the south of Bedford, the north of Luton and the west of Milton Keynes, with not much to link them together.

Indeed, there are only three settlements in the Mid Bedfordshire constituency which can properly be called towns.  The largest of these is Flitwick, with a population of slightly under 14,000.  This is located on the Midland railway line roughly halfway between Bedford and Luton, and it's the last stop before Bedford for Thameslink trains from London.  Perhaps because of the good rail link to the capital, Flitwick's population has boomed in recent years.

Just to the north of Flitwick lies the similarly-sized town of Ampthill, which is of much older vintage: Ampthill was the only part of this seat to be an Urban District before the 1970s reorganisation of local government.  This has been a market town since 1219, gaining its charter from Henry III; there was a mediaeval castle here, where Queen Catherine of Aragon lived in the 1530s and received the news that her marriage to Henry VIII was over.  Nothing remains of the castle now: its site is located with parkland.

Mid Bedfordshire's third town is Shefford, located at the eastern end of the seat.  This is another mediaeval market town, but there is also a large military presence here.  Shefford lies immediately to the north of the former airfield of RAF Henlow and immediately to the east of the major military base at Chicksands.  This has been a centre for military intelligence since the Second World War, when the site intercepted German military signals and sent them to Bletchley Park for decryption; after spending many years in the hands of the US Air Force during the Cold War, MoD Chicksands has been home to the Intelligence Corps of the British Army since 1997.  Some of the site was sold off in 2004 for use by local government, and the headquarters of Central Bedfordshire Council lie immediately outside the base's perimeter.

The southern end of this constituency consists of small villages up to the boundary with Luton; Toddington and Barton-le-Clay are the main population centres here.  In the west we have a number of villages which look towards Milton Keynes, including the Duke of Bedford's estate at Woburn which is well-known for its safari park.  In recent years the upgrading of the Ridgmont junction of the M1 motorway - which now has a fast dual-carriageway road to Bedford plugged into it - has led to a riot of distribution warehouses springing up.

Also in this general area we find Cranfield.  Originally another RAF base located in the countryside halfway between Bedford and what would become Milton Keynes, Cranfield became home in 1946 to the College of Aeronautics, which was promoted to university status in 1969.  Cranfield University is a rather curious institution.  It only admits postgraduate students, and it specialises in engineering, science and management courses.  Its student body is certainly not the group of young adults you would associate with a normal university in the UK: more than half of Cranfield's students are aged 30 or over.

The main communication links between Bedford and MK avoid Cranfield, running via lower ground to the south-east.  This is the Marston Vale, which was once one of the UK's major centres for brickworking.  In the 1970s Bedfordshire produced one in five of England's bricks, and the London Brick Company had a virtual monopoly on the area's economy: the company developed the model village of Wootton Pillinge, which was renamed in 1937 as "Stewartby" after the London Brick Company's president, Sir Percy Stewart.  Bricks were still being made at Stewartby up until 2008, when Hanson (which had bought the London Brick Company in the 1980s) closed the site down as it could not meet UK sulphur emissions rules.

It was probably this industry that saved the Marston Vale railway line between Bedford and Bletchley from the Beeching Axe.  This was the last surviving section of the Oxford to Cambridge "Varsity Line" and is due for an upgrade as part of the East West Rail project.  However, there are currently no trains on the Marston Vale route: it has been replaced by buses since November 2022 following the collapse of Vivarail, the company which owned and maintained the converted London Underground units which previously worked the line.

The Marston Vale brings us to the edge of Bedford at the northern end of the seat.  Here we can find a twenty-first century New Town: Wixams, just to the south of Bedford, is currently a riot of development between the A6 road and the Midland railway line.  It declared independence as a parish within the Bedford council area in 2015, and the notice of poll for this by-election gives it an electorate of 3,140.  The full Wixams development is projected to finish off larger than that, and this may lead to some local government changes in future: the development site straddles the boundary between Bedford borough and Central Bedfordshire district.

This lack of historic towns has meant that Bedfordshire has historically struggled for representation in Parliament.  There were never any rotten boroughs in the county; and the redistribution of 1885, which created the single-member constituency system we still have today, gave Bedfordshire just three MPs.  One of those went to the town of Bedford, while the rest of the county was divided into two constituencies called Biggleswade and Luton.

Slightly more than half of the current Mid Bedfordshire was in the Luton seat during this period.  Partly thanks to Luton being a fast-growing industrial town, Luton was a Liberal seat throughout the period up to the First World War.  Its first MP was by repute the most handsome man in the House of Commons: Cyril Flower, who transferred to Luton after his Brecon constituency disappeared in the 1885 redistribution, had made a fortune through property development in the London districts of Westminster and Battersea.  MPs were not paid a salary until 1922, so back in those days you needed a source of independent wealth to be an MP.

Following the 1885 election, Cyril Flower was appointed to the third Gladstone administration as a Lord Commissioner of the Treasury.  In those days Government posts like that were classed as offices of profit under the Crown, meaning that Flower's seat in the Commons was vacated and he had to fight a by-election on 13th February 1886.  He was re-elected unopposed, which was the norm for "ministerial" by-elections in those days: of the 23 ministerial by-elections in the 1885-86 Parliament, only four were contested.

Cyril Flower was translated to the House of Lords in 1892, taking the title of Lord Battersea after his properties.  The resulting Luton by-election of 29th September 1892 was contested, and turned into quite a close contest between the Liberal Unionist candidate Oliver Duke and the Liberal candidate Samuel Whitbread, from the brewing family of that name.  Whitbread won by 4,838 votes to 4,596, a majority of 242.

Whitbread retired from the Commons in 1895 (although he came back a few years later as MP for Huntingdon in the 1906-10 Parliament), and was replaced by Thomas Ashton.  Ashton came from a millowning family in the textile industry of north-west England; he owned a number of mills in the Cheshire town of Hyde, and was briefly MP for Hyde in the 1885-86 Parliament.  He somehow managed to win five terms as MP for Luton on very small majorities: Ashton won by 186 votes over the Liberal Unionists in 1895, held on in the khaki election of 1900 by just 103 votes over the Conservatives, and his lead was under 1,000 votes in both 1910 elections.

In 1911 Thomas Ashton was promoted to the red benches, becoming the first Lord Ashton of Hyde.  The resulting third Luton by-election on 20th July 1911 returned another candidate with a famous name: the winner was Liberal candidate Cecil Harmsworth, who defeated the Tories' John Hickman by 7,619 votes to 7,006, a majority of 613.  As you will have guessed, Cecil was from the Harmsworth newspaper family: Lord Northcliffe and Lord Rothermere, owners of the <em>Daily Mail</em> and <em>Daily Mirror</em>, were his older brothers.  Cecil had previously sat as MP for Droitwich in the 1906-10 Parliament, so this was a quick return for him.  During his period as MP for this area he briefly served as a junior Home Office minister in 1915 under Asquith.

The 1885 redistribution placed the northern end of what's now Mid Bedfordshire, including Ampthill, within the Biggleswade seat.  This had a much more exciting political history, swinging regularly between the Liberals and the Liberal Unionists (the group which split from the Liberals in 1885-86 over Irish Home Rule and went into alliance with the Conservatives).  The first Biggleswade MP was the Liberals' Charles Magniac, who had previously been one of the two sitting MPs for Bedford but was displaced here by the redistribution.  Magniac was a very rich City financier who served as the first president of the London Chamber of Commerce on its foundation in 1882; he was a partner in Matheson and Company, which is still in business today under the name Jardine Matheson.

Charles Magniac lost his seat in 1886 to the Liberal Unionists' Francis Baring, who had previously been a Liberal MP for Winchester.  Baring was the son and heir of the former Indian viceroy the Earl of Northbrook, and was styled as Viscount Baring at this point in time.

In 1892 Biggleswade swung back to the Liberals and Baring lost his seat.  The new Liberal MP was journalist and London County Councillor George Russell, who had written a biography of the party leader William Gladstone the previous year.  The Grand Old Man returned the favour by appointing Russell straight to the government frontbench, as a junior minister in the India Office; in 1894 Lord Rosebery reshuffled Russell to the Home Office.

The 1895 general election saw the Liberal Unionists regain the seat.  Their candidate was Lord Alwyne Compton, a younger son of the 4th Marquess of Northampton.  Compton had previously been an Army officer and had fought in the Sudan during the 1884 campaign against the Mahdi.

When the Second Boer War broke out, Compton rejoined the Army and was commissioned into the Imperial Yeomanry.  He served in South Africa with sufficient distinction to be awarded the Distinguished Service Order, and returned to the UK in 1901 to find that he had been re-elected unopposed as Liberal Unionist MP for Biggleswade in his absence.

The Liberal landslide of 1906 was a different matter, and Sir Alwyne Compton was soundly defeated by the Liberal candidate Arthur Black.  Black was a lace manufacturer from Nottingham, where he was a councillor and had served as Mayor in 1902-03.  He was re-elected narrowly in both 1910 elections, the only Biggleswade MP to be re-elected.

The 1918 redistribution kept Bedfordshire at three MPs, but disenfranchised the borough of Bedford.  Instead Bedford became the centre of a county seat which took over most of the former Biggleswade constituency, while a new seat was created in the centre of the county.  This was called Mid Bedfordshire, and there has been a Mid Bedfordshire constituency in the House of Commons ever since.  The original seat of that name was larger than that of today, stretching east to Biggleswade and Sandy and west to Leighton Buzzard (but not Linslade, which was still part of Buckinghamshire then).

The Mid Bedfordshire seat started off as a Conservative versus Liberal contest rather like Biggleswade had been, and indeed the Biggleswade Liberal MP Sir Arthur Black sought re-election here in 1918.  However, the coalition government's coupon went to the Conservative candidate Max Townley, who defeated Black comfortably.  Townley was a specialist in agriculture - he was a land agent for the Bedfordshire squire Lord St John of Bletso, and married his daughter - and he concentrated on agricultural matters during his term in parliament.

In 1922 Max Townley lost his seat to the Liberal candidate Frederick Linfield, a corn merchant who had started his political career in local government on the south coast: he served two terms as mayor of Worthing.  In Parliament Linfield concentrated on colonial affairs, and when the 1924 general election was called he was in Uganda on parliamentary business.  This is not a euphemism: it turns out that you can't effectively campaign in a UK general election when you're in east Africa, and Linfield lost his seat to the Conservatives' William Warner by 12,317 votes to 11,356, a majority of 961.

William Warner came to politics from a long military career: he had been an Army officer in India in the 19th and 20th centuries, joined the Army again during the First World War and ended up as one of the first RAF officers, retiring with the rank of brigadier-general.  Before being elected to Parliament in 1924 he had served one term as a London county councillor for Fulham.

The pendulum swung back to the Liberals for the last time in 1929 when Warner was defeated by Liberal candidate Milner Gray, who ran a firm in Luton which made ladies' hats.  Gray sought re-election in 1931, although it's not clear exactly what flavour of Liberal he was: he was a supporter of Ramsay Macdonald's National Government but he wasn't officially part of John Simon's National Liberal group, and in the end the Conservatives stood against him.  Alan Lennox-Boyd defeated Milner Gray by 1,487 votes, and Mid Bedfordshire has had Conservative MPs ever since.

Lennox-Boyd broke the mould of Mid Bedfordshire politics and went on to have a very long career in Parliament, ssrving as an MP for 29 years.  His political career peaked in the 1950s, when he became minister of transport in the second Churchill government before joining the Cabinet in 1954 as Colonial Secretary, a role he held for five years under Churchill, Eden and Macmillan.  On his watch, independence was granted to Cyprus, Ghana, Malaya and Sudan, and the Mau Mau rebellion in Kenya was put down.  Lennox-Boyd saw off a 1955 attempt to apply immigration controls to New Commonwealth citizens by threatening to resign; despite this, he was very much on the right wing of the Conservatives and was associated with the Monday Club in later years.

In 1960 Alan Lennox-Boyd was raised to the peerage and entered the House of Lords as the first Viscount Boyd of Merton.  He was appointed a Companion of Honour later that year.  The resulting first Mid Bedfordshire by-election on 16th November 1960 saw the Conservatives defending a majority of 5,174 over Labour, who had moved into second place in the seat in 1945.  Labour reselected their 1959 candidate Bryan Magee, a philosopher who later had a broadcasting career and served as a Labour and SDP MP for Leyton.  Magee, however, lost the 1960 by-election to the Conservatives' Stephen Hastings, who increased the Conservative majority to over 6,000.

A cousin of the journalist Max Hastings, Stephen Hastings - like his predecessor Alan Lennox-Boyd - had a rather international background and right-wing views.  He had spent some of his early years living on a farm in Rhodesia, served with distinction during the Second World War in North Africa and Italy (winning the Military Cross for commanding a group of Italian partisans who liberated Piacenza), and then worked abroad for MI6 for a time in the 1950s.  Hastings was a major supporter of the Ian Smith régime in Southern Rhodesia, which effectively kept him off the frontbench during his 23 years as a Conservative MP; however, he was a friend of Margaret Thatcher, and entertained the Thatchers during the Falklands War at Milton Hall in Cambridgeshire.  (Milton Hall was owned by his second wife Lady Elizabeth Hastings, who had inherited it from her father Earl Fitzwilliam.)  Outside Parliament Sir Stephen Hastings was a master of the Fitzwilliam Hunt, and he raised millions of pounds for the 2001-06 restoration of Peterborough Cathedral.

Sir Stephen Hastings won seven terms of office as MP for Mid Bedfordshire, only being seriously challenged in 1966 when Labour cut his majority to almost 3,000.  He passed on a rather different Mid Bedfordshire seat to his Conservative successor in 1983.  The redistribution of that year saw major changes to the seats in southern Bedfordshire, changes which were essentially reversed in 1997: the two compact and urban Luton seats were expanded into the countryside, with Luton North now reaching as far north as Flitwick.  The Woburn area also transferred to the redrawn seat of South West Bedfordshire.  In compensation, Mid Bedfordshire expanded north to take in the Bedford suburb/satellite town of Kempston.

North Luton was also a Conservative seat in the period 1983-97, while it included Flitwick.  Its MP during this period was yet another Monday Club rightwinter, John Carlisle, who had won the predecessor seat of Luton West in 1979.

The new Mid Bedfordshire still proved to be safely Conservative and a safe berth for the new MP Nicholas Lyell, who had been MP for Hemel Hempstead in the 1979 parliament before moving here.  Sir Nicholas was a successful barrister who during his time as Mid Bedfordshire's MP went on to become one of the UK's longest-serving law officers: he was Solicitor-General throughout the 1987-92 Parliament, before being promoted to Attorney-General for the 1992-97 Parliament.  Lyell's time on the frontbench was marked by severe criticism of his role in the Matrix Churchill "arms to Iraq" affair, while he also had major financial losses in 1989-92 as a Lloyd's name.

The 1997 boundary changes awarded a sixth seat to Bedfordshire, which was created in the north of the county.  Bedford town became an urban constituency of its own for the first time since 1918, and a new North East Bedfordshire seat was created which took in Biggleswade and Sandy.  Mid Bedfordshire lost those areas but got Flitwick and Woburn back.  That basically created the seat we have today, as the 2010 redistribution changed the Bedfordshire seats only marginally.

Sir Nicholas Lyell decided to seek re-election in 1997 in North East Bedfordshire, and the Mid Bedfordshire Conservative nomination went to Jonathan Sayeed.  He was a businessman and Royal Navy veteran who became one of the 20th century's first ethnic minority MPs when he gained Bristol East from Tony Benn in 1983.  Sayeed's progress up the greasy pole was interrupted when he lost his seat in 1992, but Mid Bedfordshire proved to be a much safer berth.  From 2001 to 2003 he was on the Conservative frontbench as a junior DEFRA shadow minister, before resigning to vote against the Iraq war.

In 2004 the <em>Sunday Times</em> reported that Jonathan Sayeed was a shareholder in a company which organised luxury holidays in the UK and charged its clients up to £500 per day for access to the Palace of Westminster, that access being through Sayeed.  Although Sayeed and the company involved both denied the allegations, the Commons Standards and Privileges Committee were not impressed: in February 2005 they recommended that Sayeed be suspended for ten sitting days, a sanction which these days would lead to a recall petition.  Jonathan Sayeed lost the Conservative whip, and he was not a candidate in the 2005 general election shortly afterwards - ostensibly he retired on health grounds.

The Mid Bedfordshire Conservatives then selected Nadine Dorries, a native Liverpudlian who had previously worked as a nurse, as head of a school in Zambia, and in the childcare sector.  Dorries had previously stood for Parliament in Hazel Grove in 2001 and she had been an unsuccessful candidate for Macclesfield council in 2002; Mid Bedfordshire in 2005 was her first election win.

Nadine Dorries' Parliamentary career has certainly been a colourful one, which included a brush with the Election Court; an independent candidate who polled 0.7% against her in 2015 alleged that Dorries had made false statements about his character, but the Court threw his claim out on a technicality.  In 2012 Dorries lost the Conservative whip for a time after appearing on the ITV programme <em>I'm A Celebrity</em>, which involved being in Australia while Parliament was sitting; a belated entry in the Commons register of interests revealed that Dorries was paid a total £20,228 for being the first celebrity to be evicted by the public that year.  In 2020 she was the first MP to be diagnosed with COVID-19.

Dorries' time on the frontbench came under the Boris Johnson premiership, initially as a junior health minister before she joined the Cabinet in 2021 as culture secretary.  She served in that role for a year, having fun stoking the culture wars, before returning to the backbenches to write novels when Johnson left office in September 2022.  In June 2023 Dorries announced her resignation from the Commons with "immediate effect", in what looked for all the world like a strop at her not being given a peerage in Johnson's resignation honours list; but it took her until the end of August to overcome writer's block and actually compose a resignation letter.  Which is why this by-election is being held only now.
