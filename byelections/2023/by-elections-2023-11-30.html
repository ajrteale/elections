Four polls on 30th November 2023, and it's a bit of a Green special this week...
</p><p>
<h2>Highgate</h2>
</p><p>
Camden council, London; caused by the resignation of Green Party councillor Siân Berry.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/camden-highgate-2023.png" alt="Camden, Highgate" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
We'll start the week in one of the most iconic - and most expensive - parts of London.  Highgate lies around 4½ miles north of Charing Cross in scenery you don't often get in inner London - green open space.  The western half of Highgate ward is covered by Hampstead Heath, with the 93-metre summit of Parliament Hill lying within the ward boundary.  In the middle we have the ward's housing along Highgate West Hill; on the southern boundary we find the London Overground station at Gospel Oak and the rather more densely-populated area of Dartmouth Park.
</p><p>
In the eastern part of this ward we find the municipal gardens of Waterlow Park, and the rather more creepy green space of Highgate Cemetery.  This is one of the largest and most famous necropolises in England, with its interments including an intriguing list of the great and the good of London and further afield: I could name figures such as Karl Marx, Michael Faraday, Douglas Adams and Jeremy Beadle, but that would barely scratch the surface of the list of notable people lying in eternal rest at Highgate Cemetery.  The total number of interments here since the cemetery opened for business in 1839 is estimated at around 170,000.
</p><p>
Hopefully Camden council have a plan in place for when the zombie apocalypse arrives, because Highgate is definitely a place where the dead outnumber the living.  The 2021 census found 10,226 residents of Camden's Highgate ward, who are disproportionately well-educated.  Highgate ranked 3rd of all the wards in England and Wales for people who work in the arts, entertainment and recreation sector, at 8.6%; this was the highest figure for any ward in London, and is beaten only by Etruria and Hanley in Stoke-on-Trent (pottery) and by Lambourn in Berkshire (presumably the census classified the horseracing industry as "arts, entertainment and recreation").  Highgate also came in the top 100 in England and Wales for those working in professional, scientific and technical activities (18.2%) and for Judaism (5.2%).
</p><p>
The Highgate area is split between the London Boroughs of Camden and Haringey, both of which have neighbouring wards called "Highgate".  To be clear, this by-election is for the Camden Highgate ward.  This is currently part of the Holborn and St Pancras constituency represented by the Leader of the Opposition, Sir Keir Starmer.  However, his seat is oversized and Highgate will be moved out of it at the next general election: the Boundary Commissioners have recreated the Hampstead and Highgate seat which was broken up in 2010, and which previously returned the late Glenda Jackson to Parliament.  So it's likely that from some point next year Highgate's MP will be Labour's Tulip Siddiq, who has represented Hampstead and Kilburn since 2015.  Siddiq is a niece of Sheikh Hasina, the prime minister of Bangladesh, and in British politics she is on Starmer's frontbench as a shadow Treasury minister.
</p><p>
Tulip Siddiq cut her political teeth on Camden council, which has been under Labour control since 1971 with the exception of a hung council in the 2006-10 term.  One of the wards which Labour lost in the 2006 election was Highgate, which split its two seats between two Green councillors and a Conservative.  The Conservative councillor resigned two years later and the Greens won the resulting by-election, making Highgate the first ward in London to elect a full slate of Green Party councillors.  This didn't last.  In 2010 Labour gained two of the Green seats, and ever since then Highgate's political representation has been stable with one Green and two Labour councillors.
</p><p>
Siân Berry took over as Highgate ward's Green councillor in 2014, and she topped the poll here in both 2018 and 2022.  Berry, who had previously fought this ward in 2002 and came close to election then, has long been one of the most high-profile figures in the Green Party of England and Wales.  She was the party's Principal Speaker in 2006-07 and then leader or co-leader of the party in 2018-21, and stood as the Green candidate in the 2008 and 2016 London Mayor elections.  In addition to her Camden council rôle, Berry has held elected office since 2016 as a Green member of the London Assembly - the only English political body elected by proportional representation.
</p><p>
In recent years the Green Party have been doing very well in local elections.  Every year this column notes the election of more and more Green councillors in more and more councils.  At ward level, the Greens have clearly cracked how to target their resources at particular wards in order to gain representation.
</p><p>
Parliamentary level is another matter, and there has only ever been one Green Member of Parliament.  That's Caroline Lucas, who has held the Brighton Pavilion constituency since 2010; she previously sat in the European Parliament from 1999 to 2010, and before that she was an Oxfordshire county councillor in 1993-97.  Lucas is standing down at the next general election, and the Brighton Pavilion Greens have not decided to promote one of their local councillors to replace her (the various Green administrations in Brighton and Hove have had decidedly mixed reviews from the electorate); instead the Green candidate for Brighton Pavilion next time will be Siân Berry.  Berry has resigned from Camden council to focus on seeking election in Brighton.
</p><p>
Which gives the Greens a tricky by-election defence in Highgate ward.  The 2022 elections here gave 44% to the Greens and 42% to Labour, with most of the Green score clearly being a personal vote for Siân Berry.  The Greens will be hoping that can transfer to Lorna Russell, who was their second candidate here last year and also contested a by-election in June 2023 in South Hampstead ward, coming in fourth and last place; Russell was elected to Camden council in 2014 and 2018 as a Labour councillor for Fortune Green ward, before defecting to the Greens in 2021.  The official Labour candidate Tricia Leman is a retired teacher who lives and volunteers within the ward.  Also standing are Wakjira Feyesa for the Conservatives and Farrell Monk for the Liberal Democrats.

<h2>Portsoken</h2>
</p><p>
City of London Court of Aldermen; caused by the resignation of Alderman Prem Goyal, who is seeking re-election.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/city-portsoken-2023.png" alt="City of London, Portsoken" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
We stay in London for our second poll this week, which is an Aldermanic election.  That fact alone tells us that we are in the City of London, for the City Corporation is the UK's only remaining elected body which still has Aldermen.  There are 25 Aldermen, being the senior councillors from whom the Lord Mayor and other major City officials are chosen: that's one Alderman for each of the City's 25 wards.
</p><p>
The City Corporation has managed to escape every round of local government reorganisation over the last two centuries and still has the sort of powers and responsibilities of an old 19th-century borough.  It runs its own police force, for instance.  But the City has the population of a largish parish council and the non-partisan politics to match, with the wrinkle that the right to vote here is not solely rested in residents.  Twenty-one of the City's 25 wards are now dominated by office and commercial buildings with very few residents living within their boundaries, and in those wards the voter roll is dominated by sole traders and electors nominated by businesses who are based within those wards.
</p><p>
In the other four wards local residents form a majority of the electorate.  These are Aldersgate and Cripplegate wards which cover the Barbican and Golden Lane estates; Queenhithe ward where a large number of Thames-side apartments can be found; and Portsoken ward on the eastern edge of the City.  This tiny area consists of two residential blocks either side of Aldgate underground station along the western side of Mansell Street and Middlesex Street (the home of the Petticoat Lane market).
</p><p>
The Portsoken ward boundaries also have a salient further into the City which consists of two further buildings: the wonderfully-named church of St Botolph without Aldgate and Holy Trinity Minories (yes, that's one church), and the Sir John Cass's Foundation primary school.  Well, that was what I wrote the last time this column looked at Portsoken in December 2017: but Sir John Cass, as effectively a director of the Royal African Company during the early 18th century, was a key figure in the transatlantic slave trade, and following the George Floyd protests of 2020 his name is now too hot for the school or the foundation to handle.  The Aldgate School, as the primary school was renamed in September 2020, is the only state-funded school within the boundaries of the City.
</p><p>
Some of this ward was in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets until boundary changes in the early 1990s, and the resident population shares many of the features of the neighbouring Whitechapel and Spitalfields/Banglatown wards.  This is a deprived area.  For that reason Labour have been taking Portsoken ward seriously in recent years.  Labour's William Campbell-Taylor won a by-election here in May 2014, and then Labour topped the poll in the March 2017 City elections, winning two out of four seats.  In December 2017 the position of Alderman for Portsoken ward came up for election: Campbell-Taylor, who had retired from the Court of Common Council in March 2017, contested that election as an official Labour candidate, and he is the only official Labour candidate to seek election as an Alderman of the City of London in recent years.  (There are Aldermen who are Labour members, but they were elected as non-party candidates.)
</p><p>
However, the win went to Prem Goyal who polled 58% of the vote to Campbell-Taylor's 36%.  Originally from New Delhi, Goyal runs Global Markets Consultants, a management consultancy firm which provides services to the financial industry.  He is also an advisor to the Hinduja Group, chairs the City of London Chamber, and was appointed OBE in 2012 for services to the economy and for promoting charitable giving.  Before becoming an Alderman Goyal had sought the Labour selection in Bermondsey and Old Southwark for the 2015 general election, didn't get it, and then founded his own political party, the All People's Party; this turned into a ramshackle group of disaffected Southwark Labour figures and made no impact at all.  Goyal himself stood in Camberwell and Peckham in the 2015 general election, coming sixth out of eleven candidates with 1.6%.
</p><p>
The Labour tide now appears to be going out in Portsoken ward.  The two Labour Common Councilmen for the ward were both re-elected as non-party candidates in the March 2022 City elections, and Portsoken now has four independent Common Councilmen again.
</p><p>
Aldermen of the City are technically elected for life, but they are expected to seek re-election every six years; accordingly Prem Goyal is now seeking a second term of office from his electors.  Aldermen seeking re-election aren't always challenged, but there will be a contest here between Goyal and Nazifa Chowdhury, who is a trainee barrister at the Inner Temple.  As normal for the City, both of them are non-party candidates.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/city-farringdon-wt-2023.png" alt="City of London, Farringdon Wt" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
The Inner Temple is at the other end of the City in <b>Farringdon Without</b> ward, where there was also due to be an election today.  This is the City's largest ward, electing ten of the 100 Common Councilmen.  Since 2017 those ten seats have been held by a localist party, Temple and Farringdon Together; in March 2022 the ten-person TFT slate beat a single Labour candidate by 73-27.  Common Councilwoman Caroline Addy, another barrister, resigned her seat in August; when nominations closed in the resulting by-election the Temple and Farringdon Together candidate Suzanne Ornsby, who is a Pevensey parish councillor and a barrister who specialises in planning law, was the only candidate for the vacancy.  Accordingly Ornsby was formally declared elected unopposed at yesterday's wardmote or public meeting for Farringdon Without ward, and this column sends its congratulations to her.

<h2>Soweby and Topcliffe</h2>
</p><p>
North Yorkshire council; caused by the resignation of Green Party councillor Dave Whitfield.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/n-yorks-sowerby-topcliffe.png" alt="N Yorks, Sowerby/Topcliffe" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Our other Green defence of the week comes in North Yorkshire.  We travel to the Vale of Mowbray, a low-lying area between the Dales to the west and the North York Moors to the east.  Here we find a relatively flat and agricultural landscape crossed by meandering rivers and straighter transport links: the River Swale is the south-western boundary of this ward, the East Coast Main Line passes through from southeast to northwest straight as an arrow, and the A168 dual carriageway - the main road linking Teesside with the south - passes through from southwest to northeast.
</p><p>
In this context the name of the village of Topcliffe is a little misleading: the cliff referred to in the name is little more than a steep bank going down to the River Swale.  Topcliffe has been a crossing-point of the Swale for centuries, and that crossing-point was once guarded by a castle which was home to the Percy family until they moved to Alnwick in the fourteenth century.  Only the castle mound remains today.
</p><p>
Topcliffe gets some passing trade from road traffic on the A168, and your columnist has fond childhood memories of regular stops at the Happy Eater there.  I notice that's now been demolished and a Starbucks has grown up in its place.  Such is progress.  However, the major employer here is the military.  The airfield of RAF Topcliffe was established in 1940 as a wartime Bomber Command station; the Royal Air Force still have a squadron here which trains glider pilots, but in 1974 most of the airfield site was taken over by the Army which filled it with barrack blocks.  Alanbrooke Barracks is currently home to the 4th Regiment Royal Artillery.  Which gives me an excuse to bring you the Royal Artillery's regimental march, Kenneth Alford's <em>The Voice of the Guns</em>.
</p><p>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtJ2ho7aEls
</p><p>
But don't let this rural landscape confuse you.  Over 70% of this ward's electorate - 4,310 voters - live in Sowerby, which is to all intents and purposes a southern extension of the town of Thirsk but remains a separate parish.  Sowerby has seen major population growth in recent years.
</p><p>
From 1953 Sowerby was home to Alf Wight, who worked as a vet in Thirsk at the time and turned his experiences of dealing with his clients and other animals into some thinly-disguised fiction under the pen-name of James Herriot.  The <em>All Creatures Great and Small</em> franchise has been a huge popular and commercial success over the last half-century, and Wight made enough money out of his books and their film and TV adaptations that he was able to move out of Sowerby in 1977, buying a house in a nearby village.
</p><p>
One house in Sowerby with a blue plaque on its walls is called Lansbury House, which might give an indication as to the politics of its most famous resident.  That was the seriously left-wing Labour MP Joan Maynard, who cut her teeth in politics in this area: Maynard founded and was the first secretary of the Thirsk branch of the Labour party, and she was elected to the North Riding County Council and served as a Justice of the Peace for Thirsk before entering Parliament in October 1974 as MP for Sheffield Brightside.  Joan Maynard died in Sowerby in 1998, eleven years after leaving the Commons.
</p><p>
However, in normal circumstances the politics of Sowerby is exemplified by a terrace at the north end of the village which is variously known as the Blue Terrace or the Bribery Terrace: it was erected by the aristocratic Lascelles family, and its residents were expected to vote Conservative if they wanted to continue living there.  The local parliamentary seat of Thirsk and Malton is one of the safest Conservative seats in the land, and has been a nice birth since 2015 for Kevin Hollinrake.  Hollinrake was a successful businessman before entering politics, and he is currently a junior minister in the Department for Business and Trade.
</p><p>
At local level the Tories are so dominant here it can be difficult to find opposition candidates who are prepared to stand.  The last time there was a local by-election in this area, for the former Topcliffe ward of Hambleton council in December 2013, the Conservative candidate was elected unopposed.  The present ward was created in 2015 and originally returned two members of Hambleton council - both Conservatives, both returned with large majorities in both 2015 and 2019.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2022/n-yorks22.png" alt="N Yorks, 2022" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
So it must have been a nasty shock for the local Tories when local government reorganisation turned this ward into a single-member ward of North Yorkshire council.  This went to the polls in May 2022, by which point the shine had seriously come off the Johnson government.  As in 2019, there was a straight fight: the only candidate to stand against the Conservatives was Dave Whitfield of the Green Party, who went on to win Sowerby and Topcliffe by the narrow margin of 1,091 votes to 1,010.  In percentage terms, that's 52-48.
</p><p>
The 2022 North Yorkshire county elections returned a small Conservative majority of 47 out of 90 seats, which has since disappeared thanks to defection and by-election losses; the Tory administration currently holds half of the 90 seats.  A Tory gain in this by-election will restore their council majority.  It's fair to say that this corner of North Yorkshire is not a Green heartland, and this will be a difficult defence for the party following Whitfield's resignation last month on health grounds.
</p><p>
This by-election will have a lot more choice for the voters than previous polls here.  Defending for the Green Party is John Law, who gives an address in the village of Husthwaite outside this ward.  The Conservatives' Dave Elders appeared in this column five years ago, winning an October 2018 by-election to Hambleton council in the neighbouring Thirsk ward (<em>Andrew's Previews 2018</em>, page 344); he lost his place in local government when Hambleton council disappeared in April this year, but now has an opportunity to return.  Also standing are four candidates from parties which didn't contest Sowerby and Topcliffe in 2022: Stew Exotic for the Official Monster Raving Loony Party, John Hall for the Yorkshire Party, Dan Sladden for the Liberal Democrats and Helen Tomlinson for Labour.

<h2>Dawdon</h2>
</p><p>
Durham council; caused by the death of Labour councillor Leanne Kennedy.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/durham-dawdon-2023.png" alt="Durham, Dawdon" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
<blockquote>
Upon this dreary coast we have nothing but county meetings and shipwrecks; and I have this day dined upon fish, which probably dined upon the crews of several colliers lost in the late gales. But I saw the sea once more in all the glories of surf and foam.
</blockquote>
</p><p>
That was Lord Byron writing in 1815 on the Durham coast during a short-lived and acrimonious marriage to Anne Isabella Milbanke, later Baroness Wentworth.  She was daughter of the local landowner, a social reformer, and the mother of their daughter Ada Lovelace.  Clearly the local coast has caught imaginations through the generations: a local beach used for coal dumping was used as a location for the film <em>Alien 3</em>, while the Sunderland Echo reported in 1999 that scenes from <em>Saving Private Ryan</em> had also been planned to be filmed on the local coastline.
</p><p>
The Milbanke family never recovered financially from their daughter's marriage to Byron, and shortly afterwards they sold the area to the Marquess of Londonderry.  He had big plans.  He built a harbour - called Seaham Harbour after the local village - and sunk a series of major and successful coal mines, founding a new community called Dawdon to serve Dawdon Colliery.  From essentially nothing in 1821 Dawdon grew to a population of over 9,000 in the 1891 census, and a church - dedicated to St Hild and St Helen - was opened in 1912 thanks to donations from local pitmen.  Dawdon Colliery closed in 1991 creating major unemployment and some depopulation in the area, and it was in that depressed state that scenes from the film <em>Billy Elliot</em>, set on the Durham coast, were filmed in the town.
</p><p>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWrGoGdmAfM
</p><p>
The electoral history of this area is a little difficult to follow because the division includes the town centre of Seaham, which over the years has migrated towards the harbour.  Clearly the locals aren't too fussed about Lord Byron's comments above, given that Seaham's small covered shopping centre next the harbour is called Byron Place.  The town retains a rail link, with Seaham railway station lying on the Durham Coast line; there are hourly trains south to Hartlepool and Teesside, and north to Sunderland and Newcastle.
</p><p>
This being the Durham coalfield, Labour are normally in the ascendancy.  The local parliamentary seat, which was called Seaham from 1918 to 1950 and has borne the name Easington since then, has voted Labour at every election since 1922 with the exception of 1931, when the winner here was the Prime Minister - one James Ramsay MacDonald, successfully seeking re-election as National Labour.  This Labour leader/traitor (delete to taste) was preceded as the Seaham MP by the LSE and <em>New Statesman</em> founder Sidney Webb, and was defeated in 1935 by long-serving Labour frontbencher Manny Shinwell.  Since 2010 Easington has been a safe berth in Parliament for Grahame Morris, who has generally remained on the Labour backbenches but was briefly in Jeremy Corbyn's shadow cabinet in 2016.
</p><p>
The Easington constituency is named after a former County Durham district council which was abolished in 2009, leaving Durham council as the local authority.  Durham returned a hung council at the most recent elections in May 2021 as Labour lost their majority, and a coalition of Conservative, Liberal Democrat, independent, localist and North East Party councillors was put together to end almost a century of Labour rule in the county.  Although the Conservatives are the second-largest group on Durham council, the council leader is a Lib Dem.
</p><p>
The first election to the modern Durham council was held in 2008 and saw Dawdon division's two seats split: one for Labour, and one to independent candidate Bob Arthur who topped the poll.  Arthur lost his seat to Labour in 2013, and has finished as runner-up in every election here since.
</p><p>
In May 2017 Labour councillor Sonia Forster stood down and was replaced by Leanne Kennedy, who won the ward's second seat by 102 votes over Arthur.  Unfortunately, Kennedy was ineligible for election at the time, because she was employed by Durham council on the school run.  She resigned as a councillor immediately, resigned her employment, and then stood for re-election in the resulting council by-election on 29th June 2017 (<em>Andrew's Previews 2017</em>. page 175).  In a straight fight with the Seaham Community Party candidate Bob Arthur, Kennedy was re-elected by 693 votes to 633.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/durham21.png" alt="Durham, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
After that false start Leanne Kennedy was able to settle down into her council career, and by all accounts she served Dawdon with distinction.  In May 2021 she was re-elected with an increased majority as the Labour slate defeated the Seaham Community Party by 51-33.  Shortly thereafter Kennedy became Mayor of Seaham, serving in that role for the customary year.
</p><p>
Leanne Kennedy passed away in September at the horribly early age of 44.  Her name will live on in the town, as earlier this month the trustees of the Dawdon Community Centre unanimously voted to rename the centre after Kennedy.  Unfortunately this news came too late for Durham electoral services, which had already sent out 1,073 polling cards instructing the electors in polling district EOD to vote at the Dawdon Community Centre.  Never mind, there will be time to update the records before the next Durham county elections in 2025.
</p><p>
Defending the Dawdon by-election for Labour is Seaham town councillor June Watson, who is unhappy with a council plan to impose parking charges on Seaham's car parks.  Another Seaham town councillor on the ballot is Bob Arthur, who is making his latest attempt to get back the seat he lost in 2013; this time Arthur is an independent candidate.  The Conservatives' Josh Rayner and the Lib Dems' Roger Vila complete the candidate list.
