"All the right votes, but not necessarily in the right order"
</blockquote>
</p><p>
It's the weekend after the local elections, which means that it's time to write my traditional debrief piece trying to summarise the results and seeing how my previews from before the election (which you can read <a href="https://medium.com/britainelects/previewing-the-english-local-elections-of-4th-may-2023-d90f5831f1e7">here (link)</a>) stacked up.  These debrief pieces haven't always gone out in the past, but you can find previous entries in this series in the Andrew's Previews books should you really want to.
</p><p>
Of the 230 councils up for election in England on 4th May, 77 have changed hands so there's rather a lot to get through.  The Conservatives lost more than half of the councils they were defending overall majorities on, mostly to the benefit of Labour.  The BBC's count gives 71 councils with Labour majorities, 33 Conservatives, 29 Lib Dems, 4 independent or Resident majorities, 1 Green (the first time there has ever been a council with a Green overall majority) and 92 hung councils.  The latter figure includes Redcar and Cleveland, where a recount in one very close ward has had to be held over until Tuesday.
</p><p>
The BBC's projected national share of the vote gave 35% to Labour, 26% to the Conservatives and 20% to the Lib Dems.  Compared with 2019, that is a 7-point gain for Labour, a two-point loss for the Conservatives and a one-point gain for the Lib Dems; compared with 2022 and thus with this column's par-score, the Conservatives are down four points, the Lib Dems up one and Labour are static.  These changes delivered outsize Conservative losses for a number of reasons.  26% is too low a share of the vote to be sure of winning a lot of seats even in England's first-past-the-post system; there is some evidence of anti-Conservative tactical voting; and there is clearly some political realignment going on compared with the long-ago days of May or December 2019.  As you will now see when this piece starts to look at the changes in more detail.  I haven't had time to prepare maps of my own yet, but the <a href="https://sotn.newstatesman.com/2023/05/britain-elects-results">Britain Elects State of the Nation interactive map is taking shape (link)</a> and I would recommend you refer to that.
</p><p>
<h2>North East</h2>
</p><p>
This year's North East elections were concentrated in the metropolitan county of Tyne and Wear, and in the Tees Valley.  The former still has Labour in control of all five councils, with Labour gaining five seats in Sunderland to increase their majority.  The Tees Valley was a bit more mixed.
</p><p>
The standout result here almost came in Hartlepool, where I suggested that a Labour majority "would probably have to wait for 2024, when most of the Conservative group will need to seek re-election".  Well, a better-than-expected result for Labour saw them gain six seats and only just miss out on a seventh gain in Hart ward.  That leaves Labour with half of the council, 18 councillors against 12 Conservatives and six independents or localists; the independent/Conservative coalition which has run the town since 2019 has surely been defeated.
</p><p>
Instead the main story for Labour here is their gain of Middlesbrough, where independent mayor Andy Preston was narrowly defeated by Labour's Chris Cooke: Cooke polled 40% against 37% for Preston, with the independent candidate Jon Rathmell narrowly defeating the Conservatives for third on 11%.  Labour also now have a majority on Middlesbrough council, which stands at 25 Labour, 15 independents, 4 Conservatives and two Lib Dems.  Labour may also seek to take control in Redcar and Cleveland, where they are now clearly the largest party: the count there currently stands at 22 Labour councillors, 12 Conservatives, 12 independents and 11 Lib Dems, with the two seats in Longbeck ward (which returned two Conservatives in 2019 and voted strongly Conservative at a 2021 by-election) still outstanding.  Labour now have half of the seats in Darlington and should take over from a Conservative-independent coalition.  The bright spot for the Teesside Conservatives came in Stockton-on-Tees, where they gained a large number of independent seats and are now the largest party: Stockton council stands at 23 Conservatives, 22 Labour and 8 independents and localists, with the three seats in Hartburn ward due to poll at a later date.
</p><p>
The Durham council by-election in Chester-le-Street East saw a convincing gain for Labour from the Conservatives.
</p><p>
<h2>North West</h2>
</p><p>
Turning to the North West, in Greater Manchester there continues to be eight councils with a Labour majority and two hung councils.  One of the latter is the Greatest Town in the Known Universe.  Bolton has been run by a Conservative minority administration since 2019; this would appear to have been defeated, with Labour now the largest party on 26 seats against 17 Conservatives, 11 localists and 6 Lib Dems.  Labour performed well against the Conservatives, and even won a seat in Astley Bridge ward for the first time in many years; what cost them the chance of a majority was a clean sweep for the localists in Horwich and Blackrod.  I would expect Labour to take control of the council here with some form of Lib Dem support.
</p><p>
I had pegged the Home of the Tubular Bandage as an area of possible Labour weakness.  Labour are still in control, but only just with 32 out of 60 seats; for the third year in a row the Leader of the Council has lost their seat.
</p><p>
The Conservatives have been wiped out in Stockport council, losing all their seats to the Lib Dems in a borough which has two Conservative MPs.  On its own, that would have been enough for a Lib Dem majority on the council; but the Lib Dems also lost ground on their left flank to Labour, which compensated Labour for losing Edgeley ward to a localist group.  The new Stockport council has 30 Lib Dems, 24 Labour, 6 independents or localists and 3 Greens.
</p><p>
Over the border in Cheshire, Labour gained overall control of Cheshire West and Chester council and look well placed to continue running the hung Cheshire East in coalition with independents and residents; Labour gained six seats in Cheshire East, and are now only two behind the Conservatives who remain the largest party on that council.  Congratulations are due to this column's genial host, Cheshire West and Chester Councillor (as he now is) Ben Walker.
</p><p>
The Land of the Plastic Scouser remains hung, although Labour did reverse losses made in recent years and remain clearly the largest party on the peninsula.  Wirral council now has 30 Labour councillors, 17 Conservatives (who were the main losers this year), 13 Greens and 6 Lib Dems.  Labour remain comfortably in control of Liverpool over the water.
</p><p>
In the Lancashire county council area, Labour have gained overall majorities in West Lancashire (26 out of 45 so far, with the three seats in Rural South ward yet to poll) and in South Ribble (29 out of 50 seats, with seven gains from the Conservatives).  Hyndburn, where the party has suffered a serious split in recent years, remains hung.  I had set a par score of "an 18â€“18 tie between the Conservatives and Labour, with the two Greens and an ex-Labour independent holding the balance of power"; clearly I miscounted because the Conservatives and Labour are indeed tied, but only on 16 seats each.  The AGM here will be interesting.
</p><p>
Elsewhere in East Lancashire, Labour increased their majority in Rossendale and made gains in Burnley, which now stands at 21 Labour councillors, 7 seats each for the Conservatives, Greens and Lib Dems and 3 independents.  I had flagged a likely Conservative loss in Pendle which has indeed come to pass; the Tories lost three seats in Pendle which now stands at 14 Conservatives, 11 Labour, 7 Lib Dems and an independent.  I had not foreseen the Conservatives losing control of the rural Ribble Valley district, which now stands at 18 Conservative councillors, 8 Lib Dems, 7 Labour, 5 independents and 2 Greens.  That's a very impressive performance from Labour: in the five previous Ribble Valley elections this century Labour had never won more than one seat and sometimes not even that.
</p><p>
That leaves the Conservatives only in control of Fylde and Wyre districts within the Lancashire county council area.  Labour successfully recovered their majority in Blackpool and are the largest party in the politically-volatile Lancaster district, which split 24 Labour, 21 Green, 7 Lib Dems, 5 Conservatives and 4 independents.
</p><p>
The Westmorland and Furness council by-election was an easy Labour hold in Old Barrow and Hindpool ward.
</p><p>
<h2>Yorkshire</h2>
</p><p>
In the Yorkshire metropolitan boroughs it's as you were.  All the councils up for election retained Labour majorities except for Sheffield, where Labour underperformed: they failed to gain two wards from the Lib Dems which had gone Labour last year, and Sheffield council remains unchanged at 38 Labour, 29 Lib Dems, 14 Greens, 1 Conservative and 1 independent.  The Wakefield Conservatives, who are clearly still in disarray after losing the Wakefield parliamentary by-election last year, lost every seat they were defending.
</p><p>
Over in the east of the county, the Lib Dems increased their majority in Kingston upon Hull.  I had highlighted the rural East Riding district as one to watch, and that was justified: the Conservatives lost 20 seats here and their council majority.  East Riding council now stands at 29 Conservatives, 22 Lib Dems, 9 independents, 4 Labour and 3 seats for the Yorkshire Party.  York council now has a Labour majority, with Labour wiping out the Green councillors in the central wards and gaining the safe ward of Fulford and Heslington from the Lib Dems to do that: it's only a majority of one seat, with 24 Labour against 19 Lib Dems, 3 Conservatives and an independent.  Labour may now seek to reverse a move by the previous Lib Dem-Green administration to ban blue-badge parking in the city centre.
</p><p>
<h2>East Midlands</h2>
</p><p>
Moving into the East Midlands, Labour can look at their performance in Derbyshire with a lot of satisfaction.  They have gained overall majorities in High Peak, North East Derbyshire, Bolsover, Erewash, South Derbyshire and most spectacularly Amber Valley, where an unusually strong Reform UK slate clearly split the Conservative vote.  The Conservatives lost six seats and their majority in Derbyshire Dales, where the Liberal Democrats are now the largest party.  The minority Conservative administration in Derby might also have reached the end of the road: Derby council now stands at 23 Labour councillors, 15 Conservatives, 6 seats for Reform Derby (the local affiliate of Reform UK, and the only seats which Reform UK won at these elections), 4 Lib Dems and 3 independents.
</p><p>
In Nottinghamshire, Labour increased their majority in Bassetlaw.  They had no trouble retaining the Mansfield mayoralty, where Andy Abrahams was re-elected with 45% against 26% for the Conservatives and 23% for the Mansfield Independents; Labour now also have overall control of Mansfield council to match that.  Broxtowe was previously run by a Labour-led coalition, but Labour can now rule alone with 26 seats against 10 Conservatives, 5 Lib Dems and 3 independents.  The Zadroznyites actually increased their majority in Ashfield, although the ward results aren't quite as laughably one-sided as last time, and they easily defended the Kirkby South by-election to Nottinghamshire county council.  The big surprise here is that the Conservatives lost control of Newark and Sherwood, where independent candidates were the main gainers: Newark and Sherwood now stands at 14 Conservative councillors, 11 independents, 11 Labour and 3 Lib Dems.
</p><p>
On the south bank of the Humber, Labour did do slightly better than the par score in North East Lincolnshire, gaining Croft Baker ward in Cleethorpes from the Conservatives who still have a large majority here.  In the Lincolnshire county council area there were good Conservative performances in North Kesteven, which had returned an independent majority four years ago but where the Tories peeled off enough independent councillors to keep control, and in North Lincolnshire which is unchanged from 2019.  However, Boston now has an independent majority; the Liberal Democrats hold half of the seats in West Lindsey; and East Lindsey and South Kesteven have fallen into No Overall Control.  The Lincolnshire county council by-election in Eagle and Hykeham West was a Conservative hold.  The Liberal Democrats are now the largest party in England's "smallest" "county", with 11 seats in Rutland against 7 independents, just 6 Conservatives, 2 Labour and a Green.
</p><p>
In Leicestershire, there is now only one council with a Conservative majority: ironically that's Blaby, which I had described in the Preview as "the most marginal Leicestershire district at present".  What do I know?  Labour are now the largest party in North West Leicestershire and are just three seats behind in Charnwood where the Conservatives lost 16 seats; there were also big gains in Charnwood for the Green Party.  There are now Labour councillors in Melton for the first time since 2015; in fact Labour won five seats here, with the Conservatives losing eleven overall to stand just one ahead of the independent councillors.  The Lib Dems may well seek to take over the administration in Harborough, which stands at 15 Conservatives, 13 Lib Dems, and 3 each for Labour and the Greens.
</p><p>
The 16 Conservative seat losses in Charnwood were balanced by a gain of 17 Conservative seats in Leicester, where the council still has a Labour majority but is now far more politically diverse than it has been for the last few terms: there are now 31 Labour councillors, 17 Conservatives, and 3 each for the Lib Dems and Greens.  Sir Peter Soulsby was re-elected as the Labour mayor of Leicester, but his Conservative opponent Sanjay Modhwadia put up a strong challenge: Soulsby's vote fell from 61% to 39%, against 30% for Modhwadia and 11% for the former Lib Dem MP Parmjit Singh Gill.  If Modhwadia fancies going for the Conservative nomination in Leicester East at next year's general election, on this evidence he might do very well indeed.
</p><p>
<h2>West Midlands</h2>
</p><p>
In recent electoral cycles Staffordshire has been a very happy hunting-ground for the Conservatives, who hold all of the county's parliamentary seats.  That changed here.  In a crowded field, the 2023 award for "result that made my jaw drop" goes collectively to Tamworth Labour, who won eight out of ten wards - their best result this century - to send Tamworth into No Overall Control: there are now 14 Conservative councillors, 10 Labour and 6 independents.
</p><p>
Other excellent results for Labour in Staffordshire saw the party gain control of the politically-iconic city of Stoke-on-Trent, which now has 29 Labour councillors against 14 Conservatives and just one independent.  East Staffordshire also has a Labour majority now, for the first time since 2003.  There was also an outstanding Labour performance in Staffordshire Moorlands where they are now the largest party, while the Tories went strongly backwards in Stafford where independents and the Greens hold the balance of power.  Labour and the Lib Dems made big gains in Lichfield, which is now hung, and this column correctly flagged that the Conservatives were likely to lose control of Cannock Chase.  That leaves only two Conservative-majority councils in Staffordshire: Newcastle-under-Lyme (which didn't poll this year) and South Staffordshire.
</p><p>
There were better Conservative performances in the urban West Midlands, where the party increased their majority in Solihull, lost only one seat in Dudley and made gains in Sandwell.  None of the six metropolitan boroughs up for election here had a change of control.
</p><p>
In the Warwickshire county council area, only Nuneaton and Bedworth - which wasn't up this year - remains in Conservative hands.  North Warwickshire district is now hung, with 17 Conservatives, 15 Labour councillors and 3 independents holding the balance of power.  This column correctly flagged up the Conservative loss of Rugby, although they still have half of the seats there.  Warwick district saw a Conservative bloodbath with 13 seat losses: the Greens are now the largest party here with 14 councillors against 11 Labour, 10 Lib Dems, just six Conservatives and three Whitnash Residents.  Stratford-on-Avon district was a Lib Dem gain from the Conservatives, who collapsed from 20 seats out of 35 to 12 out of 40.
</p><p>
But possibly the worst Conservative performance in this region came in the city of Worcester, where the party lost all seven seats they were defending.  Worcester is coming off the thirds cycle and going to all-out elections next year, so the Conservatives - who held a majority here up until May 2022 - are suddenly facing the prospect of wipeout in twelve months' time.  Labour are now the largest party in Worcester with 13 councillors, against 10 Greens, 8 Conservatives and 4 Lib Dems.
</p><p>
The rest of Worcestershire was brighter for the Conservatives, who benefited from the end of the Health Concern era in Kidderminster to gain overall control of Wyre Forest.  They also retained control of Redditch, although five gains for Labour means that the Conservative majority has been cut to 16-13, and still have a majority in the sprawling Wychavon district.  However, the Tories lost their majority in Bromsgrove: they are still the largest party on a rather fractured council, but only with 11 out of 31 seats.  Malvern Hills district remains hung, with independents now the largest group there.  The county council by-election in Malvern Chase was won by the Green Party with just 25% of the vote on a freak vote split; their candidate Malcolm Victory finally lived up to his name, gaining the seat from the Lib Dems.
</p><p>
There has been a Conservative recovery of sorts in Herefordshire, where the 2019 election saw an independent-led revolt against an unpopular council.  The Tories are now the largest party here again with 21 councillors but remain short of a majority; against them are 12 Lib Dems, 10 independents, 9 Greens and a Labour councillor.
</p><p>
<h2>South West</h2>
</p><p>
The county of Devon saw a lot of change at this election.  The standout performance came in Plymouth, where a chaotic (four leaders in two years) and controversial (tree-felling) Conservative minority administration crashed and burned; the Tories held just one of the nine seats they were defending, and Plymouth now has a Labour majority with 31 councillors against 18 Conservatives, 5 independents and two Greens.  Outside the city, the Liberal Democrats gained South Hams council from the Conservatives who lost more than half of their seats, while the Conservative majority in West Devon also disappeared.  There was, however, a bright spot for the Devon Conservatives in Torbay, where they defeated a Lib Dem-Independent coalition.
</p><p>
The Liberal Democrats recovered their majority in Teignbridge district and successfully held overall control in North Devon which they had gained through a by-election.  But the standout Lib Dem result in the county comes in Mid Devon, which has had a chaotic four years of independents trying and mostly failing to navigate a hung council; Mid Devon, much of which is part of the Tiverton and Honiton constituency which the Lib Dems gained at a parliamentary by-election last year, now has 33 Lib Dem councillors out of a possible 42.  The Honiton half of that seat is in East Devon district, where some coalition-building will need to be done after independent councillors fell back; this is now a very balanced council with 19 independents, 18 Lib Dems, 17 Conservatives, 3 Labour, 2 Greens and one seat gain for the continuing Liberal Party.
</p><p>
Another council where a controversial Conservative administration crashed and burned is the Frankenstein's monster of Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole.  The Tories lost 24 seats here, and the Lib Dems are now the largest party; the council stands at 28 Lib Dems, 20 independents and/or  localists, just 12 Conservatives, 11 Labour and 5 Greens.
</p><p>
The Conservatives must also be looking with some concern at the two marginal parliamentary seats in Swindon.  The par score here was for five Labour gains and a hung council; in fact Labour gained nine seats to win 16 out of a possible 19, and have convincingly gained control.  The new Swindon council has 33 Labour councillors, 22 Conservatives, 1 Lib Dem and 1 independent.
</p><p>
The mess in North Somerset council has not resolved itself, with Labour and the Greens making gains at the expense of independents and the Lib Dems.  The Conservatives held the 13 seats they were defending and are now the largest party, but with 11 independents, 10 Labour, 9 Lib Dems and 7 Greens also on the council some negotiations will need to be done for any administration to get near a majority.
</p><p>
On the far side of Bristol the Conservatives have lost control of South Gloucestershire council, which is now very balanced at 23 Conservatives, 20 Lib Dems, 17 Labour and an independent.  The Greens are now the largest party in the hung Forest of Dean district, with 15 seats against 11 independents, 5 Labour, 4 Conservatives and 4 Lib Dems.  The Conservatives held the Gloucestershire county council by-election in Highnam, but that was a rare bright spot for the party in Tewkesbury district where they mislaid a large majority; the Lib Dems are now, by some distance, the largest party in a hung council.
</p><p>
<h2>Eastern</h2>
</p><p>
I started my preview of the Eastern region by describing the fractured political scene in Bedford, which looks even more fractured now.  The Bedford mayoral election was gained by the Conservatives, whose candidate Tom Wootton defeated the Lib Dem mayor Dave Hodgson by just 145 votes, 15,747 to 15,602; the Tories and Lib Dems both polled 33% of the mayoral vote, with Labour on 24%.  Despite this, the Conservatives went backwards on Bedford council, whose composition is given by the BBC as 14 Conservatives, 14 Labour, 13 Lib Dems, 3 Greens and 2 independents.  On those figures, Mayor Wootton could have a serious problem in governing the borough because the opposition councillors have the two-thirds majority necessary to block his budget - some deals will need to be done.  In practice it's even worse for the Conservatives than that because one of their 14 councillors is Tom Wootton himself, who was elected not only as mayor but also as the ward councillor for Wyboston ward.  His council seat has been vacated and the Tories will have to defend a by-election in short order.
</p><p>
Wootton's gain in the Bedford mayoral election is cancelled out by a Conservative loss in Central Bedfordshire, where the Tories crashed from 41 seats out of 59 to just 20 out of 63.  Independent councillors are now the largest bloc here.
</p><p>
It was pretty much as you were in Cambridgeshire.  The Lib Dems fell short in their target of East Cambridgeshire, which split 15-13 in favour of the Conservatives - exactly the same score as four years ago.  For the second year in a row the Tories missed an opportunity to gain an overall majority in Peterborough, taking only one of the two seat gains they needed.  However, that is enough to give the Peterborough Conservatives 30 out of 60 seats - half of the council, and effective control on the mayoral casting vote.  The two county council by-elections were both holds, for the Conservatives in Soham South and Haddenham and for Labour in the Arbury division of Cambridge city.
</p><p>
Norfolk is looking a bit more politically diverse, with the Conservatives losing three of the council majorities they were defending - in King's Lynn and West Norfolk, Broadland, and Great Yarmouth.  The Tories are still the largest party in all these districts, although they lead Labour only 19-18 in Great Yarmouth where two independent councillors now hold the balance of power.
</p><p>
There are now no Conservative-controlled district councils in Suffolk, where a piece of electoral history has been made.  We now have the first-ever local government district with a majority for the Green Party: that's Mid Suffolk, where the Greens doubled their council group to 24 against 6 Conservatives and 4 Lib Dems.  The Greens are also the largest party in Babergh which remains hung.
</p><p>
Surprisingly, the Conservatives have lost control of both West Suffolk and East Suffolk councils, both of which are now looking rather balanced.  In the case of West Suffolk the running was made by Labour who gained twelve seats; the Tories now have 26 seats against 19 independents, 17 Labour and one each for the Greens and Lib Dems.  In East Suffolk the Conservatives crashed from 39 seats to 15 and are now in second place behind the Greens (16); there are also large caucuses for Labour (12) and the Lib Dems (11).
</p><p>
The Suffolk county council by-election result in Felixstowe Coastal won't be known until Tuesday, but the Tories must be rather worried about this one now: the two Felixstowe wards have returned Labour and Lib Dem councillors to East Suffolk council.  The other county council by-election, in the Priory Heath division of Ipswich, was an easy Labour hold.
</p><p>
Over the border in Essex, the coast is dominated by hung councils.  The Conservatives gained seats in Tendring district where they benefited from the final wipeout of UKIP, but they are still well short of a majority.  Little changed in Colchester, where the traffic-light coalition will probably continue.  Maldon council is now hung, with the Conservative/Independent duopoly broken; there are now 14 independent councillors, 10 Conservatives, 6 Lib Dems and 1 Labour.  Rochford council is now looking very balanced after the Conservatives lost three seats; that puts them on 14 against 16 independents or localists, 8 Lib Dems and a Green.  The Tories gained one seat in Southend-on-Sea but the Labour-led coalition will probably continue in office.  Castle Point is listed as hung by the BBC but in practice now has a very strong majority for the Canvey Island Independents and mainland independents, with the mainland group gaining seven seats from the Conservatives.
</p><p>
Away from the Essex coast, Braintree is still in Conservative hands but with a majority of just one seat; the Tories did make gains in Uttlesford from a low base, but the Residents for Uttlesford are still in control there.  The Tories went backwards in Epping Forest but they did defeat the only far-right councillor seeking re-election this year, as the British Democrats' Julian Leppert lost his seat in Waltham Abbey Paternoster ward.
</p><p>
The bright spot for the Essex Lib Dems came in Brentwood, where the Conservatives lost their majority and are now tied with the Lib Dems on 17 seats each; two Labour councillors and an independent hold the balance of power.
</p><p>
The Conservatives continue to make gains in Harlow and Basildon, although they underperformed the par score in Basildon by only gaining one seat.  Labour easily held the Essex county council by-election in Basildon Laindon Park and Fryerns.  Labour won a majority of the seats up for election in bankrupt Thurrock, but the workings of the thirds electoral system meant that a Tory loss of Thurrock this year was out of the question.
</p><p>
One of the Conservative candidates who lost in Thurrock was GB News contributor and student journalist Sophie Corcoran, who had been selected in one of the Tories' weakest wards in the borough and must have known from the beginning that she had little chance of winning.  Don't forget that many of the current senior figures in the Cabinet and Shadow Cabinet have in their CVs failed election campaigns in weak areas for their party from many years ago.  Corcoran is only young, and if she wants to persevere in politics I'm sure she'll learn from this experience and put those lessons to use if and when she gets a better opportunity for elected office.
</p><p>
In Hertfordshire, I described the Conservative majority in East Hertfordshire as large.  It turned out not to be bombproof.  In a district which returned a full slate of Conservative councillors just eight years ago, the Tories lost 27 seats and control of the council; the Greens came from virtually nowhere to become the largest party with 19 seats, against 16 Conservatives, 10 Lib Dems and 5 Labour.
</p><p>
The Labour/Lib Dem coalition in North Hertfordshire gained five seats from the Conservatives, with Labour becoming the largest party on the council.  We might well see similar coalition negotiations down the A1 corridor in Welwyn Hatfield, where the Tories lost three seats and their council majority; Welwyn Hatfield now has 22 Conservatives, 14 Lib Dems and 12 Labour councillors.
</p><p>
The Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden must be looking with some concern at the results in his Hertsmere constituency, where the Conservatives lost control for the first time in many years.  They lost 13 seats, roughly evenly to Labour (in Borehamwood and Potters Bar) and the Lib Dems (in Bushey); the council now stands at 16 Conservatives, 14 Labour and 9 Lib Dems.
</p><p>
I had suggested that the Western Hertfordshire Lib Dems might fancy a go at Tory-controlled Dacorum, which was their only remaining target council; and they delivered on that.  Dacorum now has a Lib Dem majority, with 28 Lib Dem councillors against 18 Conservatives, 3 Labour and two independents.  That leaves only one Tory-controlled district in Hertfordshire: Broxbourne, which was the first district to finish counting this year, saw no seat changes and the Conservative majority there is under no threat whatsoever.
</p><p>
<h2>South East</h2>
</p><p>
Moving into the south-east region we now come to the seat of the worst Conservative losses in this election.  Of the councils up for election across Oxfordshire, Hampshire, Surrey, Sussex and Kent, just seven still have Conservative majorities: New Forest, Test Valley, Havant, Rushmoor, Reigate and Banstead, Sevenoaks, and Dartford.
</p><p>
One council that's no longer on that list is Cherwell district, covering north-eastern Oxfordshire including the towns of Banbury and Bicester.  The Conservatives could only afford to lose one seat here and keep their majority; I had placed a par score of three Conservative losses here, and in fact they lost six seats.  The Conservatives are still the largest party on Cherwell council with 20 seats out of 48, but there are the numbers for a traffic-light coalition of Labour (12), the Lib Dems (10) and Greens (3) if such a thing could be negotiated.
</p><p>
The Lib Dems were the clear winners in the three other Oxfordshire districts up for election.  They are now the largest party on the hung West Oxfordshire council, remain firmly in control of the Vale of White Horse and can now dump their Green coalition partners after winning an overall majority on South Oxfordshire council.  Until 2019 South Oxfordshire and the Vale both had Conservative majorities; the Tories now hold a grand total of one seat on both of those councils.
</p><p>
There was a similar Tory bloodbath in the New City of Milton Keynes, where the Conservatives lost six of the eight seats they were defending.  Labour are now the largest party on the council with 25 seats, against 17 Conservatives and 15 Lib Dems.  Milton Keynes council is almost always hung, but there is now a realistic chance of a Labour majority here next year.
</p><p>
The six Berkshire districts saw wild swings.  As suggested by this column, West Berkshire council was a Lib Dem gain from the Conservatives; the Lib Dems also gained control of Windsor and Maidenhead, and they are now the largest party on Wokingham council.
</p><p>
In possibly the biggest upset of this cycle, Bracknell Forest council now has a Labour majority; the Tories lost 27 seats here to an electoral pact of Labour, the Lib Dems and the Greens who had carefully organised so that most wards were a straight fight between the Conservatives and one of those parties.  It worked for Labour, who now have 22 seats against 10 Conservatives, 7 Lib Dems and 2 Greens.  Paul Bettison, who had been the council leader for 26 unbroken years since 1997 and was one of the longest-serving council leaders in the country, went down to defeat at the ballot box.
</p><p>
The one good piece of news from Berkshire from a Conservative point of view came in Slough.  Slough council is effectively bankrupt and has had to be bailed out by central government with an inflation-busting council tax increase imposed on its residents.  The voters clearly did not like that, and the Labour majority in Slough has disappeared.  The Conservatives came from virtually nowhere to win half of the seats, 21 against 18 Labour and 3 Lib Dem councillors, which might well leave in the council in a state of deadlock.  The AGM, at which the mayor and the mayoral casting vote will be decided, could be crucial for the future political direction of Slough.

The thirds electoral system has proved crucial to continued Conservative control in Rushmoor, where Labour won eight of the thirteen wards this year but the Conservatives still hold 23 out of 39 thanks to good results in earlier years.  Further down the M3 corridor, Hart will continue to be run by the Lib Dem/Community Campaign coalition while control of Basingstoke and Deane council is up for grabs.  This presently has a Conservative minority administration, but the Tories lost four seats this year and are now down 23 out of 54; the opposition councillors are 11 independents, 10 Labour, 9 Lib Dems and a Green.
</p><p>
Another council to go hung this year was East Hampshire, where the Conservatives have mislaid a large majority: East Hants now has 19 Conservatives, 14 Lib Dems, 7 independents, 2 Greens and a Labour councillor.  Further down the A3 the Tories lost five seats in Havant but that only brings them down to 30 seats out of 38; the Tories also held the county council by-election in Purbrook and Stakes South.
</p><p>
Portsmouth remains hung, with big gains this year for an independent slate and major Conservative losses: the council, which is presently run by a Lib Dem minority, now has 18 Lib Dem councillors, 9 independents, 8 Conservatives and 7 Labour.  As suggested by this column, there is now a much larger Labour majority in Southampton: currently 35 out of 51, which doesn't include the three seats in Coxford ward where the poll had to be abandoned after a candidate died on election day.
</p><p>
The only Conservative-controlled district in Sussex now is Adur - which wasn't up this year.  In West Sussex, Chichester and Horsham councils now have Lib Dem majorities; Arun council remains hung, with big gains for Labour and the Greens and with the Tories consolidating their position as the largest party; Mid Sussex council, which returned a full slate of Conservatives in 2015, is now hung with the Lib Dems as the largest party; and Labour increased their majority over the Conservatives on Crawley council to 20-16 as the Tory situation there continues to deteriorate.  The Conservatives did hold the West Sussex county council by-election, in the East Grinstead Meridian division.
</p><p>
The longstanding three-way fight for control of Brighton and Hove council has finally produced a winner - and it's been won by Labour, who have an overall majority with 38 councillors against 7 Greens, 6 Conservatives and 3 independents.  That spells the end of the Green minority administration here, but there was better news for the Greens in neighbouring Lewes: they are now the largest party in a hung council, with 17 seats against 15 Lib Dems and 9 Labour.  The Conservatives, who were the largest party across Lewes district in the 2019 elections, have been completely wiped out - 19 councillors lost.
</p><p>
Tory losses were even heavier (25) in Wealden district, where they are now the fourth-largest group in a hung council.  Wealden council now has 13 Lib Dems, 11 Greens, 10 independents, 9 Conservatives and 2 Labour councillors.  The Tories also lost ground in Rother district, mostly to the benefit of Labour; Rother now has 10 Conservatives, 10 independents, 8 Labour, 7 Lib Dems and 3 Greens.
</p><p>
Surrey continues to be a Conservative disaster area.  The Tories did recover a little ground in Guildford district which was previously run by a Lib Dem and Residents coalition; but the Lib Dems now have 25 out of 48 seats and they can govern alone.  The Lib Dems have also become the largest party on Waverley district, the constituency of the Chancellor Jeremy Hunt; they now have 22 seats, against 15 independents and/or residents, 10 Conservatives, 2 Labour and a Green.
</p><p>
The cabinet minister responsible for local government is Michael Gove, who might well not be happy with the Conservatives losing 12 of the 18 seats they were defending in his Surrey Heath constituency.  Surrey Heath now has a Lib Dem majority with 21 out of 35 seats, and the Lib Dems have a chance to increase that score when the postponed poll in Frimley Green ward takes place (probably next month).
</p><p>
The par score for the Conservatives in Runnymede had them losing three seats leaving a majority of one: they did indeed lose the three wards they identified plus New Haw, which went to the Lib Dems.  That leaves Runnymede as a hung council with the Conservatives on 20 against 6 Residents, 5 independents, 4 Labour, 4 Lib Dems and 2 Greens.
</p><p>
The financial instability of Spelthorne council looks likely to be matched by continuing political instability.  The Conservatives had won a majority in 2019, which then fell apart leading to a chaotic four years with council control seesawing between a succession of unstable coalitions.  Judging from the 2023 results here we'll probably get more of that: there are now just 12 Conservatives, 10 Lib Dems, 7 independents, 7 Labour and 3 Greens, with 20 needed for a majority.
</p><p>
The Lib Dems have become the largest group on Elmbridge council, the constituency of the former justice secretary Dominic Raab, where local politics is complicated by the presence of a large number of strong residents' associations.  The Residents and the Lib Dems are in coalition, but the Lib Dems might now seek to take over the leadership with their 19 councillors; there are now 17 Residents and 12 Conservatives.  Also here, the Liberal Democrats gained the Surrey county council by-election in Walton South and Oatlands from the Conservatives.
</p><p>
As I suggested in the Preview, Reigate and Banstead is the last Surrey district with a Conservative majority; but this is now clearly under threat.  The Tory lead is now down to just one seat; they have 23 councillors against 11 Greens, 6 Residents, 3 Lib Dems, 1 Labour and 1 independent.  The Conservatives continue to lose ground in Tandridge, where they have now fallen to third place on the hung council; they lost two more seats to the independents and residents who are running the show.
</p><p>
Last but not least we come to Kent, where Dartford saw one of the Conservatives' best performances in the south east region: the Tories were defending 29 seats out of 42, and came through with no net change.  In Sevenoaks the Tories lost ground to the Lib Dems, but still have a majority.
</p><p>
The rest of Kent tells a rather different story.  The Labour administration in Gravesham has been re-elected with a majority of 22-17 over the Conservatives.  The Tories have also lost control of the Medway towns: Medway council was gained by Labour, who now have 33 seats against 22 Conservatives and 4 independents.
</p><p>
Further along the north Kent coast, Swale district was previously a hung council led by the Swale Independents; not much has changed in that regard, but Labour are now the largest party here with 15 seats against 12 Conservatives, 12 independents, 5 Lib Dems and 3 Greens.  The Tories won the Kent county by-election on the Isle of Sheppey, but with only a third of the vote; they came through the middle of an opposition vote split between the Swale Independents and Labour.  Whitstable and Herne Bay are included in the Canterbury district where the Conservatives have crashed and burned, losing 15 seats; Labour are now clearly the largest party on a hung council with 18 seats, against 9 Lib Dems, 8 Conservatives and 4 Greens.  Last but not least, the long-standing political instability of Thanet council may finally have been resolved with these elections returning a Labour majority; there are now 30 Labour councillors against 17 Conservatives, 5 Greens and 4 independents.
</p><p>
In another result which this column did not see coming, Dover council now has a Labour majority after the party gained five seats: it's only a small one, with 17 seats against 14 Conservatives and an independent, but it's a majority nonetheless.  In Folkestone and Hythe district the Conservative-UKIP-Independent coalition has clearly been defeated: regular readers of this column will recall that the Green Party won a county council by-election in Hythe two months ago, and the Greens are now the largest party on Folkestone and Hythe council.  They have 11 seats, Labour have 10, and there are five Conservatives, 2 independents and 2 Lib Dems.  With that result, we mark the defeat of the final UK Independence Party councillor in Britain's local government; UKIP are now officially a spent force with no remaining elected officials.
</p><p>
That leaves four councils in inland Kent, three of which returned Conservative majorities at their last elections, all of which are now hung.  The Tories lost a majority in Ashford due to by-election losses over the last four years; they are now much further away from a majority after big gains at this election for the Greens and Labour.  Ashford council now stands at 19 Conservatives, 11 Labour, 9 independents and 8 Greens.  The par score in Maidstone was for the Cosnervatives to hold their majority; but they lost four seats, putting them on 24 out of 55.  The opposition stands at 12 Lib Dems, 10 independents, 6 Labour and 3 Greens; with a number of the independents being Lib Dem defectors, it might prove difficult to put an anti-Conservative coalition together.  In Tonbridge and Malling the Conservatives crashed from 39 seats out of 54 to 20 out of 44, costing them their majority; the opposition consists of 11 Lib Dems, 8 Greens and 3 Labour.
</p><p>
And in the spiritual home of disgust, the Conservatives continued to lose ground.  I asked in the preview "did you ever think youâ€™d see the day when Labour won more seats in Tunbridge Wells than the Conservatives?"  It happened last year, and it's happened again as the Tories lost two more seats.  There are now 17 Lib Dems, 12 independent or Tunbridge Wells Alliance councillors, 11 Conservatives and 8 Labour councillors in Tunbridge Wells.
</p><p>
So what comes next?  Another year of local by-elections, that's what.  There are three remaining local by-elections scheduled for this month, all of which are on different days of the week for various reasons: so Andrew's Previews will return on <em>Wednesday</em> 17th May 2023 for the next local by-election, in Gloucestershire.  Stay tuned for that.
