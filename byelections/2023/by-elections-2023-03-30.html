<h2>Westgate</h2>

Gloucester council; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Dawn Melvin.

Our other English by-election today takes place in a very historic location, as we come to the centre of the ancient city of Gloucester.  This was founded by the Romans in the first century AD as <em>Glevum</em>, a fortress guarding the lowest bridging-point of the River Severn.  The "bright fort" was built in the typical Roman style, enclosed by a rectangular wall with rounded corners and a gate in the middle of each side.  Even now Eastgate Street, Northgate Street, Southgate Street and Westgate Street all meet at Gloucester Cross, at the centre of the original Roman fort.

After the Romans left, Gloucester remained an important location in Mercia, Wessex and then England.  King Henry III, while still a child, was crowned in Gloucester Cathedral in 1216; his grandson Edward II was buried here in 1327 following his death, in suspicious circumstances, at Berkeley Castle further down the Severn valley.  The cathedral will be this year's host of the Three Choirs Festival, which rotates between here, Hereford and Worcester; and it has recently come to the attention of a new generation worldwide as a location for the <em>Harry Potter</em> films.

Gloucester Cathedral is located to the north of the mediaeval Westgate Street, which gives its name to the ward covering Gloucester city centre.  Close by is the Tailor of Gloucester's House, used as the setting for a Beatrix Potter story; while on the street itself can be found the city's folk museum and the Shire Hall, headquarters of Gloucestershire county council.

Westgate Street continues through a modern one-way system to Westgate Bridge, which until 1966 (with the opening of the motorway Severn Bridge, many miles downstream) was part of the lowest road crossing of the Severn.  This bridge has been replaced several times over the centuries, and the three current bridges (one for inbound traffic, one for outbound traffic, and a footbridge in between) are modern structures dating from 2000.  The Westgate Bridge takes travellers to Alney Island, which lies between two channels of the Severn; traffic for points west has to complete the crossing of the river on the far side of the island at Over Bridge.  Here a 1970s structure has superseded a rather flat 1820s stone arch bridge erected by Thomas Telford, which is too narrow and weak to csrry modern road traffic.  More on that theme later.

The Westgate ward also extends to the south of the city centre to take in Hempsted.  This is a village which wasn't incorporated into the city until 1966; part of the reason for that is that Hempsted is cut off from the rest of the city by the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal.  Once the broadest and deepest canal in the world, this channel preserved Gloucester's status as an inland port by allowing seagoing ships to bypass a number of loops in the Severn.  The canal terminates at Gloucester Basin, on the southern edge of the city centre.

The city of Gloucester has returned MPs to Parliament continuously since the thirteenth century, and in modern times it's a seat which has voted for the winning party nationally at every election from 1979 onwards.  Since 2010 the MP here has been Conservative backbencher Richard Graham.

The Gloucester parliamentary seat covers all but one of the wards of Gloucester city council, which has had a Conservative majority since 2015.  In 2016 Gloucester moved away from the thirds electoral system and started electing its councillors on an all-out basis.  This gives the city a rather unusual electoral cycle, because most of the non-metropolitan English districts who elect all of their councillors are up for election in May this year; however, Gloucester city council's next election is not due until 2024.

The last Gloucester city council elections took place in 2021 and returned an increased Conservative majority with 26 Conservative councillors, 10 Lib Dems and 3 Labour.  The Conservatives have since lost a by-election to the Lib Dems (<em>Andrew's Previews 2021</em>, page 457), but they managed to hold a by-election in Tuffley ward last October, at the electoral pit of the Truss administration, thanks to a very even split in the opposition vote between Labour and the Lib Dems.

Westgate ward is part of the Conservative majority, and it re-elected the Conservative slate in 2021 with 40% of the vote against 28% for the Lib Dems and 20% for Labour.  Some of that Conservative score was clearly a personal vote for Pam Tracey, who topped the poll some way ahead of her running-mates Paul Toleman and Dawn Melvin.  Tracey has been the county councillor for the area for some years, and on the same day she was successfully re-elected to Gloucestershire county council in the Hempsted and Westgate division.  This by-election is to replace Conservative councillor Dawn Melvin, who stood down from the council in February for private family reasons; she had represented Westgate ward since 2016.

Defending for the Conservatives is Peter Sheehy, who has run businesses in Gloucester city centre for the last 50 years; he is currently co-owner of the Turks Head Inn.  Sheehy was a county council candidate two years ago, finishing second to the Lib Dems in Kingsholm and Wootton division which takes in two small corners of this ward.  The Lib Dems have reselected Rebecca Trimnell who was runner-up here at the last election in 2021; she works for a charity helping people with dementia.  The Labour candidate will be hoping to connect with the electorate for longer than a brief encounter in the polling booth: Trevor Howard is retired from a career in the nuclear sector.  Also standing are Benjamin "Lord Benny" Baker for the Official Monster Raving Loony Party and Gill White in a rare local election outing for Reform UK.

<h2>Aethwy</h2>

Isle of Anglesey council, North Wales; caused by the death of Plaid Cymru councillor Alun Mummery.

Let me finish for the week by taking you to the Menai Strait., the narrow stretch of tidal water which divides Anglesey from the Welsh mainland.  The waters are treacherous, with strong currents flowing in either direction depending on the state of the tide.  The central section of the Menai, known as the Swellies, is particularly turbulent: whirlpools, shoals and small islands lie ready to trap even the most experienced of sailors.

This natural obstacle is a problem for travellers, and Anglesey gets rather a lot of them.  The island has a very different economic profile to Gwynedd over the water.  It's relatively flat and thus much more suitable for agriculture, and Anglesey's main town - Holyhead - is a major port at one of the narrowest points of the Irish Sea, with ferries arriving and departing for Dublin and Dún Laoghaire several times a day.  A fixed link to Holyhead would be a major prize for whoever could develop it first.

Enter the "Colossus of Roads", the great civil engineer Thomas Telford, who spent much of his later years developing and improving the main road from London to Holyhead.  His route is still followed to a large extent by the modern A5.  Threading a road through the Welsh mountains from Llangollen to Bangor without any major gradients was a serious achievement for Telford, but the crossing of the Menai Strait was quite another matter.  His solution was the Menai Suspension Bridge, erected over the narrowest point of the strait and opened in 1826; with a span of 176 metres, it was at the time the longest suspension bridge in the world.  Two decades later, some distance to the west at the other end of the Swillies, Robert Stephenson raised the Britannia Bridge to carry the railway line to Holyhead.

These fixed links with the mainland have proven to be fragile as time has gone on.  The Britannia Bridge was badly damaged by a fire in 1970, and subsequently rebuilt as a double-deck structure: trains now run on the lower deck, with traffic on the A55 expressway using the upper deck.  The Menai Suspension Bridge, iconic though it is, is almost 200 years old now and is showing its age; as with Over Bridge on the Severn which we covered earlier, Telford's bridge is too small for large vehicles to fit through it and now has a rather severe weight limit.  The Menai Suspension Bridge was closed without warning in October 2022 for essential maintenance work, and didn't reopen until February 2023; that forced all traffic between Anglesey and the mainland onto the Britannia Bridge, which is the only single-carriageway section of the A55 and as such can be a bottleneck on the road.  Plans to relieve both bridges by constructing a third Menai crossing, slightly to the east of the Britannia Bridge, fell victim last month to the Welsh Government's cancellation of all roadbuilding scheems in Wales on climate change grounds.

The Menai Bridges transformed the economy of Anglesey, not least because the bridgehead of Telford's crossing at Porthaethwy was brought within commuting distance of the city of Bangor.  A town grew up, which still bears the name Porthaethwy in the Welsh language but in the English tongue is simply called Menai Bridge.  With 2,445 electors on the roll, Menai Bridge is the fifth-largest town on Anglesey.  It has an unusual cultural legacy: <em>Rownd a Rownd</em>, a Welsh-language soap opera which S4C have been broadcasting since 1995, is filmed in Menai Bridge.

The Britannia Bridge crosses from the mainland to a village which, with 2,422 electors, is only marginally smaller than Menai Bridge.  Llanfairpwllgwyngyll's claim to fame is that it was the location for the first British meeting of the Women's Institute, which took place here in September 1915.  But you probably know it for its notoriously long name, which spills over 51 Welsh letters (some of which are digraphs) and 58 letters in English.  In an 1869 publicity stunt the railway station was given the name of Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch; this station has since been renamed to the rather more manageable Llanfairpwll, and it is the first stop after Bangor for local trains on the North Wales Coast line.  The Welsh railway station with the longest name today is, as this column has previously noted, Rhoose Cardiff Internaional Airport.

As can be seen from a notorious clip on ITV's <em>The Chase</em> from some years ago, Llanfair PG's name (which hasn't really settled down in local use even now) is rather more well-known to the outside world than its location.  But don't try this question on Mark "the Beast" Labbett now, because he won't get caught out again.  That's how quiz professionals work.

Menai Bridge and Llanfair Pwllgwyngyll are the two main settlements within Aethwy ward, which also takes in the rural community of Penmynydd to the north-west and Pili Palas, a small zoo which is particularly noted for its butterfly house.  The name of this ward recalls the former Aethwy Rural District, which was created in 1894 to cover parishes which were previously administered from over the water as part of the Bangor Rural Sanitary District.  Even then, Bangor was the main economic centre for the area.

However, proposals in the 2010s from the Boundary Commission for Wales to combine Anglesey and Bangor into the same parliamentary seat, as part of an intended reduction of MPs in Wales (which is over-represented in the current House of Commons), fell on very stony ground locally.  After those reviews failed, the Johnson government enacted changes to the law around parliamentary boundary reviews which made the parliamentary constituency of Ynys Môn a "protected" constituency, shielding it from the large cut in Wales' parliamentary representation which should take effect by the time of the next Westminster poll.  It was of course a complete coincidence that the change in the law to preserve the Ynys Môn constituency came after that seat was gained by the Conservatives in the 2019 general election.

Anglesey has been a single parliamentary seat since 1885, when the Beaumaris District of Boroughs was abolished.  Over the last century Anglesey/Ynys Môn has returned MPs from all four Welsh parties, but the Senedd constituency has been in the hands of Plaid Cymru continuously since the creation of the original Welsh Assembly in 1999.  Since a 2013 by-election the MS for the island has been Rhun ap Iorwerth, the deputy leader of Plaid Cymru, who is a former pupil of the Ysgol David Hughes secondary school in Menai Bridge.  Ysgol David Hughes has a rather long list of notable former pupils who include the current Conservative MP Stuart Andrew, the former UKIP Wales leader Nathan Gill, the singer Aled Jones, the <em>Rocketman</em> actor Taron Egerton, the veteran Wales goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey and two of the Super Furry Animals.

The local authority here is the Isle of Anglesey County Coucnil, based at the centre of the island in Llangefni.  This has traditionally been dominated by independent councillors, but their star fell somewhat as a result of serious political infighting which led to the 2012 Anglesey elections being postponed by a year.  The 2013 and 2017 Anglesey elections were close between the independent councillors and Plaid Cymru, but in 2022 Plaid made major gains on the island to win a majority on Anglesey council for the first time.

Aethwy ward is part of the Plaid majority, and Plaid Cymru have held all three seats here since 2017.  In 2022 the Plaid slate was re-elected with 51% of the vote in Aethwy ward, against 24% for Labour and 13% for the Conservatives.

Top of the poll here in 2013 and 2017 was Alun Mummery, who was first elected to the county council in a July 2012 by-election for Gwyngyll ward, which then covered the eastern half of Llanfairpwllgwyngyll.  He was an independent candidate then, but was re-elected in 2013, 2017 and 2022 with the Plaid nomination.  Mummery, who passed away just before Christmas at the age of 80, had previously worked for the county council as a rent collector.  His passion was football, and he helped to run the local team Llanfairpwll FC for over half a century.

Big shoes to fill for the defending Plaid Cymru candidate Sonia Williams, who is a business development manager and Menai Bridge town councillor.  The Labour candidate is Karl Jones, who gives an address in the village of Tyn-y-gongl some distance to the north.  Standing again for the Conservatives is Steven Green, another Menai Bridge town councillor who was their lead candidate here last year.  A four-strong ballot paper is completed by Sarah Jackson of the Lib Dems, who contest Aethwy ward for the first time in ten years.

There are no council by-elections scheduled for the next two weeks, so this column will now take a break for an extended Easter holiday before returning on 20th April.  But don't think you'll be getting rid of me that easily.  I'll be hard at work behind the scenes getting everything together for the extended previews of the 4th May local elections, and I've also found time to appear on your television screens.  Tune in to Channel 5 at 18:30 on Good Friday (yes, it's a bank holiday so you have no excuse not to tune in) to watch your columnist answering quiz questions in pursuit of a cash prize.
