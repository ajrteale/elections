One by-election on Wednesday 6th September 2023:
</p><p>
<h2>Ashford Town</h2>
</p><p>
Spelthorne council, Surrey; caused by the resignation of Green Party councillor Andrew McLuskey.
</p><p>
Yes, it's a Wednesday.  So why not have a by-election?  There's no rule that says by-elections have to be held on the traditional Thursday; any working day will do, and Spelthorne council - which tends to schedule its full council meetings on Thursdays - seems have got into a habit of holding its council by-elections on Wednesdays.
</p><p>
So it is we kick the traditional busy time of autumn off in Ashford, in the county of Surrey.  Or is it?  The Spelthorne local government district is the only part of Surrey which lies north of the River Thames; historically it was thus part of the county of Middlesex, until Middlesex ceased to exist in local government with the creation of Greater London in 1965.  Spelthorne was one of the few areas of Middlesex which escaped becoming part of Greater London, and seemingly for want of better ideas it then became part of Surrey.
</p><p>
This change of county hasn't been accepted by everyone, and unfortunately that creates a lot of confusion because of the need to disambiguate this Ashford from the larger and more important town in Kent with the same name.  To take a couple of examples, the local railway station (on the Waterloo-Staines line) appears in the National Rail timetable with the name "Ashford (Surrey)", while the local non-league football team (who play in the Isthmian League South Central Division, four levels below the EFL) are registered with the FA as "Ashford Town (Middlesex)".  Royal Mail have basically given up on counties these days and just tell letter-writers to use the postcode.  No doubt this confusion warms the heart of the Lord of the Manor of Ashford Russell Grant, the well-known TV astrologer, who bought that title in the 1990s a few years after he founded the Association of British Counties.
</p><p>
The Surrey/Middlesex Ashford may have escaped being absorbed by Greater London, but it still lies within the M25 motorway and is very much part of the capital's urban sprawl, about a mile or two to the east of Staines.  The census return paints a picture of a lower middle-class area whose economy is heavily dependent on Heathrow Airport to the north: Ashford Town ward is within the top 60 wards in England and Wales for those working in the transport or storage sector (12.8%) and in the top 75 wards for what the ONS class as "intermediate" occupations (16.2%).  The ward takes in the town centre and lies mostly to the south of the railway line: this means that within the ward boundary is HMP Bronzefield, which is the largest women's prison in Europe with capacity to hold over 500 of the UK's most notorious female prisoners.
</p><p>
The local authority here is Spelthorne council which, Russell Grant notwithstanding, is a district under Surrey county council.  As this column has related on a few previous occasions, Spelthorne council has had a lot of political instability over the last few years as a result of the majority Conservative group elected in 2019 suffering a damaging split.  We're probably in for more of the same in this term, after the May 2023 Spelthorne elections returned a very balanced council.  The Tories remain the largest party, but are now well short of a majority with just 12 seats against 10 Lib Dems, 8 independents, 7 Labour and 3 Greens.
</p><p>
A coalition of the Lib Dems and the independent councillors is now running the show under an independent leader, and that coalition is hopefully starting to get to grips with the council's large property portfolio.  Spelthorne is one of those councils that did a lot of property speculation in the last decade, in their case focusing on large office and commercial buildings within the borough and the surrounding area - the council's largest asset is the extensive BP office complex in Sunbury, on the books at over £380 million.  The upside of this is that the council has a very healthy rental income; the downside is that they are servicing £1,000 million in debt, and with recent interest rises it remains to be seen whether this will be sustainable in the long-term.
</p><p>
Ashford Town used to be part of the borough's Conservative majority.  The current ward boundaries date from 2003, and the Tories got their full slate in at all of the elections from 2003 to 2019 with the exception of 2011, when the Conservative slate was opposed only by a single independent candidate who topped the poll.  Things changed in May 2023, when the ward's three seats split three ways: independent candidate Michelle Arnold topped the poll with 29% of the vote, the Tories held just one of their seats with 26%, and the third seat went to the Green Party with 24%.  The other 21% went to Labour.
</p><p>
The ward is split roughly evenly between two divisions of Surrey county council.  At the last county elections in 2021 Ashford division was gained from the Conservatives by independent candidate Joanne Sexton, who is now the leader of Spelthorne council; while the Staines South and Ashford West division remained in Conservative hands.  The Conservative MP here since 2010 has been the <em>University Challenge</em> champion Kwasi Kwarteng, whose disastrous five-and-a-half weeks as Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Truss government will not be forgotten for a while.
</p><p>
This fascinating ward will be defended in the by-election by the third-placed Green Party.  Their councillor Andrew McLuskey lasted longer in office than Kwarteng's chancellorship, but not much longer; by the time his resignation letter went in at the end of July he had already quit the council's Green group and was sitting as an Independent Green.
</p><p>
Defending for the Green Party is Stuart Whitmore, a retired fireman who appeared in this column last year: he was elected to Spelthorne council in a May 2022 by-election for Laleham and Shepperton Green ward (<em>Andrew's Previews 2022</em>, page 224), but lost re-election in that ward in May as the Conservatives took his seat back.  The council's independent group have firmly endorsed independent candidate John Enright, who fought Ashford East ward in May and is retired after a career in public sector finance-related roles; a gain for him would improve the position of the ruling Independent-Lib Dem coalition, which is currently two seats short of a council majority.  The Conservatives have reselected Paul Woodward, who was one of their two losing candidates here in May.  Also returning from May is Labour candidate Mark Kluth, who currently works as a manager for a railway firm.  Two other candidates complete an all-male ballot paper: they are Paul Couchman for the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition and Rory O'Brien for Reform UK.

Regrettably, there has been a late change to today's lineup of by-elections following the sad death late last month of Toby Murcott.  He was an independent candidate for the Golden Valley South by-election of Herefordshire council, which was scheduled for today.  That poll has now been postponed and will take place at a later date.  This column sends its condolences to Mr Murcott's family and friends.
</p><p>
That leaves six polls taking place on 7th September 2023:
</p><p>
<h2>Thorpe St Andrew North West</h2>
</p><p>
Broadland council, Norfolk; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Drew Moore.
</p><p>
Our first poll this week is in a ward which this column paid a visit to less than a year ago (<em>Andrew's Previews 2022</em>, page 462), but where the political context has completely changed in the last eleven months.  We've come to the big city of Norwich - or not, as the case may be.  The Norwich city boundaries haven't changed for a very long time, and many of the city's northern suburbs actually lie within the Broadland district even though they are very much part of the city's built-up area.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/broadland-thorpe-st-andrew-nw-2023.png" alt="Broadland, Thorpe St Andrew NW" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
This includes Thorpe St Andrew, which lies immediately east of the city boundary on the north bank of the River Yare.  We are literally over the road from the social housing and tower blocks of Norwich's Heartsease estate; but Thorpe St Andrew North West ward, while not being a particularly middle-class area, is a lot higher on the social scale than the Heartsease.
</p><p>
Which perhaps explains why Thorpe St Andrew has been an area where the Conservatives have traditionally dominated.  North West ward returned a full slate of Conservative councillors at every election from 2004 (when the current boundaries were introduced) to 2019 when the Conservative slate had a 56-29 lead over Labour.  The Conservatives also hold the Woodside division of Norfolk county council, which covers this ward.  The Parliamentary Boundary Commission have not been fooled by the fact that this ward is outside the Norwich city limits and they have sensibly placed the area within the Norwich North constituency; this has been held since a 2009 by-election by the Conservatives' Chloe Smith.
</p><p>
All this is something which this column wrote in the 20th October 2022 edition.  Five days later, my statement that Smith had "joined the Cabinet last month as Work and Pensions secretary" was out of date.  We were at this point in the final throes of the Truss premiership; when Rishi Sunak took over as Prime Minister the following week, Chloe Smith went back to the backbenches.  She will be standing down at the next general election, at which point Labour will certainly have their eye on gaining her Norwich North seat.
</p><p>
The by-election which I wrote about in October last year saw Labour overturn a Conservative majority of 27 percentage points in Thorpe St Andrew North West to win with a 52-38 margin, a swing of over 20% since 2019.  We may well have been in the final throes of the Truss premiership at the time, but the national poll ratings for the Conservatives have not noticeably recovered and this proved to be a harbinger of things to come in the Broadland district.
</p><p>
In May 2023 the Tories lost their majority on Broadland council, falling from 33 to 21 seats out of a possible 47, and that cost them power.  All the other councillors (14 Lib Dems, 8 Labour and 4 Greens) have joined together in a traffic-light coalition, under a Lib Dem leader.  The result in Thorpe St Andrew North West was closer than in the October 2022 by-election, but a Labour lead of 48-42 was enough for Labour to take all three seats in the ward.
</p><p>
Eight weeks later, the Labour group found themselves a man down following the resignation of Labour councillor Drew Moore, who indicated that he could not balance his new democratic duties with a new job.  Moore had won the final seat in the ward with a majority of just 33 votes over the lead Conservative Peter Berry, so Labour have work to do to hold this by-election.
</p><p>
Defending for Labour is Carol Ferris, who stood in the other Thorpe St Andrew ward (South East) in May; she was elected to Thorpe St Andrew town council, but missed out on a seat on Broadland council then.  Another Thorpe St Andrew town councillor on the ballot is the Conservatives' Peter Berry, who finished as runner-up in the 2022 by-election and the 2023 Broadland district election in North West ward.  Completing the ballot paper is Victor Morgan for the Liberal Democrats.

<h2>Bread Street</h2>
</p><p>
City of London Court of Aldermen; caused by the resignation of Alderman Sir William Russell.
</p><p>
We now come to the only local government unit in the UK which still has Aldermen, the City of London.  There are 25 Aldermen of the City, one for each ward, who are the senior councillors from whose ranks the Lord Mayor of London is chosen.
</p><p>
Since the nineteenth century Lord Mayors of London usually serve for one year in the top role and that's it.  However, an exception was made in recent years for William Russell, the 692nd Lord Mayor, who had the bad luck to take the role on in November 2019.  With the COVID pandemic striking shortly afterwards and preventing the City's normal mayoral elections at Michaelmas 2020 from taking place, it was decided that the best option would be to re-elect Russell for a second term of office.
</p><p>
The last Lord Mayor to be re-elected was William Cubitt in 1860-62.  Cubitt was an engineer, Conservative MP and architect whose surviving works in London include Fishmonger's Hall in the City, the Covent Garden market building and the east London district of Cubitt Town, which is named after him.  It remains to be seen what effect Sir William Russell, who was knighted in 2022 after his two years were finally over, will have on London.  Sir William is a financier from a family with a long tradition of serving in the City's government: four members of his mother's Bowater family have been Lord Mayor, including Sir William's grandfather Sir Ian Bowater (1969-70) and great-grandfather Sir Frank Bowater (1938-39).  The actor Damian Lewis (Richard Winters in <em>Band of Brothers</em>, Henry VIII in <em>Wolf Hall</em>) is his half-brother.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/city-bread-st.png" alt="City of London, Bread St" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Sir William Russell represents one of the City of London's smaller wards.  Bread Street ward surrounds St Paul's Cathedral on three sides; major features of the ward include the major shopping/office complex at One New Change, the recently-redeveloped Paternoster Square (home these days to the London Stock Exchange), and the St Paul's Cathedral School which educates and houses the cathedral's boy choristers.  Many former St Paul's Cathedral School pupils have gone on to greater things, and not just in music: the former England cricket captain Alastair Cook and the actor Sir Simon Russell Beale were choristers here in their younger days.  St Paul's underground station, a stop on the Central Line behind Paternoster Square, lies on the northern boundary of the ward.  Bread Street itself is the ward's eastern boundary, and is so-named because in mediaeval times it was the city's bread market.
</p><p>
Back in the day plenty of people would have lived in Bread Street ward, which was the birthplace of the poets John Donne and John Milton.  But the residential population here is now very low, and most of the electors in this by-election will be people who work in the ward and are nominated by businesses based here.
</p><p>
The ward is represented on the City Corporation by the Alderman and two Common Councilmen.  Since the last City elections in March 2022 one of the two Common Councilmen for Bread Street has been Emily Benn, Tony Benn's granddaughter.  Emily has served as a Labour councillor in Croydon in the past and has stood three times for Parliament as a Labour candidate, but elections in the City don't work like that; even politicians who are well-known for being partisan in other fields will normally seek election in the City as independent candidates, as Benn did.  This memo was seemingly not received by Harini Iyengar, who stood in Bread Street in 2022 as an official candidate of the Women's Equality Party and finished last out of four candidates.
</p><p>
Common Councilmen of the City serve for four-year terms.  Alderman of the City are technically elected for life; however, in practice there is a retirement age and an expectation that Aldermen will seek re-election at least every six years.  Sir William Russell was first elected in 2013, and previously sought re-election in August 2018: on that occasion, nobody opposed him (<em>Andrew's Previews 2018</em>, page 305).
</p><p>
Russell is now seeking re-election for a third term of office as Alderman.  This time he faces a bakeoff in Bread Street from Sarah Loveday, a chartered HR professional whose puntastic election slogan is "Knead for Change".  As normal, both candidates are Independent.  The City's electoral process started yesterday with the Wardmote, a public meeting-cum-hustings which has been adjourned for the poll, and which will reconvene tonight for the declaration of the result.

<h2>Golden Valley South</h2>
</p><p>
Herefordshire council; caused by the death of independent councillor Peter Jinman.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/herefs-golden-valley-s-2023.png" alt="Herefs, Golden Valley S" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
From central London we now travel to that consistently beautiful area, the Welsh Marches.  A ward name like "Golden Valley South" certainly promises a lot of beauty, but in this case that's a happy coincidence: the river which runs through the Golden Valley is the Dore, which the Normans confused with the French "<em>d'or</em>", giving a literal valley of gold.
</p><p>
The Normans left the ward Dore Abbey, a Cistercian foundation which is now the parish church for the village of Abbey Dore.  We also have the tiny parish of Turnastone, which derives its name from the 12th-century landowner Ralph of Tournai; and the Normans also had a castle at Ewyas Harold, the Harold here being a grandson of King Ethelred the Unready and son of the 1050s Earl of Hereford Ralph the Timid.  Now there's a name which leaves you wanting to know more.  All these castles reflect the fact that this is frontierland: the western boundary of Golden Valley South is also the boundary between England and Wales, with the 2,220-foot summit of Hay Bluff overlooking the Golden Valley from the border.
</p><p>
By acreage, Golden Valley South is the largest ward in the sparsely-populated county of Herefordshire, and the economy of this remote area is dominated by hill-farming.  This propels the ward to a number of the top 100 ward lists for England and Wales: it ranks 7th for self-employment (23.9%, the highest figure for any ward in the West Midlands), in the top 50 for skilled trades occupations (24.4%) and in the top 60 for those employed in agriculture, forestry or fishing (14.9%).  Golden Valley South also sneaks into the top 100 wards in England and Wales for detached housing (72.3%).
</p><p>
Herefordshire council has been a bit of a mess in recent local elections.  An unpopular Conservative administration crashed and burned here in 2019, with independent councillors together with the localist group "It's Our County" becoming the largest bloc on the council.  In May 2023 the pendulum swung the other way: the Conservatives gained seats against the national trend to finish with 21 councillors against 12 Lib Dems, 9 Greens, 8 independents, 2 It's Our County and 1 Labour.  That adds up to another hung council, but the Conservatives have secured the support of enough independent councillors to take minority control of Herefordshire.  The Conservatives also represent this area in Parliament; Jesse Norman, a junior transport minister, has been the MP for Hereford and South Herefordshire since 2010.
</p><p>
Now remember that I said Golden Valley South ward's economy is dominated by hill-farming.  Well, that makes it very appropriate that the councillor here since a 2017 by-election (<em>Andrew's Previews 2017</em>, page 240) had been prominent Ewyas Harold vet Peter Jinman, who was appointed OBE in 2004 for services to the veterinary profession and chaired DEFRA's Farm Animal Welfare Committee for ten years.  He had served a year as chairman of both the British Veterinary Association and the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, and was well-enough known on the national stage that the <em>Guardian</em> published an obituary for him (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/jul/16/peter-jinman-obituary">link</a>).  Jinman had won a second term of office very easily in 2019, and secured a third term on 4th May 2023 with a 52-35 lead over the Conservatives.  He had stood for re-election despite a cancer diagnosis, on the basis that his doctors had given him a good prognosis; unfortunately, this proved not to be the case and Jinman passed away three weeks into his third term of office.  He was 72 years old.
</p><p>
Two independent candidates have come forward to succeed Peter Jinman.  Mike Jones is a former independent Herefordshire councillor, who represented Weobley ward from 2019 until losing his seat in May; Toby Murcott is a schoolteacher, local resident and Abbey Dore parish councillor.  The Conservatives have reselected Dave Greenow, a farmer who was previously a Herefordshire Conservative councillor from 2011 to 2019.  Also standing are Cat Hornsey for the Lib Dems and Sandy Grenar for Labour.

<h2>Worfield</h2>
</p><p>
Shropshire council; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Richard Marshall.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/shropshire-worfield.png" alt="Shropshire, Worfield" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Our remaining polls today are in the western part of England, starting with a very rural area in the West Midlands.  The Worfield electoral division covers a series of tiny villages on the east bank of the River Severn, roughly the area between the edge of Bridgnorth to the south-west, the edge of Telford to the north-west and the Staffordshire border to the south-east.  Most of the main road links to Bridgnorth - north from Telford, east from Wolverhampton or south-east from Stourbridge - pass through this division, and there are certainly plenty of vehicles around to use them: Worfield makes the top 70 wards in England and Wales for households with three or more cars or vans, and the top jobs of Wolverhampton and Telford are certainly within commuting distance.
</p><p>
The largest of the eight parishes in the division is Worfield itself, although its headcount is inflated by the fact that Worfield is a geographically large parish whose boundaries include a number of other settlements.  One of those hamlets is Stableford further up the Worfe valley, where Henry and Eleanor Wodehouse and their family lived from 1896 to 1902 after Henry retired from the Hong Kong civil service; their teenage son P G Wodehouse later used the area as a rather thinly disguised setting for some of his novels.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/shropshire21.png" alt="Shropshire, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
This is a true-blue corner of Shropshire both in parliamentary and local elections.  At Westminster level it's part of the Ludlow constituency, which is to be renamed as South Shropshire at the next general election at which point the local MP Philip Dunne will retire.  All four local elections in Worfield since the current Shropshire council was introduced in 2009 have been very heavy wins for the Conservatives: the division last went to the polls in 2021, when the new Conservative candidate Richard Marshall polled 75% of the vote against Lib Dem and Green opposition.  Shropshire council has a Conservative majority and Councillor Marshall quickly joined the council's cabinet, with responsibility for highways and regulatory reform; but he stood down from the council for personal reasons in July 2023, slightly more than half-way through his first term of office.
</p><p>
Defending for the Conservatives is Michael Wood, who is seeking to resume a long local government career.  Wood was first elected to the former Shropshire County Council as long ago as 1993, and he represented this Shropshire council division from 2009 until he handed the baton over to Marshall in 2021.  He is opposed by Andrew Sherrington for the Lib Dems and Shanthi Flynn for Labour.  The local radio station Sunshine Radio have interviewed all the candidates, and you can find out more here (<a href="https://www.sunshineradio.co.uk/ludlow/news/local-news/former-councillor-bidding-to-make-a-comeback-in-by-election/">link</a>).
</p><p>
Outgoing Shropshire councillor Richard Marshall is not to be confused with the Richard Marshall who for many years has been the solo cornet player with the Black Dyke brass band - a position which is similar in status and musical workload to the leader of a world-class symphony orchestra.  But if we fail to confuse the two Marshalls, we'll miss out on some great music.  So here is cornet player Richard Marshall in a live performance from 2016, showing just why he's held that position with Dyke for so long.

<h2>Audley; and<br>
Knutton</h2>
</p><p>
Newcastle-under-Lyme council, Staffordshire; caused respectively by the resignations of Labour councillors Sue Moffat and Steph Talbot.
</p><p>
Our tour through the western counties of England continues in Staffordshire, as we come to two wards on the edge of the Potteries conurbation.  Very much so in the case of Audley, which is the centre of a large rural parish to the north-west of Newcastle-under-Lyme; this is one of the wards where many pass through but few linger, because the M6 motorway and the A500 dual carriageway to the Potteries both run through the ward.
</p><p>

</p><p>
Audley Rural parish contains a number of other villages which used to have coal pits, including Bignall End which in January 1918 was the scene of the North Staffordshire coalfield's worst mining disaster.  An explosion of firedamp inside the Minnie Pit killed 156 men and boys; the source of the initial spark was never identified.  The news came to the attention of the war poet Wilfred Owen, who wrote a poem about the disaster shortly afterwards; <em>Miners</em> was one of the few poems by Owen published in his lifetime.
</p><p>
<blockquote>
Comforted years will sit soft-chaired,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In rooms of amber;<br>
The years will stretch their hands, well-cheered<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By our life's ember;
</p><p>
The centuries will burn rich loads<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With which we groaned,<br>
Whose warmth shall lull their dreaming lids,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While songs are crooned;<br>
But they will not dream of us poor lads,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Left in the ground.

</p><p>
Mining for coal in this area ceased long ago, but the brickmaking company Ibstock continues to operate a quarry just to the west of Knutton, a working-class village not far west of Newcastle town centre.  This quarry lies outside Knutton ward, as does the landfill site of Walleys Quarry which is the site of one of the most pungent ongoing political controversies.  And when I say pungent, I mean pungent: the place stinks, and it has stunk Newcastle borough out for years with high levels of hydrogen sulphide emissions.
</p><p>
This column previously covered Walleys Quarry in November 2021 (<em>Andrew's Previews 2021</em>, page 510), in the wake of a High Court ruling that the Environment Agency's enforcement action against the quarry's operator had been inadequate.  The Environment Agency had appealed against that decision, and their appeal was upheld by the Court of Appeal which overturned the High Court's ruling in December 2021.  In the two years which have passed since then the smell has not stopped, and the Environment Agency still receives complaints from local residents on a very frequent basis.  Waste dumping in Walleys Quarry is expected to continue until 2026, by which time the landfill site will be full.
</p><p>
It's fair to say that the Walleys Quarry operators don't have a good relationship either with the Environment Agency or the local MP.  Conservative backbencher Aaron Bell, a prominent quizzer who won series championships on <em>The Krypton Factor</em> and <em>Only Connect</em> before entering politics, has previously made allegations about the quarry's working practices under parliamentary privilege.  He gained the Newcastle-under-Lyme parliamentary seat, which covers both Audley and Knutton wards, from Labour in December 2019.
</p><p>
That gives the Tories a trifecta in this corner of Staffordshire, as they also have majorities on both Staffordshire county council and Newcastle-under-Lyme council.  It perhaps helps that neither of those authorities had elections in 2023, which was not a good Tory year in Staffordshire; Newcastle council has an unusual electoral cycle and its last elections were in May 2022.  The Conservatives had taken control of a hung council through defections in the 2018-22 term, and the 2022 borough elections saw this confirmed by the voters: Newcastle council returned 25 Conservative councillors against 19 for Labour.
</p><p>
The two previous results for Audley ward show those factors in action.  In 2018 Audley's three seats had split between an independent, Labour and the Liberal Democrats; in 2022 the Labour councillor Sue Moffat was re-elected, the former Lib Dem councillor Ian Wilkes was re-elected as a Conservative, and the Conservatives gained the seat left open by the retirement of the independent councillor.  Shares of the vote were 49% for Labour and 38% for the Conservatives, but because the Labour figure was inflated by Moffat's personal vote the seat count was 2-1 in the Conservatives' favour.  Conservative councillor Wilkes had previously gained the local county council seat of Audley and Chesterton from Labour in 2021.
</p><p>
Knutton ward's election results are complicated by what is clearly a very large personal vote for the local Conservative county councillor Derrick Huckfield, who has sought election here over the last 21 years successively for the "Caring Party", UKIP and the Conservatives and has won under the latter two labels.  Labour candidates who have lost to Huckfield in the past include Gareth Snell, who went on to have a brief career as MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central, and Llin Golding who had been the Labour MP for Newcastle-under-Lyme from 1986 to 2001.  In 2018 Huckfield sought re-election to Newcastle council as a Conservative in the neighbouring Silverdale ward, and lost; Labour won Knutton by a 75-25 margin over the Conservatives.  The Labour councillor for Knutton, Brian Johnson, resigned in 2021.  For the resulting by-election on 25th November, I wrote:
</p><p>
<blockquote>
This by-election is a straight fight.  Defending for Labour is Steph Talbot, who stood in May's county council elections for Newcastle South division; she runs Alice, a charity supporting disadvantaged and vulnerable families in Newcastle and Stoke.  Challenging for the Conservatives is county councillor Derrick Huckfield.  <b>Despite the 3 to 1 margin in favour of Labour three years ago, this column would rate Huckfield as favourite.</b>
</blockquote>
</p><p>
Note those words emphasised here.  This column almost never makes explicit predictions of who's going to win an election in the preview, so that last sentence - an explicit prediction that the Conservatives would overturn a Labour majority of almost 50 percentage points - put my reputation on the line.  And I was right.  When the votes came out of the single ballot box (Knutton ward only has one polling station), Derrick Huckfield defeated Steph Talbot by 188 votes to 180.
</p><p>
But Huckfield's triumph proved to be short-lived on that occasion.  The 2022 Newcastle council elections six months later saw a rematch in Knutton ward between Huckfield and Talbot, and this time Steph Talbot ran out the winner by 48% to 34%.
</p><p>
So, we have here a three-councillor ward whose representation is split between Labour and the Conservatives, and a single-member ward which has voted for both parties within the last two years. And Labour are defending both of these wards in by-elections, following the resignations of their councillors Sue Moffat and Steph Talbot.  I have not been able to find any given reason for their resignations, but in the case of Moffat it is noticeable that she recently applied to be Labour's next parliamentary candidate for Newcastle-under-Lyme and didn't get the selection; while last December Talbot was ousted as the head of the Alice charity.
</p><p>
Defending the Labour seat in Audley ward is Rebekah Lewis, a local mum who works as a community adviser for a local charity.  The Conservatives, who will have a full slate in this ward if they gain this by-election, have selected Sally Rudd who is a dental therapist from Bignall End.  Also standing are Andrew Wemyss for the Liberal Democrats and independent candidate Duran O'Dwyer, who also both give addresses in the ward.
</p><p>
In Knutton ward the defending Labour candidate is Robert Moss, who has recently retired from a 28-year career as a firefighter.  Challenging for the Conservatives is county councillor Derrick Huckfield.  This by-election is not a straight fight, thanks to the intervention of Lib Dem Aidan Jenkins.  And there will be no prediction this time, because I am a coward!

<h2>Brooklands</h2>
</p><p>
Manchester council; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Julia Baker-Smith.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/manchester-brooklands.png" alt="Manchester, Brooklands" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Let's finish for the week with a very different ward, within the urban sprawl of Manchester.  But this hasn't always been the case.  A century ago Brooklands ward was Cheshire parkland, with the Tudor stately home of Wythenshawe Hall at its centre.  Wythenshawe Hall had been home for centuries to the Tatton family, and the land around it was a deer park on the south bank of the River Mersey.  The hall had been knocked around by the English Civil War, when it was besieged for three months in the winter of 1643-44 before falling to the Parliamentarians, but was then patched up.
</p><p>
Quite the contrast with the far side, the Lancashire side, of the Mersey: there lay Didsbury, a suburb of the crowded, industrial city of Manchester.  Didsbury was and remains an attractive suburb for the middle classes, but in 1923 inner-city Manchester had a lot of substandard slum terraces which needed something doing to them for reasons of public health.  But what to do with all the people living there?
</p><p>
In 1926 Wythenshawe Hall and its surrounding grounds were bought from the Tattons by Ernest Simon, a Liberal politician who had been Lord Mayor of Manchester in 1921-22 - at the time the city's youngest-ever Lord Mayor - and served as Liberal MP for Manchester Withington in the short-lived 1922-23 Parliament.  Simon was also one of the founding subscribers of the <em>New Statesman</em>, contributing £1,000 of the money needed to get that periodical going in 1913.  He saw Wythenshawe as the answer to Manchester's housing problems, and he immediately donated the Hall and its grounds to Manchester Corporation to be used solely for the public good.  The land is now the open space of Wythenshawe Park; the hall became a museum.
</p><p>
Wythenshawe Hall was badly damaged in an arson attack in 2016; following restoration, it reopened to the public a year ago.  That arson attack happened under the gaze of an 1875 statue of a previous person who had tried to trash the place, Oliver Cromwell.  His statue was relocated here from the city centre in 1868.
</p><p>
Later in 1926 the last male head of the Tatton family finally gave in and sold the rest of Wythenshawe to Manchester Corporation, who over the last century have filled it with council houses.  The "garden suburb" of Wythenshawe is a claimant for the title of Europe's largest council estate, and the five wards of Manchester city council which cover it today had a combined population of 79,000 in the 2021 census.  Anywhere else in the country this would be a major town; but Wythenshawe has never even had town status, instead being just a Manchester suburb.
</p><p>
Brooklands is the north-western of Wythenshawe's five wards, covering Wythenshawe Park, Northern Moor, a large chunk of Baguley and the Southmoor industrial estate.  It's served by the Northern Moor, Wythenshawe Park, Moor Road and Baguley tram stops on the Wythenshawe/Airport branch of the Metrolink tram system.  This tram line opened only in 2014; before then Wythenshawe was very poorly connected to the outside world, with no railway station and with the motorway network having to take much of the strain.
</p><p>
Wythenshawe's founder Ernest Simon had a part to play in one of the UK's most obscure political records.  After losing his Manchester Withington seat in the Commons in 1923 he got it back in 1929, lost re-election in 1931 and made a number of later attempts to get back onto the green benches, finishing up as an independent candidate in the Combined English Universities by-election of March 1946.  This by-election had four strong candidates.  Simon's 22% of the vote was good enough for third place, over independent Labour candidate Stanley Wormald's 19% (this was the last parliamentary by-election of the 20th century in Great Britain which Labour did not contest).  Second place in the 1946 Combined English Universities by-election went to the writer, suffragist, future radio broadcaster and independent candidate Mary Stocks with 28%, while the Conservative candidate, past and future Norwich MP Henry Strauss, won with a hair under 30% of the vote.  This still stands as the record low winning score in a parliamentary by-election; but records are there to be broken, and a recent constituency poll for the forthcoming Mid Bedfordshire by-election suggests that Strauss' 1946 record might be in some danger.
</p><p>
This is the second by-election which Andrew's Previews has covered resulting from the resignation of councillor Julia Baker-Smith.  She had been a Manchester councillor since 2021 but started her local government career in 2013 on the Isle of Wight, being elected as an independent councillor for Whippingham and Osborne ward under her previous surname of Hill.  Baker-Smtih was re-elected there in 2017, and served as leader of an independent group on the Isle of Wight council before joining the Labour party and relocating to Manchester.  She resigned from that council in 2019, and the resulting Whippingham and Osborne by-election (<em>Andrew's Previews 2019</em>, page 186) was gained by the Conservatives.
</p><p>
Might the same happen here?  Well, like the rest of the city of Manchester, Brooklands ward is a Labour stronghold; Labour hold 87 of the 96 seats on the city council plus this vacancy, and in May this ward turned in a Labour lead of 70-13 over the Conservatives.  The Tories have been shut out of Manchester city council since the 1990s, and their efforts to get back on the council in the 2000s were focused on this ward: that choice seems to have been based less on Manchester Brooklands' demographic than on the fact that the ward borders strongly middle-class wards in Sale and Timperley, which were Conservative strongholds on Trafford council back in those days.  The Conservatives came close to gaining this ward at the Labour low point of 2008; but the Trafford Tories have other things to worry about now, and the 13% Conservative score in Manchester Brooklands ward in May suggests that outside support for the party's Manchester branch has dried up.  Labour also represent this ward in parliament: junior frontbencher Mike Kane has been the MP for Wythenshawe and Sale East since winning a by-election in 2014, and his seat has been left unchanged by the Boundary Commission going forward.
</p><p>
Outgoing councillor Baker-Smith doesn't appear to have completely left her Isle of Wight roots.  She was working remotely in an NHS job which is nominally based there, and she quit Manchester council in July to spend more time on the island caring for a family member.
</p><p>
Defending the resulting Brooklands by-election for Labour is Dave Marsh, who describes himself on Twitter as a born and bred Wythenshawe lad.  The Conservatives are hoping for a decent result with their candidate Norman Decent who, like Baker-Smith, has experience of local government on the south coast: he was a Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole councillor representing Kinson ward in Bournemouth from 2019 to May 2023, and his second-place finish in Manchester Brooklands ward in 2022 came while he was still a serving BCP councillor.  Also standing are two returning candidates from May 2023, the Greens' Grace Buczkowska and Reform UK's Dylan Evans; they complete the ballot paper along with Euan Stewart for the Lib Dems.
