<!-- Andrew's previews continue to be historical and electoral tours de force. - Lord Hayward -->
<blockquote>
"All the right votes, but not necessarily in the right order"
</blockquote>
</p><p>
Three by-elections on 21st December 2023:
</p><p>
<h2>Blaby and Glen Parva</h2>
</p><p>
Leicestershire county council; and
</p><p>
<h2>Glen Parva</h2>
</p><p>
Blaby council, Leicestershire; both caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Geoff Welsh.
</p><p>
One of the most prominent British frontline politicians to have left us in 2023 was Nigel Lawson, who passed away in April at the age of 91.  Lawson served for over six years as Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Thatcher years, presiding over tax cuts, deregulation of the City's financial markets and a namesake economic boom, while also bringing the government budget into surplus.  In later life he was a key supporter of Brexit, while also making occasional appearances in the cookery programmes presented by his daughter Nigella.  Nigel leaves behind five surviving children, including Nigella and the journalist Dominic Lawson, who once served as editor of the <em>Spectator</em> - following in the footsteps of his father.
</p><p>
Upon his translation to the Lords in 1992, Nigel Lawson took the title of Lord Lawson of Blaby - the second part coming from the name of the constituency which he represented from 1974 to 1992.  The name "Blaby" has now disappeared from our constituency map, and it was always a rather obscure place to have a seat named after it.
</p><p>

</p><p>
In fact, Blaby doesn't even count as a town. It's a large village about five miles to the south of Leicester, located just outside Leicester's built-up area from which it is separated by the Leicester-Nuneaton railway line, the River Sence and the Grand Union Canal.  Blaby parish has a population of a little over 6,000; there are other Leicester satellite towns in the area which are larger these days.
</p><p>
Despite this, Blaby has been an administrative centre in this corner of Leicestershire for a very long time.  In the nineteenth century there was a Blaby Poor Law Union, which turned into Blaby Rural District in 1894, which turned into the current Blaby local government district in 1974.  Also in 1974 a Blaby parliamentary seat was created, with Nigel Lawson becoming its first MP.
</p><p>
The parliamentary seat was renamed as "South Leicestershire" in 2010, on the grounds that nobody knew where Blaby was.  Since 2015 the MP here has been Conservative backbencher Alberto Costa, who has a safe seat which the Boundary Commission have made only minor changes to.
</p><p>
Blaby council itself has been under Conservative control for all but six of the last 49 years.  The Tories currently have 19 out of 36 seats, a majority of two which is not at stake today; the opposition is split fairly evenly between eight Lib Dems plus this vacancy, six Labour councillors and two Greens.  The district's Labour vote is concentrated in Braunstone, which is one of a number of areas in Blaby district which are to all intents and purposes part of Leicester but have never been incorporated into the city.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/blaby-glen-parva.png" alt="Blaby, Glen Parva" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Which brings us to Glen Parva, an extension of the Leicester built-up area which lies immediately to the north of Blaby.  Glen Parva ward and parish has had a large bite taken out of it by the expansion of Leicester; Leicester city council filled that area in the 1940s and 1950s with the Eyres Monsell council estate, named after the Conservative MP Bolton Eyres-Monsell who had previously owned the land.  That left the parish with a curious shape, covering a rather more upmarket housing area to the west of the Eyres Monsell estate, the village of Glen Parva itself to the south, and a salient north of Glen Parva which is cut off from the rest of the parish by the railway line.  There is a good reason for this: it's a secure area, which was once occupied by Glen Parva Barracks (home of the Royal Leicestershire Regiment from 1873 to 1964) and is now home to HMP Fosse Way, a low-security Category C prison which opened in May this year.
</p><p>
Also in May this year we had the latest elections to Blaby council, which took place on a new ward map that created Glen Parva ward, with the same boundaries as the parish.  This was previously two-thirds of Saxondale ward, which also took in northern parts of Blaby and was a safe ward for the Liberal Democrats.  Glen Parva has continued in that vein: in May 2023 it returned the Lib Dem slate with a 56-23 lead over the Conservatives.  Perhaps it helps that Glen Parva merges seamlessly to the east into South Wigston, which is part of the long-standing Lib Dem district of Oadby and Wigston.
</p><p>
Top of the poll here in May was veteran Lib Dem councillor Geoff Welsh, who according to his LinkedIn account had been a Blaby councillor here since July 1992 - I have been unable to trace that by-election, but have no reason to doubt his claim.  Welsh had also been the Leicestershire county councillor for Blaby and Glen Parva since 2013, being re-elected for a third term in 2021 with a 49-34 lead over the Conservatives.  He stepped down from both his council roles in November on health grounds, and there has just been time to organise a by-election before Christmas.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/leics21.png" alt="Leics CC, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Defending the county council seat of Blaby and Glen Parva for the Liberal Democrats is Sue Jordan, who is a Blaby parish councillor; in May she was an unsuccessful candidate for the district council, contesting Leicester Forest and Lubbesthorpe ward.  The Conservative candidate is Blaby district councillor Nigel Grundy, who sits for Narborough and Littlethorpe ward and is the district council's cabinet member for neighbourhood services and assets.  Also standing are Laura Badland for Labour and Mike Jelfs for the Green Party.
</p><p>
The defending Lib Dem candidate in the Glen Parva by-election for the district council is Ande Savage, who is a Glen Parva parish councillor.  He works as a numeracy peer mentor and also volunteers for Foxes Pride, which led to allegations of homophobia when a recent application by him to be co-opted to Blaby parish council was rejected.  Standing here for the Conservatives is Shane Blackwell, who is a business process manager for the UK's largest builder's merchant; he is hoping to get back onto the district council after losing his seat in Countesthorpe ward in May.  Labour's Laura Badland and the Greens' Mike Jelfs do double duty in both the county and district by-elections; neither of their parties contested Glen Parva ward last time.
</p><p>
That completes all the electoral events on the British mainland for 2023; but there is one poll still left to bring you.  We're now going to go walking in the air over the sea, for our Christmas Bonus...

<h2>Ventnor and St Lawrence</h2>
</p><p>
Isle of Wight council; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Gary Peace.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/iow-ventnor-st-lawrence.png" alt="IOW, Ventnor/St Lawrence" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Welcome to the English Mediterranean, Mayfair by the Sea.  Here on the southern coast of the Isle of Wight we find the Undercliff area where the weather is relatively warm all year round, with steep slopes facing the English Channel to the south and with downland protecting the area from cold northerly winds.  In 1830, when tuberculosis was a major killer in the UK, a physician called James Clark wrote a book called <em>The Influence of Climate on Disease</em> which singled out the Undercliff as a place ideal for people with chest complaints to live and recuperate.
</p><p>
Thus was born the town of Ventnor, built on those steep slopes facing the Channel as a resort for good weather and good health.  By 1888 there were regular steamers to the town's pier from nearby ports on the south coast of Great Britain, and the local railway company ran an "Invalid Express" non-stop from Ryde Pier for the benefit of passengers with TB.  In the 1901 census Ventnor parish had a population over 6,000 - larger than today's figure.
</p><p>
But Ventnor has suffered the usual decline of the UK seaside resort, as medical change - modern effective treatments and vaccinations for TB - combined with social change, with the British holidaymaker deciding that the English Mediterranean was inferior to the actual Mediterranean.  The fact that those steep slopes are prone to house-destroying landslips doesn't help matters for the locals.  One recent landslip at nearby Bonchurch, which obliterated the local beauty spot known as the Devil's Chimney, has taken out the main road towards Shanklin until at least January.
</p><p>
But the town still has a nice climate even in this cold season, as we can see from the presence of the Ventnor Botanic Garden whose collection of palm trees has national significance.  And the census shows that holidaymakers are still a bedrock of the local economy: in the 2021 census Ventnor and St Lawrence ward had the fourth-highest proportion of people working in accommodation or food service of any ward in the South East.  (The three wards above it are also on the Wight coast, with the two Shanklin wards coming in at numbers 1 and 2.)
</p><p>
The Isle of Wight has formed a single parliamentary seat since 1885, and for much of that time it has been the UK's largest parliamentary seat by headcount.  Its electorate is in the annoying range of too big for one MP but not quite big enough for two.  You could get the numbers to work by drawing a cross-Solent constituency containing parts of the island and parts of the mainland, but nobody has ever thought that would be a good idea; so Wight has remained throughout successive boundary reviews as a single, uncomfortably oversized seat.
</p><p>
Until the most recent boundary review, which had new limits on the maximum and minimum size of constituencies.  Because nobody thought that a cross-Solent constituency would be a good idea, that meant that the island needed to be treated as a special case.  So for the next general election the Boundary Commission have split Wight into two constituencies whose electorates, at around 55,000 each, will be the smallest of any seat in England.  Ventnor will be included in the new seat of Isle of Wight East, which is based on the resort towns covering the island's east coast.  The current Tory MP for Wight Bob Seely is seeking re-election in Isle of Wight West, so Ventnor will have a new MP fairly soon.
</p><p>
The Isle of Wight council has alternated in recent years between Conservative and independent control.  The most recent local elections were in 2021 and saw independents take control, against the national trend of a good Conservative year: the Tories were still the largest party with 18 out of 39 seats, but they were now in a minority against 13 independents, 2 Greens, 1 councillor each for Labour and the Lib Dems and four seats for localist parties: two for the Island Independent Network and one each for Our Island and the Vectis Party.  A coalition of the most of the independent councillors plus the Island Independent Network, the Greens and the Our Island councillor is now running the show.
</p><p>
All three localist parties contested the newly-drawn Ventnor and St Lawrence ward in 2021, leading to a rather fragmented result.  Gary Peace, the outgoing Conservative councillor for the predecessor ward of Ventnor West, was re-elected with just 27% of the vote.  The Vectis Party finished in second place with 21%, Labour were third on 20%, Our Island fourth on 15% and the Island Independent Network fifth on 14%.
</p><p>
There have two previous by-elections to Isle of Wight council since 2021, both of which were gained by the Liberal Democrats who didn't stand in Ventnor and St Lawrence last time.  Their most recent win, in August in Wootton Bridge division, followed the imprisonment of the Vectis Party's councillor and leader Daryll Pitcher for historic child rape offences.  The Vectis Party has now been wound up and neither of the other localist parties are standing in this by-election, so there are a lot of votes up for grabs here.  Expect vote share changes to be wild.
</p><p>
Christmas should be a time of peace and goodwill to all, so in these troubled times with war in Europe and the Middle East perhaps it's reflective of something that our final by-election of 2023 follows the resignation of Conservative councillor Gary Peace.  He was first elected in 2017 in the former Ventnor West division, gaining his seat from an independent, and had previously served on the council's cabinet with the digital transformation and community safety portfolio.  Peace's resignation in October was for personal reasons.
</p><p>
If the Conservatives can't improve on their 27% score in Ventnor and St Lawrence last time then they will lose this by-election, because this time there are only three candidates.  Their defending candidate is Ed Blake, a businessman who runs the Ventnor Haven Fishery and is chair of Ventnor rugby club.  Returning for Labour is their 2021 candidate Steve Cooper, who is the current mayor of Ventnor and is the only candidate to give an address in the division.  None of the localist parties from last time have returned, so our third candidate is Ray Harrington-Vail who founded and until recently ran a local educational charity, the Footprint Trust; he gives an address in Newport, and he has the Liberal Democrat nomination.

<h2>The same procedure as last year, Miss Sophie?</h2>
</p><p>

</p><p>
We still have ten days of this calendar year to go, but that is that for the electoral year of 2023 - the thirteenth year of Andrew's Previews.  As is traditional, I'll close down for the year with some personal notes and votes of thanks, as we toast the new year, bid farewell to the old, and wonder whether the change of year will herald an improvement.
</p><p>
Let's start by looking back at the last 12 months.  If we do this from a national polling point of view, the curious incident is that nothing has changed: every national opinion poll commissioned in 2023 has seen a Labour lead over the Conservatives of ten points or greater.  We've also had a Prime Minister who has kept their job throughout the year, which is quite the achievement these days.
</p><p>
The electoral cycle turns much more slowly than the 24-hour news cycle, so the results of real elections are still trying to catch up with that relatively recent change in the national mood.  Let's look at the seven Parliamentary Specials which Andrew's Previews wrote this year: in West Lancashire, Selby and Ainsty, Somerton and Frome, Uxbridge and South Ruislip, Rutherglen and Hamilton West, Mid Bedfordshire and Tamworth.  Of those seven by-elections, four resulted in gains for the Labour Party and one in a Liberal Democrat gain, with the governing Conservatives holding only one of the five seats they were defending.  None of the Labour gains were in marginal seats, and the two most recent (Mid Bedfordshire and Tamworth) set records for respectively the largest numerical and largest percentage majority ever overturned in a parliamentary by-election.
</p><p>
The ordinary local elections in May told the same story, with a bloodbath for the Conservatives in local government - a story which this column will continue to tell over the next three-and-a-bit years as we travel up and down the country.  And that was Tory losses against May 2019, which - being at the height of the Brexit wars - was not generally seen then as a good year for the party.
</p><p>
Local by-elections tell the same story.  Once today's three polls are over there will have been 163 local by-elections in 2023 across Great Britain; of the 160 results in so far, Labour have won 60 (a net gain of four), the Liberal Democrats 41 (a net gain of 23) and the Conservatives just 24 (a net loss of 24).  Plaid Cymru held the three seats they were defending.  The gross figures here aren't that important - this is not by any means a representative sample of areas - but the changes are more instructive.  The Tories held only 15 of the 48 seats they were defending - although that was a better performance than that of the Scottish National Party, which had six local by-elections to defend this year and lost the lot.  Humza Yousaf will have to wait until the new year to see the SNP win their first election during his tenure as First Minister.
</p><p>
Although there are no independent or localist candidates in this week's three polls, it's been a vintage year for those groups.  The local by-election score for candidates outside the main parties this year currently stands at 32 wins and a net gain of three.  It's extremely unusual for independents and localists to finish with a net gain across the year, because when independent candidates leave the stage there is often no independent successor to take up their torch.  Only one other year this century, 2013, has seen independents and parties outside the traditional big three finish in positive territory in local by-elections - and that statistic was driven by the rise of UKIP.  UKIP are now extinct in local government, and their successors Reform UK - with the exception of six seats where they piggybacked on the success of a Derby localist party - have drawn a complete blank this year in the relatively few local elections where they bothered to stand.
</p><p>
The next scheduled elections in England and Wales are on Thursday 2nd May 2024, when we will have polls for the Mayor and Assembly in London, the Police and Crime Commissioners in the rest of England and Wales and most of the regional mayors.  Between those categories, that means that everybody in England and Wales will have something to vote for in May 2024.
</p><p>
We will also have ordinary local elections in May 2024 in those English districts and boroughs which elect their councillors by thirds or halves.  These are for councillors who were last re-elected in May 2021, a notably good Conservative year where the party swept many of the traditional marginal towns.  For example, the Conservatives won seven out of twelve wards in Hartlepool; all nine wards up for election in Redditch; all ten wards in Tamworth; 12 out of 13 in Cannock Chase.  All of these are boroughs which have since swung to Labour, hard.  If the Conservatives can't improve on their 2023 performance, then at the next local elections in five months' time they are facing massive losses: not just in those boroughs, but also in other places like them.
</p><p>
That's if our local councils get that far.  2024 marks the fiftieth anniversary of England's current local government structure, which in some counties remains unmodified from Edward Heath's big bang reorganisation of 1974.  But the last decade or more of austerity in local government finance has not been an edifying sight.  Councils run around in ever-decreasing circles around Miss Sophie's birthday party table trying to balance their budgets and serve their residents and guests; and they have become more and more disoriented in the process.  There are only so many times you can walk into the tiger's head on the floor before you fall over it and crash to the ground.
</p><p>
With nothing remaining to cut, an increasing number of councils are now declaring effective bankruptcy to the detriment of their residents.  Even newly-formed councils like Somerset - created partially in a bid to cut costs by excising an entire layer of local democracy - are staring into the financial abyss.  To some extent we get the local democracy and local government that we're prepared to pay for, but a responsible Westminster government would recognise that the services our councils are expected to provide need to be funded.  That probably means tax rises - and while nobody likes the way that council tax goes up every year, we should remember that the pace of inflation means that council tax last year - and probably next year - has not in fact kept up with increases in the cost of living.
</p><p>
Which flavour of responsible Westminster government we end up with will be decided by the next Westminster general election, which can reasonably be expected in the next year.  This column has long been of the opinion that 2nd May - the ordinary local elections day - is the most likely date.  So, if I write next year's annual review in December 2024 in the middle of a general election campaign, you'll know whose face to throw the eggs of failure at.
</p><p>
That general election will be administered, as usual, by our local council staff.  Our first annual vote of thanks should go to them.  They don't just come out at election time: they work hard for you all year round.  Thank you to all our electoral services staff and to all the other people who help out at election time to keep our democracy going.  We couldn't run this country without you.  Have a well-earned Christmas break, and I hope you'll be back in the new year refreshed and ready for what's likely to be a busy 12 months.
</p><p>
Our second toast is to those people who take part in our elections.  This column has mentioned hundreds of candidates over the last twelve months, and between them they have attracted hundreds of thousands of votes.  Without you - whether you're a candidate or a voter - I'd have nothing to talk about.  If you're an election candidate in the coming year and you think that I've unfairly written off your chances, go out on the campaign trail and prove me wrong - that will be far more satisfying for both of us than moaning and whinging.  If you're an elector, I hope I'll enlighten you as to your choice - and do please remember to go down to the polling station with your photo ID in hand.
</p><p>
This week brought us news that yet another MP Behaving Badly had been ejected from the Commons, with a successful recall petition against Peter Bone creating a vacancy in the Wellingborough constituency.  It'll be well into the New Year before a poll could be held there, and there might not have time for another Parliamentary Special before the Prime Minister goes to the country.
</p><p>
If so, that will give me some time to edit for publication the eighth annual collection of these columns, <em>Andrew's Previews 2023</em>.  It'll be ready when it's ready.  In the meantime, the seven earlier paperback volumes in their fetching teal covers - "historical and electoral tours de force", said the Conservative polling guru Lord Hayward - are and will remain available from Amazon at your convenience.  The royalties from the books will go towards future Previews.

</p><p>
The <a href="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/leap/">Local Elections Archive Project</a> is now in its 21st year and continues to go from strength to strength as one of the largest online repositories of UK local election results.  At the time of writing the LEAP database has details of 370,992 candidacies in 79,904 wards, with details going back to May 2002 and complete coverage up to May 2019.  Yes, I know this sort of collection really should be a function of government, but let's finance our councils properly before we start spending public money on that sort of archiving.
</p><p>
Finally, continued thanks are due to our wonderful hosts at Britain Elects for not sacking me and still giving this column a home.  Councillor Ben Walker, the head honcho here, has put a lot of his experience and data into <a href="https://sotn.newstatesman.com/"><em>State of the Nation</em></a>, a website published under the auspices of the <em>New Statesman</em>, and his prediction models for the next general election still seem to be holding up pretty well.  Of course, their ultimate test is yet to come.  Why do I say <em>Councillor</em> Walker?  Well, that's because Ben was elected to Cheshire West and Chester council in May, so if you see somebody wandering around Chester city centre with Labour leaflets in his hand that might well be him.
</p><p>
All of the team at Britain Elects have a busy year ahead of us with a large set of local elections in England and Wales plus a Westminster election, but we stand ready, yet again, to go through the same procedure as every year.
</p><p>
<blockquote>
"The same procedure as last year, Miss Sophie?"<br>
"The same procedure as every year, James!"
</blockquote>
</p><p>
Well, I shall do my very best.  Before then, to play us out for the year as usual here's some music from Foden's Band, the British Open champions and the number 1 ranked brass band in the world.  This year I'll highlight their soprano cornet player Richard Poole - or, as the kids at my local secondary school call him, "Mr Poole" - with a seasonally appropriate recording of him as a soloist.  This is the main theme from the very schmaltzy 1978 film <em>Ice Castles</em>, Marvin Hamlisch's song <em>Through the Eyes of Love</em>.  <em>Ice Castles</em> is a film about the notably cold sport of figure skating, but if you're struggling to keep away from the cold this winter, this performance should warm you from the inside out.

</p><p>
There's only one thing left for Andrew's Previews to do now, and that is to close down for the year in the form of words which has become traditional.  This column will return in time for the first local by-elections of 2024, to be held in Salford, Weymouth, Clacton and Hove Actually on Thursday 11th January; until then, on behalf of all at Britain Elects may I wish you a very merry Christmas, and may your 2024 be an improvement on your 2023.
