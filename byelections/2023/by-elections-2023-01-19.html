Three by-elections on 19th January 2013 for four seats:

<h2>Biddulph North</h2>

Staffordshire county council; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Ian Lawson; and

<h2>Biddulph West</h2>

Staffordshire Moorlands council; a double by-election caused by the deaths of Lawson and independent councillor Hilda Sheldon.

Three of the four council seats up for election today are in Biddulph.  This is a Staffordshire town in the Pennines to the north of Stoke-on-Trent, located in a deep valley between Biddulph Moor to the east and Mow Cop to the west.

Mow Cop effectively marks the western edge of the Pennine high ground, and in good weather it is a fantastic viewpoint for the Cheshire plain with views extending as far as Snowdon.  The Cheshire/Staffordshire boundary runs along the crest of a ridge which extends north-east from Mow Cop and divides Biddulph from the Cheshire town of Congleton.

The town of Biddulph, which lies below and to the east of Mow Cop, advertises itself as the Garden Town of Staffordshire.  This isn't the time of year when gardens at at their best, but in better weather the National Trust property of Biddulph Grange is worth a visit.  The Victorian mansion of that name was once home to James Bateman, who had a huge passion for horticulture and laid out a notable garden on his estate with all sorts of different themes - Egyptian here, Chinese there, and so on.

The Biddulph North division of Staffordshire county council takes in the Wast and North wards of the town plus the village of Biddulph Moor to the east.  This lies on high ground, through which runs the main watershed of Great Britain.  Biddulph's valley drains to the north, with Biddulph Brook flowing into the River Dane at Congleton and thence to the Mersey estuary via the River Weaver.  Biddulph Moor, on the other hand, is notable as the source of the UK's third-longest river: the Trent, which drains south through Stoke on a lazy course towards the Humber estuary and the North Sea.

In 2011 Biddulph Moor ward's British-born population (98.8%) was the highest proportion of any ward in the West Midlands and in the top 15 wards in England and Wales; it also made the top 50 wards in England and Wales for its White British population (98.6%).  Biddulph North ward (centred on Biddulph Grange) was in the top 40 wards in England and Wales for owner-occupation (92.7% of households) and in the top 100 for White British population (98.4%).  Biddulph West ward (which includes the town centre) was in the top 90 wards for residents born in the UK (98.4%).  I'm still using 2011 census figures here because as far as I'm aware we don't yet have figures by ward from the 2021 census, but this is clearly a corner of the country which immigration has passed by.

The Biddulph North county division had been held by Ian Lawson of the Conservatives since he gained the seat from Labour in 2009.  He had turned it into a fairly safe seat, and he was re-elected for a fourth term of office in 2021 with a 58-36 lead over Labour.

Since 2009 the Conservatives have enjoyed a large majority on Staffordshire county council, but Staffordshire Moorlands district council has been a different matter.  This has been under Conservative leadership since 2007, but the party hasn't had a majority for all of that period.  Staffordshire Moorlands is an area which tends to elect a lot of independent councillors, and the 2019 elections here returned 25 Conservatives, 17 independents, 13 Labour councillors and a Lib Dem.  Since 2019 there have been three by-elections in the town of Cheadle, all of which resulted in the Conservatives gaining independent seats; that plus some defections mean that the Conservative group now has the 29 seats it needs for a majority, notwithstanding Ian Lawson's death.

The Staffordshire Moorlands parliamentary seat has voted for the government at every election since it was created in 1983, although this has more to do with decisions of the Boundary Commission than actual swings: the 1997-2010 constituency of that name included Kidsgrove, which was a strongly Labour-voting town at the time, whereas the current seat doesn't.  Since 2010 the local MP has been Karen Bradley, who was a Cabinet minister throughout the May administration: first as culture secretary, then with the Northern Ireland portfolio.  In a notorious 2018 interview with <em>The House</em> magazine, Bradley admitted that she hadn't fully understood Northern Irish politics before taking on the brief:

<blockquote>
“I didn’t understand things like when elections are fought for example in Northern Ireland, people who are nationalists don’t vote for unionist parties and vice-versa. So, the parties fight for the election within their own community. Actually, the unionist parties fight the elections against each other in unionist communities and nationalists in nationalist communities. That’s a very different world from the world I came from.” 
</blockquote>

If you're like Karen Bradley and looking with some bemusement at an unfamiliar political scene, don't worry: Andrew's Previews and Britain Elects are here to help you with that sort of thing.  However, Biddulph West ward is rather a tough place to brief readers on because its previous election results in this century defy analysis.  The 2003 election here returned two Lib Dem councillors and a Ratepayer; they were cleared out at the 2007 election at which an independent slate won all three seats.  Top of the poll that year, and at every election since, was Hilda Sheldon.

The independent domination of Biddulph West ward didn't stick.  In 2011 independent councillor Frank Harris stood down and his seat was gained by Labour.  In 2015 independent councillor Elaine Baddeley lost her seat to the Conservatives' county councillor Ian Lawson, producing a three-way Independent/Conservative/Labour split in the ward.  The 2019 election confirmed that unusual three-way split, with shares of the vote being 52% for Hilda Sheldon, 25% for Labour and 22% for the Conservatives - a rather poor Conservative performance, especially given that their slate was guaranteed one seat due to insufficient opposition candidates.

Hilda Sheldon was probably the person most responsible for my description of Biddulph as the Garden Town of Staffordshire: Sheldon was appointed MBE in the 2000 New Year Honours for services to Biddulph in Bloom, which she ran for nearly three decades alongside her day job running a shoe shop in the town.

On 8th June 2022 Hilda Sheldon's family reported her missing after she left her home without her keys, money or glasses.  Shortly afterwards her body was recovered from a nearby reservoir.  Sheldon was 80 years old.  An inquest in September heard that she had been behaving out of character in the months leading up to her death and had left a note for her family; the coroner recorded a verdict of suicide.

In October 2022, district and county councillor Ian Lawson passed away at the age of 85 after a long illness.  He had served on the county council since 2009 and on the district council since 2015, and he was chairman of Staffordshire county council for three years from 2012 to 2015.

A double by-election is being held today in Biddulph West ward to replace both the late councillors, the Conservatives' Ian Lawson and independent Hilda Sheldon.  Sheldon's popularity in the ward was such that there a lot of votes up for grabs here, and two indepdendent candidates are hoping to follow in her footsteps: Neil Eardley and Alistair McLoughlin both already represent this ward on Biddulph town council, and they are hoping to step up to Staffordshire Moorlands council.  The Conservative slate consists of Rathi Pragasam and Derek Stubbs: Pragasam, who is standing under the label "Local Conservative" while giving an address in Stoke-on-Trent, is a businesswoman described as "the Diversification Diva", while Stubbs does a lot of litter-picking in the town on a volunteer basis.  Given that Labour finished second here last time they might fancy their chances with their slate of Dave Proudlove and Charlotte "Charlie" Smith; Proudlove is a writer and photographer who contested Biddulph South ward in 2019, while Smith is a Biddulph town councillor.  Last on a ballot paper of seven candidates for two seats is Ian Waite for the Green Party.

Rathi Pragasam is also the defending Conservative candidate in the Biddulph North county council by-election.  Here she is up against Labour candidate Nigel Yates, who has been the party's Staffordshire Moorlands district councillor for Biddulph West ward since 2019.  Completing the county ballot paper is another Staffordshire Moorlands councillor: Andrew Hart has sat on the district council as an independent since winning a December 2004 by-election in Biddulph North ward, and he is also a Biddulph town councillor.  Those are your candidate lists for two fascinating by-elections.
