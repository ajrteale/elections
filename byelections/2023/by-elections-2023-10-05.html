There are three by-elections taking place on Thursday 5th October 2023, and let's start with the big one:
</p><p>
<h2>Rutherglen and Hamilton West</h2>
</p><p>
House of Commons; caused by the recall of Scottish National Party MP Margaret Ferrier.
</p><p>

</p><p>
We're very much in the dying days of this Westminster parliament.  The next general election can reasonably be expected some time next year, and the stage will soon be reached where any further vacancies in that parliament can simply be left for the voters to fill then.  This column doesn't seriously expect to be writing any Parliamentary Specials for most of next year, unless we have further instances of MPs Behaving Badly.
</p><p>
Before then we have three vacancies to fill in the House of Commons in October 2023, and the first one of these falls in the Glasgow urban area.  But this is not Glasgow.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/rutherglen-dear-old-ruglen.jpg" alt="Dear Auld Ruglen" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Welcome to Rutherglen, a town whose centre lies just three miles south-east of Glasgow city centre.  This has been a Royal Burgh for almost nine centuries, receiving that title from an 1126 charter of King David I.  It's now firmly within the urban sprawl of greater Glasgow, but - apart from a short period between 1975 and 1996 - Rutherglen is not Glasgow.
</p><p>
It's reasonable to ask why this is - what was it that enabled Rutherglen to fight off annexation by the big city?   Well, if we look at similar industrial conurbations in north-west England a pattern starts to emerge.  Bootle is very much part of the Liverpool urban area, but it has its docks - and Bootle has never been covered by the city council.  Salford and Stretford are very much part of the Manchester urban area, but Salford had its docks on the Ship Canal and Stretford has the heavy industry of Trafford Park - both of them remain independent of Manchester to this day.
</p><p>
Rutherglen had those advantages too, as a centre of heavy industry with a location on the River Clyde.  Until the mid-twentieth century coalmining was a major employer; ships were built and launched into the river; there is still a steelworks in operation; and there is the legacy of the J and J White chemical works, which has given Rutherglen a long-term problem with chromate contamination in the ground.  More on that story later.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/rutherglen-cuningar-loop.jpg" alt="Cuningar Loop" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Some idea of the scale of the industrial cleanup can be gleaned from a visit to the Cuningar Loop, a park located within a bend of the Clyde; once this was a sewage works for Glasgow, now it's filled with trees, public art and things for the kids to do on a nice day.  A footbridge has been thrown over the river to connect the site with the Dalmarnock Legacy Village, the former 2014 Commonwealth Games athletes' village in the east end of Glasgow.  There's even a boardwalk next to the Clyde, from which you might be able to glimpse the river through the ranks of toxic giant hogweed which grow on its banks.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/rutherglen-giant-hogweed.jpg" alt="Giant Hogweed" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
The Cuningar Loop is rather cut off from Rutherglen's town centre by the lines of communication which connect Glasgow city centre to the south.  First we have the M74 motorway, driven through here in 2008-11 to relieve the M8 to the north.  The M74 is elevated on a viaduct above the platforms of Rutherglen railway station, which is linked to the town centre by a footbridge over four tracks of the West Coast main line.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/rutherglen-station.jpg" alt="Rutherglen Station" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
On Rutherglen's unusually wide main street we can find the town hall, a Victorian building in the Scottish baronial style, next to the Mercat Cross.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/rutherglen-town-hall.jpg" alt="Rutherglen Town Hall" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Beyond the Town Hall can be found the Old Parish Church, with its unusual separate belltower - a leftover from a previous church on the site.  This church is a focus for Scottish nationalism thanks to its associations with William Wallace; in August 1305 this was the location where John de Menteith, the sheriff of Dumbarton, conspired to betray Wallace and hamd him over to the English.  Before the month was out, William Wallace's head was on top of a spike sticking out of London Bridge.  In the foreground of this picture is the memorial to a later figure in Rutherglen's history, William Murdoch; this isn't the former footballer who was the older brother of Lisbon Lion Bobby Murdoch, but a nineteenth-century provost of the town.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/rutherglen-belltower.jpg" alt="Rutherglen Town Hall" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
On the other side of the main street is an indoor shopping mall which, on my visit, had a stall outside staffed by campaigners from the Scottish Family Party.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/rutherglen-scfam.jpg" alt="Campaigning" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
To the south of here we have Rutherglen's housing, which has far outgrown the original burgh boundaries.  Some of the suburbs here are rather desirable places to live (Burnside), some less so (Fernhill).
</p><p>
There's a similar industrial history in Cambuslang, although without the burghal status; Cambuslang has a population of around 30,000 and merges seamlessly into Rutherglen, but it has never been an independent town of its own.  The housing stops at Halfway and at Newton, which is an important railway junction in Glasgow's local network.
</p><p>
At this point the River Clyde turns to running north-south, and a short period of greenbelt brings us to Blantyre.  This is of course the commercial centre of Malawi, whose name recalls a famous son of a different Blantyre a very long way away.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/blantyre-station.jpg" alt="Blantyre Station" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
David Livingstone, the missionary and African explorer, was born in 1813 to a family working in a cotton mill on the banks of the Clyde.  The house in Blantyre where he grew up still stands and has been turned into a museum in his memory which is certainly no hagiography: among a dazzling array of exhibits, the display does not shy away from Livingstone's mistakes and shortcomings, and it pays proper tribute to the members of the teams he led on his various explorations at quite some danger to themselves.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/blantyre-livingstone-birthplace.jpg" alt="David Livingstone Birthplace" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Outside is some parkland containing this striking sculpture by Ray Harryhausen, depicting an episode in 1844 when Dr Livingstone was nearly killed by a lion.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/blantyre-livingstone-memorial.jpg" alt="David Livingstone Statue" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Unfortunately, on my first attempted visit (a Thursday in September), the David Livingstone Birthplace was closed.  This sense of being thwarted continues as we cross the dual carriageway going to East Kilbride, and enter the town of Hamilton.  Which is home to this striking mausoleum, built as the final resting place for the Dukes of Hamilton (although they have since been reinterred elsehwere).
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/hamilton-mausoleum.jpg" alt="Hamilton, Mausoleum" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Apparently it's even more bizarre inside, and the interior space holds the record for the world's longest echo.  I was dying to get into the mausoleam and hear this for myself, but it turns out that South Lanarkshire Council only open it on two days a month and this was not one of those days.
</p><p>
In fact, I was doubly thwarted because the Hamilton Mausoleum is off-topic for this piece.  For some reason the Scottish Boundary Commissioners have had it in for the town of Hamilton over recent years: since 1997 it has been divided between two Westminster seats, and the part currently contained within Rutherglen and Hamilton West does not contain the mausoleam.  Or the racecourse.  Or the town centre.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/hamilton-lanark-county-buildings.jpg" alt="Lanark County Buildings" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Or even the Modernist Architectural Heaven Circa 1960 which is the wonderfully-retro Lanark County Buildings.  Opened in 1964 by the Queen Mother and clearly modelled on the UN headquarters in New York, this was originally the headquarters of Lanarkshire county council; since 1996 it has performed the same function for South Lanarkshire council.
</p><p>
All of that is frustratingly off-topic.  What we are left with is Hamilton's western residential areas, which are similar to Rutherglen and Cambuslang in that we have a mix of desirable suburbs (Earnock) and deprived areas (Udston).  We also have some quite large business parks next to the dual carriageway, which include this striking new building that houses the Lanarkshire campus of the University of the West of Scotland.

</p><p>
Rutherglen has been the centre of its own Westminster constituency since 1918.  Before then it was one component of an unusual feature of Scottish elections in times past: Districts of Burghs constituencies.  These were a series of disconnected smallish towns which were grouped together to form a single, if fragmented, urban constituency.  From 1885 until the seat's dissolution in 1918, Rutherglen was a member of the Kilmarnock District of Burghs, along with Dumbarton, Renfrew, Port Glasgow and Kilmarnock itself.
</p><p>
The Kilmarnock Burghs was normally a Liberal-inclined constituency in its final years, but in 1885 a split in the Liberal vote between outgoing MP John Dick Peddie (the architect who designed, among other things, the banking hall at the RBS head office in Edinburgh) and independent Liberal candidate Viscount Dalrymple (later the 11th Earl of Stair) split the left-wing vote and let in the Conservative candidate Peter Sturrock, the Provost of Kilmarnock, who owned collieries and was a civil engineer.  The Liberals resolved their differences for the 1886 election in which Sturrock was defeated by Stephen Williamson, who co-founded the Liverpool shipping line Balfour Williamson and Company and had previously been MP for St Andrews in 1880-85.

In 1895 Williamson was defeated by the Conservative candidate John Denny, whose business was also in ships: he was from the family which ran Denny's shipyard in Dumbarton.  Denny stood down in 1906 and the Liberal landslde of that year turned Kilmarnock Burghs into a safe Liberal seat: it returned Adam Rainy, a surgeon oculist.  John Denny had been a major supporter of women's suffrage, and Adam Rainy's wife Annabelle was also a leading Scottish suffragist.

Adam Rainy died in 1911 at the young age of 49.  The resulting Kilmarnock Burghs by-election of 26th September 1911 returned a Liberal candidate with a famous name.  Will Gladstone was the grandson of the famous Liberal prime minister William Ewart Gladstone, and his election made him the fourth generation of Gladstones to serve in the Commons.  He had been president of the Oxford Union in 1907, and had spent most of 1911 in Washington DC as an honorary attaché at the British embassy.  At the time of his election, he had just been appointed as Lord-Lieutenant of Flintshire at the age of 26.  Gladstone saw off Conservative candidate Sir John Rees, who had previously been a Liberal MP for Montgomery Boroughs and before that was a colonial administrator in India; and the seat's first Labour candidate Thomas McKerrell, a coalminer and Kilmarnock councillor who was endorsed by the local womens' suffrage groups.

When the First World War broke out, Will Gladstone MP was commissioned as an officer in the Royal Welch Fusiliers, and he was sent to France with his regiment in March 1915.  On 13th April, six days after being promoted to lieutenant, Gladstone was shot dead by a sniper near Laventie in northern France.  He was 29 years old.  Unusually for that war, his body was repatriated to the UK, and Gladstone now lies at rest in the Flintshire village of Hawarden.  The resulting Kilmarnock Burghs by-election of 28th May 1915 fell under the wartime political truce, and the new Liberal candidate Alexander Shaw was elected unopposed.  Shaw was a young lawyer of a similar age and background to Gladstone, which meant that he spent much of his time as MP for Kilmarnock Burghs away fighting in the war; he was in the Royal Marine Artillery, and he survived the Battle of the Somme.

During this period Cambuslang, Blantyre and most of what's now the urban sprawl were part of the Mid Lanarkshire parliamentary seat, which also took in Larkhall, Wishaw, Newmains and the open space which would become Castlemilk.  This seat was dominated by the coalmining industry, but in 1885 the Labour party lay in the future and many working men did not yet have the vote.  As a result of this, Mid Lanarkshire was a Liberal seat throughout the period 1885-1918.  Its first MP was Stephen Mason, a former Glasgow merchant and JP, who managed to increase his majority against the national trend in 1886 by emphasising his support for Irish home rule.

Mason resigned from the Commons in 1888, and the resulting Mid Lanarkshire by-election of 27th April 1888 was a harbinger of things to come.  This the first parliamentary contest for a young man called Keir Hardie, who was a Lanarkshire man and had previously worked and organised strikes in the constituency's collieries.  He would also later campaign for the rights of workers at the J and J White chesmicals factory in Rutherglen, exposing their poor working conditions.  Hardie, standing as an Independent Labour candidate, finished last with just 8% of the vote; he saw that as a promising start, and the Labour Party which he went on to the first leader of has had rather more success in the area since.  However, in this by-election he got nowehere near the winning candidate John Philipps.

Philipps was one of three brothers who all served as MPs, along with the Indian army officer Ivor Philipps and the fraudster Owen Philipps, Lord Kylsant, who has appeared in this column before.  He resigned as MP for Mid Lanarkshire in 1894, but later served in the Commons as MP for Pembrokeshire and ended up in the Lords as Viscount St Davids.

The second Mid Lanarkshire by-election, to replace John Philipps, took place on 5th April 1894 and turned into a close contest.  Robert Harington-Stuart, a Crimean War veteran standing for the Liberal Unionists, lost by 330 votes to the new Liberal candidate James Caldwell.  Caldwell was a Glasgow businessman who had previously been in the Liberal Unionists himself: he had been elected on their ticket as MP for Glasgow St Rollox in 1886, but subsequently crossed the floor to the Liberals.  He was re-elected in 1895, holding his seat by just 71 votes against the Conservative landslide of that year.  For his final term in office Caldwell's party affiliation was less important, as he served as a Deputy Speaker during the 1906-10 parliament.

The two 1910 elections in Mid Lanarkshire both returned John Howard Whitehouse, whose career up to that point had included a number of university posts in Birmingham and Manchester, social work for the Cadbury family in Birmingham and a devotion to the life and works of John Ruskin.  The January 1910 <em>Times Guide to the House of Commons</em> also recounts that Whitehouse was "well known for his interest in boys"; by which the <em>Times</em> meant education and child labour; Whitehouse would go on to found Bembridge School, a now-closed public school on the Isle of Wight.

The redistribution of 1918 dissolved the Kilmarnock District of Burghs and created a Rutherglen parliamentary seat for the first time, with quite similar boundaries to the Holyrood seat of today: the main difference was that the Rutherglen seat of 1918-50 included Carmunnock, which was not yet part of Glasgow at this point in time.  Hamilton (which had previously been one of the towns in the Stirling District of Burghs) also became the centre of its own parliamentary seat, which at this point had similar boundaries to the modern Holyrood seat called Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse.  Inflation is a problem in constituency names these days as well as in everything else.

These boundary changes resulted in a clearout in the area's parliamentary representation.  The outgoing Mid Lanarkshire MP John Howard Whitehouse sought re-election in 1918 in the new Hamilton seat, where he finished last and lost his deposit; while Alexander Shaw transferred successfully from the old Kilmarnock Burghs to the new Kilmarnock constituency.

The Liberal nomination for the new Rutherglen seat instead went to Adam Keir Rodger, a former Provost of Rutherglen who had founded and ran the Scottish Temperance Life Assurance Company.  Rodger had founded the company to exclusively serve teetotallers, which was an interesting choice given that his father had been a brewer.  Scottish Mutual, as the company became known, remained in business for 108 years until it was taken over by Abbey National in 1991.  Rodger's single term in Parliament didn't last that long, but in 1918 he had the coalition government's coupon and he won easily.

Rodger's retirement from the Commons in 1922 marked the end of the Liberal era and the start of the Labour ascendancy in Rutherglen.  It was an immediate end to the Liberal era in candidate terms, for the 1922 Rutherglen election was a contest between Labour and the National Liberals - the Liberal faction associated with Lloyd George.  The National Liberal candidate John Train, an architect who would later serve as a Conservative MP in Glasgow, lost by a 55-45 margin to Rutherglen's first Labour MP William Wright.

Wright succeesfully navigated the turbulent waters of 1920s British politics to win four terms of office as MP for Rutherglen.  He died in office in 1931 at the age of 68, forcing the first Rutherglen by-election on 21st May 1931.  To defend this Labour selected Keir Hardie's younger brother David Hardie, while the Conservative candidate was Herbert Moss, a former sailor who had recently been a Glasgow councillor.  The seat saw a sharp swing to the Conservatives as the wheels started to come off the second Macdonald Labour government; Hardie held the by-election, but his majority was cut to 883 votes.  His service in the Commons proved to be very short: the general election in October 1931 saw a rematch between Hardie and Moss, and this time the Unionist candidate won by over 5,000 votes.

Herbert Moss' single term as the first Conservative or Unionist MP for Rutherglen got him into the MPs Behaving Badly file.  The scandal which brought him down involved the Modern School of Art Union.  This was not a trade union.  Art Unions were nineteenth- and early twentieth-century associations which aimed to promote and support comtemporary art and artists.  The way in which this was done was that works of art (normally pictures) would be exhibited and then put up for sale in an unusual manner: members of the art union could then enter a lottery, with the prize being either a specified work of art or a cash sum to be spent on an exhibit of the winner's choice.

The difficulty with this idea was that private lotteries were illegal in those days.  A piece of nineteenth-century legislation, the Art Unions Act 1846, had legalised lotteries run by Art Unions; but the law around this area was still a minefield, and Herbert Moss fell foul of it.  In 1934 he was fined £50 for irregularities around the Modern School of Art Union's Cesarewitch draw, alongside another Scottish Unionist MP and a former Glasgow town councillor; the magistrate went so far as to describe the draw as a swindle.  Moss' constituency party in Rutherglen was not impressed and passed a motion in January 1935 calling for his resignation; he didn't resign, but he did leave Parliament at the general election later that year.

(Incidentally, the Art Unions Act 1846 was repealed in 2004 on the grounds that it was obsolete.  There are no longer any art unions in existence, and if one were to be set up now the law around private lotteries is much more relaxed these days.)

Whether Moss had been deselected or not, in 1935 Allan Chapman became the new Unionist MP for Rutherglen: he defeated David Hardie by 20,712 votes to 20,131, a small majority of 581.  Chapman served the seat throughout the war years, and joined the wartime coalition government: first as Assistant Postmaster-General, then as a junior minister in the Scottish Office.  He was swept away in the Attlee landslide by Labour candidate Gilbert McAllister, who defeated Chapman by 8,002 votes in 1945.

Things were rather calmer in the Hamilton section of this constituency, which was one of the few seats to have a Labour MP continuously during the inter-war period.  For almost all of that period the MP here was Duncan Graham, a coalminer and miner's union leader who served as the Hamilton MP from 1918 until his death in 1942.  The resulting first Hamilton by-election on 29th January 1943 saw another coalminer and trade unionist, Tom Fraser, defeat an independent candidate very easily: the wartime political truce meant that Fraser did not face Unionist opposition in that by-election.

The redistribution of 1950 reduced the size of the Rutherglen constituency: the fields which would shortly become Castlemilk had been annexed by Glasgow, while Blantyre was transferred into the Hamilton constituency.  This may well have improved the Unionist position in Rutherglen, and on these boundaries the Rutherglen seat was initially a key Labour-Conservative marginal.  Gilbert McAllister held his seat in 1950 by just 695 votes, with a rare Liberal intervention perhaps proving decisive; in 1951 Rutherglen was one of the Unionist gains which delivered the second Churchill government, with a margin of 352 votes.

The new MP here was Richard Brooman-White, who was from the family which ran and owned the J and J White chemical works in Rutherglen.  Brooman-White had been a journalist and a radio broadcaster before spending most of the Second World War working for MI5 and MI6.  In Parliament he specialised in the steel industry before joining governemnt: first in the Whips Office, then as a junior minister in the Scottish Office.  He had a marginal seat throughout this period, but son three terms of office.

In late 1963 Brooman-White's health failed: he resigned from the Commons in December, and died a month later.  The resulting Rutherglen by-election of 14th May 1964 took place in the final days of the Douglas-Home administration.




We should pause here to salute one of the giants of psephology.  The Unionist election agent in the 1964 Rutherglen by-election was F W S Craig, who was one of the first researchers to properly compile and archive statistics on elections.  His series of <em>British Parliamentary Election Statistics</em> books, containing information on elections from 1832 to 1983 across give volumes, remains an industry-standard reference work, and he also published books on parliamentary boundaries and results for elections to Greater London Council and his native Glasgow Corporation.  Craig never achieved electoral success in Glasgow, although he was elected to Chichester council and West Sussex county council in the 1970s and 1980s.  Sadly, F W S Craig committed suicide in 1989 after his marriage failed: he was only 59 when he died, and with this being in the pre-internet era much of his work has now faded from the memory of today's psephologists.  Which is a shame: as a pioneer of computer technology, he would no doubt have enjoyed the early internet era.






<!--    There will now follow a deep dive into MPs for this area since 1885,
        a discussion of what happened to Margaret Ferrier and why she is an MP Behaving Badly,
        and commentary on the most recent election results for this area to include: -->
</p><p>
If we take as a best fit for the constituency the Rutherglen and Cambuslang wards plus Blantyre and Hamilton West and Earnock, then the 2022 local elections across the seat gave 39% of the first preferences to the SNP, 34% to Labour, and 11% each to the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives; with proportional representation in effect, that translated to 9 SNP councillors, 7 Labour and 3 Lib Dems.  Labour carried Blantyre ward, with the SNP topping the poll everywhere else.  The reason why the Lib Dems won three seats and the Conservatives nothing is mostly to do with the Lib Dem vote being very concentrated in the three wards where they won seats, while the Conservatives were quite evenly distributed.
</p><p>
But because this is Scotland we can do a bit better than that, thanks to the tireless work of Ballot Box Scotland's Allan Faulds who has collected the full breakdown of first preferences by <em>polling district</em> from the 2022 Scottish local elections.  Because of the way in which small polling districts were merged to preserve the anonymity of the ballot, it's still not possible to get a completely accurate picture of how the constituency voted; but if we do a better fit by adding in polling districts 135 to 137 and 175 from Hamilton North and East ward, adding polling district 150 from Hamilton South ward and deducting polling district 147 from Hamilton West and Earnock, the above percentages - don't actually change very much, but we can see that the Conservatives polled third across the constituency rather than the Lib Dems, with 10.9% against 10.5%.
