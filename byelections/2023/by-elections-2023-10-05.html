</p><p>
There are three by-elections taking place on Thursday 5th October 2023, and let's start with the big one:
</p><p>
<h2>Rutherglen and Hamilton West</h2>
</p><p>
House of Commons; caused by the recall of Scottish National Party MP Margaret Ferrier.
</p><p>

</p><p>
We're very much in the dying days of this Westminster parliament.  The next general election can reasonably be expected some time next year, and the stage will soon be reached where any further vacancies in that parliament can simply be left for the voters to fill then.  This column doesn't seriously expect to be writing any Parliamentary Specials for most of next year, unless we have further instances of MPs Behaving Badly.
</p><p>
Before then we have three vacancies to fill in the House of Commons in October 2023, and the first one of these falls in the Glasgow urban area.  But this is not Glasgow.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/rutherglen-dear-old-ruglen.jpg" alt="Dear Auld Ruglen" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Welcome to Rutherglen, a town whose centre lies just three miles south-east of Glasgow city centre.  This has been a Royal Burgh for almost nine centuries, receiving that title from an 1126 charter of King David I.  It's now firmly within the urban sprawl of greater Glasgow, but - apart from a short period between 1975 and 1996 - Rutherglen is not Glasgow.
</p><p>
It's reasonable to ask why this is - what was it that enabled Rutherglen to fight off annexation by the big city?   Well, if we look at similar industrial conurbations in north-west England a pattern starts to emerge.  Bootle is very much part of the Liverpool urban area, but it has its docks - and Bootle has never been covered by the city council.  Salford and Stretford are very much part of the Manchester urban area, but Salford had its docks on the Ship Canal and Stretford has the heavy industry of Trafford Park - both of them remain independent of Manchester to this day.
</p><p>
Rutherglen had those advantages too, as a centre of heavy industry with a location on the River Clyde.  Until the mid-twentieth century coalmining was a major employer; ships were built and launched into the river; there is still a steelworks in operation; and there is the legacy of the J and J White chemical works, which has given Rutherglen a long-term problem with chromate contamination in the ground.
</p><p>
One of the many dumping grounds for chromate waste in this area was Shawfield Stadium, next to Rutherglen Bridge which marks the point at which this constituency ends and Glasgow proper begins.  Shawfield was the home of the Scottish Football League side Clyde FC until 1986, and also hosted the Glasgow Tigers speedway team for a while, but it was predominantly a greyhound racing venue - the last official greyhound track in Scotland - until the COVID-19 pandemic forced its closure in 2020.  Since then Shawfield Stadium has lain derelict, and following the death of its owner last year it looks unlikely to reopen.  Redevelopment for housing could be a possibility, if something can be done about the chromate problem.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/rutherglen-cuningar-loop.jpg" alt="Cuningar Loop" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Some idea of the scale of the industrial cleanup can be gleaned from a visit to the Cuningar Loop, a park located within a bend of the Clyde; once this was a sewage works for Glasgow, now it's filled with trees, public art and things for the kids to do on a nice day.  A footbridge has been thrown over the river to connect the site with the Dalmarnock Legacy Village, the former 2014 Commonwealth Games athletes' village in the east end of Glasgow.  There's even a boardwalk next to the Clyde, from which you might be able to glimpse the river through the ranks of toxic giant hogweed which grow on its banks.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/rutherglen-giant-hogweed.jpg" alt="Giant Hogweed" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
The Cuningar Loop is rather cut off from Rutherglen's town centre by the lines of communication which connect Glasgow city centre to the south.  First we have the M74 motorway, driven through here in 2008-11 to relieve the M8 to the north.  The M74 is elevated on a viaduct above the platforms of Rutherglen railway station, which is linked to the town centre by a footbridge over four tracks of the West Coast main line.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/rutherglen-station.jpg" alt="Rutherglen Station" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
On Rutherglen's unusually wide main street we can find the town hall, a Victorian building in the Scottish baronial style, next to the Mercat Cross.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/rutherglen-town-hall.jpg" alt="Rutherglen Town Hall" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Beyond the Town Hall can be found the Old Parish Church, with its unusual separate belltower - a leftover from a previous church on the site.  This church is a focus for Scottish nationalism thanks to its associations with William Wallace; in August 1305 this was the location where John de Menteith, the sheriff of Dumbarton, conspired to betray Wallace and hand him over to the English.  Before the month was out, William Wallace's head was on top of a spike sticking out of London Bridge.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/rutherglen-belltower.jpg" alt="Rutherglen Town Hall" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
On the other side of the main street is an indoor shopping mall which, on my visit, had a stall outside staffed by campaigners from the Scottish Family Party.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/rutherglen-scfam.jpg" alt="Campaigning" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
To the south of here we have Rutherglen's housing, which has far outgrown the original burgh boundaries.  Some of the suburbs here are rather desirable places to live (Burnside), some less so (Fernhill).
</p><p>
There's a similar industrial history in Cambuslang, although without the burghal status; Cambuslang has a population of around 30,000 and merges seamlessly into Rutherglen, but it has never been an independent town of its own.  The housing stops at Halfway and at Newton, which is an important railway junction in Glasgow's local network.
</p><p>
At this point the River Clyde turns to running north-south, and a short period of greenbelt brings us to Blantyre.  This is of course the commercial centre of Malawi, whose name recalls a famous son of a different Blantyre a very long way away.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/blantyre-station.jpg" alt="Blantyre Station" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
David Livingstone, the missionary and African explorer, was born in 1813 to a family working in a cotton mill on the banks of the Clyde.  The house in Blantyre where he grew up still stands and has been turned into a museum in his memory which is certainly no hagiography: among a dazzling array of exhibits, the display does not shy away from Livingstone's mistakes and shortcomings, and it pays proper tribute to the members of the teams he led on his various explorations at quite some danger to themselves.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/blantyre-livingstone-birthplace.jpg" alt="David Livingstone Birthplace" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Outside is some parkland containing this striking sculpture by Ray Harryhausen, depicting an episode in 1844 when Dr Livingstone was nearly killed by a lion.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/blantyre-livingstone-memorial.jpg" alt="David Livingstone Statue" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Unfortunately, on my first attempted visit (a Thursday in September), the David Livingstone Birthplace was closed.  This sense of being thwarted continues as we cross the dual carriageway going to East Kilbride, and enter the town of Hamilton.  Which is home to this striking mausoleum, built as the final resting place for the Dukes of Hamilton (although they have since been reinterred elsewhere).
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/hamilton-mausoleum.jpg" alt="Hamilton, Mausoleum" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Apparently it's even more bizarre inside, and the interior space holds the record for the world's longest echo.  I was dying to get into the mausoleam and hear this for myself, but it turns out that South Lanarkshire Council only open it on two days a month and this was not one of those days.
</p><p>
In fact, I was doubly thwarted because the Hamilton Mausoleum is off-topic for this piece.  For some reason the Scottish Boundary Commissioners have had it in for the town of Hamilton over recent years: since 1997 it has been divided between two Westminster seats, and the part currently contained within Rutherglen and Hamilton West does not contain the mausoleum.  Or the racecourse.  Or the town centre.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/hamilton-lanark-county-buildings.jpg" alt="Lanark County Buildings" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Or even the Modernist Architectural Heaven Circa 1960 which is the wonderfully-retro Lanark County Buildings.  Opened in 1964 by the Queen Mother and clearly modelled on the UN headquarters in New York, this was originally the headquarters of Lanarkshire county council; since 1996 it has performed the same function for South Lanarkshire council.
</p><p>
All of that is frustratingly off-topic.  What we are left with is Hamilton's western residential areas, which are similar to Rutherglen and Cambuslang in that we have a mix of desirable suburbs (Earnock) and deprived areas (Udston).  We also have some quite large business parks next to the dual carriageway, which include this striking new building that houses the Lanarkshire campus of the University of the West of Scotland.

</p><p>
Rutherglen has been the centre of its own Westminster constituency since 1918.  Before then it was one component of an unusual feature of Scottish elections in times past: Districts of Burghs constituencies.  These were a series of disconnected smallish towns which were grouped together to form a single, if fragmented, urban constituency.  From 1885 until the seat's dissolution in 1918, Rutherglen was a member of the Kilmarnock District of Burghs, along with Dumbarton, Renfrew, Port Glasgow and Kilmarnock itself.
</p><p>
The Kilmarnock Burghs was normally a Liberal-inclined constituency in its final years, but in 1885 a split in the Liberal vote between outgoing MP John Dick Peddie (the architect who designed, among other things, the banking hall at the RBS head office in Edinburgh) and independent Liberal candidate Viscount Dalrymple (later the 11th Earl of Stair) split the left-wing vote and let in the Conservative candidate Peter Sturrock, the Provost of Kilmarnock, who owned collieries and was a civil engineer.  The Liberals resolved their differences for the 1886 election in which Sturrock was defeated by Stephen Williamson, who co-founded the Liverpool shipping line Balfour Williamson and Company and had previously been MP for St Andrews in 1880-85.
</p><p>
In 1895 Williamson was defeated by the Conservative candidate John Denny, whose business was also in ships: he was from the family which ran Denny's shipyard in Dumbarton.  Denny stood down in 1906 and the Liberal landslide of that year turned Kilmarnock Burghs into a safe Liberal seat: it returned Adam Rainy, a surgeon oculist.  John Denny had been a major supporter of women's suffrage, and Adam Rainy's wife Annabelle was also a leading Scottish suffragist.
</p><p>
Adam Rainy died in 1911 at the young age of 49.  The resulting Kilmarnock Burghs by-election of 26th September 1911 returned a Liberal candidate with a famous name.  Will Gladstone was the grandson of the famous Liberal prime minister William Ewart Gladstone, and his election made him the fourth generation of Gladstones to serve in the Commons.  He had been president of the Oxford Union in 1907, and had spent most of 1911 in Washington DC as an honorary attaché at the British embassy.  At the time of his election, he had just been appointed as Lord-Lieutenant of Flintshire at the age of 26.  Gladstone saw off Conservative candidate Sir John Rees, who had previously been a Liberal MP for Montgomery Boroughs and before that was a colonial administrator in India; and the seat's first Labour candidate Thomas McKerrell, a coalminer and Kilmarnock councillor who was endorsed by the local womens' suffrage groups.
</p><p>
When the First World War broke out, Will Gladstone MP was commissioned as an officer in the Royal Welch Fusiliers, and he was sent to France with his regiment in March 1915.  On 13th April, six days after being promoted to lieutenant, Gladstone was shot dead by a sniper near Laventie in northern France.  He was 29 years old.  Unusually for that war, his body was repatriated to the UK, and Gladstone now lies at rest in the Flintshire village of Hawarden.  The resulting Kilmarnock Burghs by-election of 28th May 1915 fell under the wartime political truce, and the new Liberal candidate Alexander Shaw was elected unopposed.  Shaw was a young lawyer of a similar age and background to Gladstone, which meant that he spent much of his time as MP for Kilmarnock Burghs away fighting in the war; he was in the Royal Marine Artillery, and he survived the Battle of the Somme.
</p><p>
During this period Cambuslang, Blantyre and most of what's now the urban sprawl were part of the Mid Lanarkshire parliamentary seat, which also took in Larkhall, Wishaw, Newmains and the open space which would become Castlemilk.  This seat was dominated by the coalmining industry, but in 1885 the Labour party lay in the future and many working men did not yet have the vote.  As a result of this, Mid Lanarkshire was a Liberal seat throughout the period 1885-1918.  Its first MP was Stephen Mason, a former Glasgow merchant and JP, who managed to increase his majority against the national trend in 1886 by emphasising his support for Irish home rule.
</p><p>
Mason resigned from the Commons in 1888, and the resulting Mid Lanarkshire by-election of 27th April 1888 was a harbinger of things to come.  This the first parliamentary contest for a young socialist called Keir Hardie, who was a Lanarkshire man and had previously worked and organised strikes in the constituency's collieries.  He would also later campaign for the rights of workers at the J and J White chemicals factory in Rutherglen, exposing their poor working conditions.  Hardie, standing as an Independent Labour candidate, finished last with just 8% of the vote; he saw that as a promising start, and as we shall see shortly the Labour Party which he went on to become the first leader of has had rather more success in the area since.  However, in this by-election Keir Hardie got nowhere near the winning Liberal candidate John Philipps.
</p><p>
Philipps was one of three brothers who all served as MPs, along with the Indian army officer Ivor Philipps and the fraudster Owen Philipps, Lord Kylsant, who has appeared in this column before.  John Philipps resigned as MP for Mid Lanarkshire in 1894, but later returned to the Commons as MP for Pembrokeshire and ended up in the Lords as Viscount St Davids.
</p><p>
The second Mid Lanarkshire by-election, to replace John Philipps, took place on 5th April 1894 and turned into a close contest.  Robert Harington-Stuart, a Crimean War veteran standing for the Liberal Unionists, lost by 330 votes to the new Liberal candidate James Caldwell.  Caldwell was a Glasgow businessman who had previously been in the Liberal Unionists himself: he had been elected on their ticket as MP for Glasgow St Rollox in 1886, but subsequently crossed the floor to the Liberals.  He was re-elected in 1895, holding his seat by just 71 votes against the Conservative landslide of that year.  For his final term in office Caldwell's party affiliation was less important, as he served as a Deputy Speaker during the 1906-10 parliament.
</p><p>
The two 1910 elections in Mid Lanarkshire both returned John Howard Whitehouse, whose career up to that point had included a number of university posts in Birmingham and Manchester, social work for the Cadbury family in Birmingham and a devotion to the life and works of John Ruskin.  The January 1910 <em>Times Guide to the House of Commons</em> also recounts that Whitehouse was "well known for his interest in boys"; by which the <em>Times</em> meant education and child labour; Whitehouse would go on to found Bembridge School, a now-closed public school on the Isle of Wight.
</p><p>
The redistribution of 1918 dissolved the Kilmarnock District of Burghs and created a Rutherglen parliamentary seat for the first time, with quite similar boundaries to the Holyrood seat of today: the main difference was that the Rutherglen seat of 1918-50 included Carmunnock, which was not yet part of Glasgow at this point in time.  Hamilton (which had previously been one of the towns in the Stirling District of Burghs) also became the centre of its own parliamentary seat, which at this point had similar boundaries to the modern Holyrood seat called Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse.  Inflation is a problem in constituency names these days as well as in everything else.
</p><p>
These boundary changes resulted in a clearout in the area's parliamentary representation.  The outgoing Mid Lanarkshire MP John Howard Whitehouse sought re-election in 1918 in the new Hamilton seat, where he finished last and lost his deposit; while Alexander Shaw transferred successfully from the old Kilmarnock Burghs to the new Kilmarnock constituency.
</p><p>
The Liberal nomination for the new Rutherglen seat instead went to Adam Keir Rodger, a former Provost of Rutherglen who had founded and ran the Scottish Temperance Life Assurance Company.  Rodger had founded the company to exclusively serve teetotallers, which was an interesting choice given that his father had been a brewer.  Scottish Mutual, as the company became known, remained in business for 108 years until it was taken over by Abbey National in 1991.  Rodger's single term in Parliament didn't last that long, but in 1918 he had the coalition government's coupon and he won easily.
</p><p>
Rodger's retirement from the Commons in 1922 marked the end of the Liberal era and the start of the Labour ascendancy in Rutherglen.  It was an immediate end to the Liberal era in candidate terms, for the 1922 Rutherglen election was a contest between Labour and the National Liberals - the Liberal faction associated with Lloyd George.  The National Liberal candidate John Train, an architect who would later serve as a Conservative MP in Glasgow, lost by a 55-45 margin to Rutherglen's first Labour MP William Wright.
</p><p>
Wright successfully navigated the turbulent waters of 1920s British politics to win four terms of office as MP for Rutherglen.  He died in office in 1931 at the age of 68, forcing the first Rutherglen by-election on 21st May 1931.  To defend this Labour selected Keir Hardie's younger brother David Hardie, while the Conservative candidate was Herbert Moss, a former sailor who had recently been a Glasgow councillor.  The seat saw a sharp swing to the Conservatives as the wheels started to come off the second Macdonald Labour government; Hardie held the by-election, but his majority was cut to 883 votes.  His service in the Commons proved to be very short: the general election in October 1931 saw a rematch between Hardie and Moss, and this time the Unionist candidate won by over 5,000 votes.
</p><p>
Herbert Moss' single term as the first Conservative or Unionist MP for Rutherglen got him into the MPs Behaving Badly file.  The scandal which brought him down involved the Modern School of Art Union, a body which needs some explanation.  Art unions were nineteenth- and early twentieth-century associations which aimed to promote and support contemporary art and artists.  The way in which this was done was that works of art (normally pictures) would be exhibited and then put up for sale in an unusual manner: members of the art union could then enter a lottery, with the prize being either a specified work of art or a cash sum to be spent on an exhibit of the winner's choice.
</p><p>
The difficulty with this idea was that private lotteries were normally illegal in those days.  A piece of nineteenth-century legislation, the Art Unions Act 1846, had legalised lotteries run by Art Unions; but the law around this area was still a minefield, and Herbert Moss fell foul of it.  In 1934 he was fined £50 for irregularities around the Modern School of Art Union's Cesarewitch draw, alongside another Scottish Unionist MP and a former Glasgow town councillor; the magistrate went so far as to describe the draw as a swindle.  Moss' constituency party in Rutherglen was not impressed and passed a motion in January 1935 calling for his resignation; he didn't resign, but he did leave Parliament at the general election later that year.
</p><p>
(Incidentally, the Art Unions Act 1846 was repealed in 2004 on the grounds that it was obsolete.  There are no longer any art unions in existence, and if one were to be set up now the law around private lotteries is much more relaxed these days.)
</p><p>
Whether Moss had been deselected or not, in 1935 Allan Chapman became the new Unionist MP for Rutherglen: he defeated David Hardie by 20,712 votes to 20,131, a small majority of 581.  Chapman served the seat throughout the war years, and joined the wartime coalition government: first as Assistant Postmaster-General, then as a junior minister in the Scottish Office.  He was swept away in the Attlee landslide by Labour candidate Gilbert McAllister, who defeated Chapman by 8,002 votes in 1945.
</p><p>
Things were rather calmer in the Hamilton section of this constituency, which was one of the few seats to have a Labour MP continuously during the inter-war period.  For almost all of that period the MP here was Duncan Graham, a coalminer and miner's union leader who served as the Hamilton MP from 1918 until his death in 1942; even in the Labour disaster year of 1931, Graham had a respectable majority here.  The resulting first Hamilton by-election on 29th January 1943 saw another coalminer and trade unionist, Tom Fraser, defeat an independent candidate very easily: the wartime political truce meant that Fraser did not face Unionist opposition in that by-election.
</p><p>
The redistribution of 1950 reduced the size of the Rutherglen constituency: the fields which would shortly become Castlemilk had been annexed by Glasgow, while Blantyre was transferred into the Hamilton constituency.  This change improved the Unionist position in Rutherglen, and on these boundaries the Rutherglen seat was initially a key Labour-Conservative marginal.  Gilbert McAllister held his seat in 1950 by just 695 votes, with a rare Liberal intervention perhaps proving decisive; in 1951 Rutherglen was one of the Unionist gains which delivered the second Churchill government, with a margin of 352 votes.
</p><p>
The new MP here was Richard Brooman-White, who was from the family which ran and owned the J and J White chemical works in Rutherglen.  Brooman-White had been a journalist and a radio broadcaster before spending most of the Second World War working for MI5 and MI6.  In Parliament he specialised in the steel industry before joining government: first in the Whips Office, then as a junior minister in the Scottish Office.  He had a marginal seat throughout this period, but won three terms of office.
</p><p>
In late 1963 Richard Brooman-White's health failed: he resigned from the Commons in December, and died a month later.  The resulting Rutherglen by-election of 14th May 1964 took place in the final days of the Douglas-Home administration, on a day when the Conservatives were defending four parliamentary by-elections; three of these were in safe seats in southern or eastern England, but in Rutherglen the party was defending a majority of 1,522 in what was seen as a rehearsal for the general election due later that year.  The Unionists selected as their defending candidate Iain Sproat, a journalist who was embarking on a rather accident-prone electoral career; he went on to become MP for Aberdeen South in 1970, attempted a failed chicken run to Roxburgh and Berwickshire in 1983 while the Conservatives held his old seat, and later served as MP for Harwich in the 1992-97 parliament for most of which period he was the Minister for Sport.  The Labour candidate was Glasgow councillor Gregor Mackenzie, who worked as a sales manager.  In a straight fight between the two candidates after the Scottish National Party decided not to stand, Mackenzie gained the Rutherglen by-election for Labour by 18,885 votes to 15,138, a majority of 3,747.  At the general election five months later Mackenzie confirmed the by-election gain, winning a rematch against Sproat with a margin of 3,530 votes.
</p><p>
We should pause here to salute one of the giants of psephology, upon whose shoulders much of this column stands.  The Unionist election agent in the 1964 Rutherglen by-election was F W S Craig, who was one of the first researchers to properly compile and archive statistics on elections.  His series of <em>British Parliamentary Election Statistics</em> books, containing information on elections from 1832 to 1983 across five volumes, remains an industry-standard reference work, and he also published books on parliamentary boundaries and on results for elections to the Greater London Council and his native Glasgow Corporation.  Craig never achieved electoral success in Glasgow, although he was elected to Chichester council and West Sussex county council in the 1970s and 1980s.  Sadly, F W S Craig committed suicide in 1989 after his marriage broke down: he was only 59 when he died, and with this being in the pre-internet era much of his work has now faded from the memory of today's psephologists.  Which is a shame: as a pioneer of computer technology, he would no doubt have enjoyed the early internet era.
</p><p>
In the political drama stakes, the 1964 Rutherglen by-election has been eclipsed by a poll which took place in Hamilton three years later.  After winning the wartime 1943 by-election Tom Fraser went on to have a long parliamentary career in a very safe Labour seat: only in 1959 did he poll less than two-thirds of the vote, and then only marginally.  Fraser served in the Attlee government as a junior minister in the Scotland Office, and was appointed by Harold Wilson as his first Minister of Transport; in that role Fraser oversaw many of the Beeching rail closures, and imposed a speed limit of 70 miles per hour on British motorways.
</p><p>
In 1967 Tom Fraser resigned from the Commons to become chairman of the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board.  The resulting Hamilton by-election of 2nd November 1967 broke the mould of Scottish politics.  Labour selected Alexander Wilson, a coalminer and local councillor in the Third District Council of Lanarkshire.  (At the time Lanarkshire outside the burghs was divided into nine Landward Districts which were numbered from First to Ninth; the Third district was based on Carluke and villages to the north and east of Lanark.)  His main challenge ended up coming from the unexpected direction of Winnie Ewing, a solicitor and secretary of the Scottish Bar Association who was standing for a fringe political movement called the Scottish National Party.  The SNP had contested Hamilton only once before, polling 6% and losing their deposit in 1959; and right up until polling day Labour's Wilson was a strong favourite with the bookmakers.  In a huge upset, Ewing defeated Wilson by 18,397 votes to 16,598, a majority of 1,799, to become only the second ever Scottish National Party MP.  She lost the rematch to Wilson in 1970, but later served as MP for Moray and Nairn before representing the Highlands and Islands in both the European and Scottish Parliaments.  The SNP have been ever-present in the House of Commons since Winnie Ewing's first election.
</p><p>
The 1974 redistribution created a brand-new constituency based on the New Town of East Kilbride, which comes into our story because the original version of the East Kilbride seat included Blantyre.  Throughout the period from 1974 to 1983 (when Blantyre went back into the Hamilton seat), the MP for East Kilbride was Labour's Maurice Miller.  He was a medic and former Glasgow councillor who had entered the Commons in 1964 as Labour MP for Glasgrow Kelvingrove, before transferring here when the 1974 boundary changes reduced the number of seats in Glasgow.  Miller saw off a strong challenge from the SNP's Gordon Murray in October 1974, but won the other two general elections in this period easily.
</p><p>
The SNP put up a stronger challenge to Labour's Alex Wilson back in Hamilton, which posed a problem for Labour when Wilson died in 1978.  The resulting Hamilton by-election on 31st May saw three candidates save their deposits.  In third place was the Conservative candidate Alexander Scrymgeour, then known as Lord Scrymgeour, who has sat in the House of Lords since 1983 when he succeeded to the title of Earl of Dundee; with this hereditary title came the hereditary role of Royal Standard Bearer of Scotland, and Dundee fulfilled that role earlier this year at the coronation of Charles III.  In second place was Margo MacDonald, the winner of the 1973 Glasgow Govan by-election and Depute Leader of the SNP, who had run a pub in Blantyre when she was in her twenties.  But this time Labour made no mistake: George Robertson held the 1978 Hamilton by-election with 51% of the vote and a majority of 6,492 over MacDonald.  The 1983 redistribution restored Blantyre to the Hamilton constituency, and Robertson was not seriously challenged thereafter.
</p><p>
Following Rutherglen's annexation by Glasgow in 1975 the Rutherglen seat was renamed in 1983 as "Glasgow Rutherglen", with slightly revised boundaries but still the same MP.  Gregor Mackenzie had turned Rutherglen into a safe Labour seat since winning the 1964 by-election, served as a junior minister in the 1970s Labour governments, and in 1983 he was re-elected for his eighth and final term of office.  Finishing second this year was the Liberal candidate Robert Brown, a solicitor and local councillor who would go on to serve as the Liberal Democrat MSP for Glasgow in 1999-2011; Brown is still in situ here today, serving as a South Lanarkshire councillor for Rutherglen South ward.  At one point he was the only Lib Dem elected representative in the whole of Lanarkshire.
</p><p>
In 1987 Gregor Mackenzie retired after 23 years in the Commons and handed the Glasgow Rutherglen seat over to Labour's Tommy McAvoy, who would also represent the seat for 23 years.  McAvoy was a local man who had been friends at school with the Lisbon Lion Bobby Murdoch, and got into politics as a shop steward at the large Hoover factory in Cambuslang; he started his career in elected office in 1982 by being elected to the Strathclyde Regional Council.  As a local MP he was one of the leaders of the campaign to get Rutherglen back out of Glasgow, which was achieved when Scottish local government was reorganised in 1996.  In Parliament McAvoy spent almost his entire career in the Whips office, and he was a government whip throughout the 13 years of the Blair and Brown governments - a record which is yet to be surpassed.  Politicians of other parties who tried and failed to take on McAvoy over the years include the future UKIP MEP David Campbell Bannerman (who was the Conservative candidate for Glasgow Rutherglen in 1997), the future Scottish Socialist Party MSP Rosie Kane (who also stood here in 1997), and the future SNP MP Anne McLaughlin (in 2001).
</p><p>
While Tommy McAvoy toiled away in the Whips office, the Hamilton MP George Robertson - whose seat was redrawn as Hamilton South in 1997 - was much more prominent in 1990s Labour.  He served from 1993 as shadow Scottish secretary, before being promoted to defence secretary when Labour came to power in 1997.
</p><p>
In August 1999 Robertson hit the world stage by being appointed as Secretary General of NATO, succeeding Javier Solana.  This meant he would have to leave the Commons.  If he had resigned in the usual way, then the by-election could not have been called until the summer recess was ever; Labour, who wanted a quick campaign, got around this problem by elevating Robertson to the peerage as Lord Robertson of Port Ellen, allowing the Speaker to issue a writ under the Recess Elections Act straight away.
</p><p>
The resulting Hamilton South by-election on 4th August 1999 did indeed prove to be a close call.  The Scottish National Party tried to emulate Winnie Ewing's win in the 1967 by-election by selecting her daughter, Annabelle Ewing; the Labour candidate was Bill Tynan, a toolmaker and trade union official who eventually won by just 556 votes.  There were twelve candidates altogether, a record for a Scottish by-election at the time; five of them saved their deposits, including the Scottish Socialist Party (who finished third) and an independent candidate campaigning for change at the top of the local football club Hamilton Academical, who were going through major financial turmoil at the time.  Annabelle Ewing later served as SNP MP for Perth in 2001-05, and is now the MSP for Cowdenbeath.  Bill Tynan made Hamilton South safe again in the 2001 general election, when the SNP candidate was future MSP John Wilson.
</p><p>
The Rutherglen and Hamilton West seat which is polling today was created by boundary changes in 2005; this redistribution reduced the number of seats in Scotland so that constituencies were the same size as those in England, eliminating an over-representation of Scotland which was no longer needed following the establishment of the Scottish Parliament.  The outgoing Glasgow Rutherglen MP Tommy McAvoy took the seat over in 2005 before handing it over to new Labour MP Tom Greatrex in 2010.  Greatrex is an immigrant from England who had worked in a number of advisory and civil service roles before his election.  He was on the Labour frontbench for the whole of Ed Miliband's leadership of the party, including a stint of nearly four years as shadow energy minister; since leaving Parliament Greatrex has put that experience into use as CEO of the Nuclear Industry Association, a role he has held since 2016.
</p><p>
Tom Greatrex was one of the many, many Labour MPs who were swept away by the seachange in Scottish politics following the 2014 independence referendum.  He lost his seat in 2015 to the Scottish National Party's Margaret Ferrier who polled over 30,000 votes to become the first SNP MP, and the first female MP, for Rutherglen.  Ferrier had previously worked as a commercial sales supervisor, and she had contested a February 2013 by-election in Rutherglen South ward of South Lanarkshire council where she finished in third place.
</p><p>
The winner of that council by-election was Labour's Gerard "Ged" Killen, who gained a seat previously held by the SNP and gained an overall majority for Labour on South Lanarkshire council.  Killen and Ferrier faced off again in the 2017 general election in Rutherglen and Hamilton West, and this time it was Killen who was victorious by the narrow margin of 265 votes.  He immediately resigned his seat on South Lanarkshire council, and Labour held the resulting by-election in Rutherglen Central and North ward (<em>Andrew's Previews 2017</em>, page 349).  Round three of Killen v Ferrier took place in December 2019, and this time Margaret Ferrier won by 5,230 votes, recovering her seat for the SNP.  Shares of the vote were 44% for the SNP, 34% for Labour and 15% for the Conservatives.
</p><p>
The old parliamentary boundaries of 1997 live on in a modified form in the Scottish Parliament.  Glasgow Rutherglen (whose name reverted to simply Rutherglen in 2011, but which is still part of the Glasgow region for Holyrood electoral purposes) has had three constituency MSPs in total: former nurse Janis Hughes from 1999 to 2007 for Labour, chartered accountant James Kelly for Labour from 2007 to 2016, and former SNP frontbencher Clare Haughey since 2016.  Haughey and Kelly were the SNP and Labour candidates for Rutherglen at the last Holyrood elections in 2021, with Haughey winning by 50-38.  Hamilton South was represented for Labour by frontbencher Tom McCabe from 1999 to 2011; it was the first result to declare in the 1999 Holyrood elections, meaning that McCabe was the first ever MSP to be elected.  His seat was redrawn as Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse in 2011, and the three Holyrood elections there to date have all returned the SNP's Christina McKelvie, who is currently a junior minister in the Yousaf administration responsible for culture, Europe and international development.  Shares of the vote in Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse two years ago were 46% for the SNP, 34% for Labour and 17% for the Conservatives; unlike Rutherglen, this seat is part of the Central Scotland electoral region.
</p><p>
The local authority here since 1996 has been South Lanarkshire council, which stretches up the Clyde from this Glasgow suburbia all the way south to Beattock Summit.  As previously mentioned, the council is based in Hamilton at the Modernist Architectural Heaven of the Lanark County Buildings; however, the largest settlement in the council area is in fact East Kilbride, while the rural areas south of Lanark look pretty but are sparsely populated.  South Lanarkshire started off as a Labour-run council under Tom McCabe (before his election to Holyrood) and then Eddie McAvoy (Tommy McAvoy's brother), who led the council for 18 years.  In 2017 the SNP became the largest party on the council and took over the leadership; the SNP are still the largest party following the 2022 elections, but the council has a majority for pro-Union parties and Labour are back running a minority administration.  The 2022 results here, conducted using proportional representation, gave 27 SNP councillors, 24 Labour, 7 Conservatives, 3 Lib Dems, 2 independents and a Green councillor.
</p><p>
If we take as a best fit for this constituency the two Rutherglen and two Cambuslang wards, plus Blantyre, plus Hamilton West and Earnock ward, then the 2022 local elections across the Rutherglen and Hamilton West seat gave 39% of the first preferences to the SNP, 34% to Labour, and 11% each to the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives.  With proportional representation in effect, that translated to 9 SNP councillors, 7 Labour and 3 Lib Dems.  Labour carried Blantyre ward, with the SNP topping the poll everywhere else.  The reason why the Lib Dems won three seats and the Conservatives nothing is mostly to do with the Lib Dem vote being very concentrated in the three wards where they won seats, while the Conservatives were quite evenly distributed.
</p><p>
But because this is Scotland we can do a bit better than that, thanks to the tireless work of Ballot Box Scotland's Allan Faulds who has collected the full breakdown of first preferences by <em>polling district</em> from the 2022 Scottish local elections.  Because of the way in which small polling districts were merged to preserve the anonymity of the ballot, it's still not possible to get a completely accurate picture of how the constituency voted; but if we do a better fit by adding in polling districts 135 to 137 and 175 from Hamilton North and East ward, adding polling district 150 from Hamilton South ward and deducting polling district 147 from Hamilton West and Earnock, the above percentages - don't actually change very much, but we can see that the Conservatives polled third across the constituency rather than the Lib Dems, with 10.9% against 10.5%.
</p><p>
The new Labour leadership of South Lanarkshire council has been rather turbulent in its first year and a bit.  In June 2023 the Standards Commission for Scotland, which investigates and imposes sanctions for Scottish Councillors Behaving Badly, suspended the council leader Joe Fagan for two months for leaking confidential information about potential leisure centre closures during the 2021 Holyrood election campaign, while the SNP were running the council.  At the August 2023 full council meeting the SNP attempted to no-confidence Fagan's leadership, but they lost by 34 votes to 21.
</p><p>
In the meantime SNP councillor Ali Salamati resigned from the council, forcing a by-election in East Kilbride West ward which was gained by Labour in July.  In fact, the SNP are still looking for their first by-election win since Humza Yousaf took over as party leader and First Minister; since then the party has had three seats to defend in local by-elections, and lost them all.
</p><p>
And the circumstances of this particular by-election don't look promising for the defending SNP given that this is one from the MPs Behaving Badly file.  On 26th September 2020 Margaret Ferrier noted that she had symptoms of possible COVID-19 and took a diagnostic test, but she decided to keep calm and carry on.  She gave a reading at a church service the following day, travelled by train to London on the 28th and spoke in a Commons debate that evening.  On the same day Ferrier received notification of a positive COVID-19 test, and the following day she took the train back to Scotland rather than isolate in London.
</p><p>
This did not go down well at all with the Parliamentary authorities - "reckless" was the word which Speaker Hoyle used to describe Ferrier's actions - or with the SNP, who suspended the whip from Ferrier and never gave it back.  The SNP's Rutherglen branch called for her resignation.  In January 2021 Margaret Ferrier was arrested by Police Scotland and charged with culpable and reckless conduct; she pleaded guilty to this charge at Glasgow sheriff court in August 2022 and was sentenced to 270 hours of community service.
</p><p>
The Commons standards committee then took a look at the matter, and recommended that Ferrier be suspended from the Commons for 30 days, a sanction which was upheld on appeal.  This triggered a recall petition in June and July 2023, which would vacate Ferrier's seat if signed by 10% of her electors within six weeks.  In the end, the petition was signed by 11,896 out of 81,124 electors - a turnout of 14.7%.  It was enough to force this by-election.  Margaret Ferrier was eligible to seek re-election in this poll, but she has decided not to do so.
</p><p>
The Scottish National Party have a 100% record in defending parliamentary by-elections, although that's only based on one datum point; this is only the second Westminster by-election the SNP have ever had to defend.  Their candidate is Katy Loudon, a former primary school teacher who has been a South Lanarkshire councillor since 2017.  She represents Cambuslang West ward, almost all of which is in this constituency.
</p><p>
Labour have selected another teacher, Michael Shanks, who has a curious if unwanted electoral record to his name: in the 2012 Glasgow council elections Labour stood 45 candidates and won 44 seats, with Shanks being the unlucky one who missed out.  Shanks was also the Labour candidate for Glasgow Kelvin in the 2016 Holyrood election and fought Glasgow North West in the 2017 Westminster election.  At the time of writing, he is the bookies' favourite.
</p><p>
The Conservative candidate is Thomas Kerr, who leads the Conservative group on Glasgow city council.  He represents Shettleston ward, which is on the opposite side of the Clyde from Cambuslang.
</p><p>
Rutherglen and Hamilton West is the only Glasgow or Lanarkshire constituency to have Liberal Democrat local councillors, and the party saved their deposit here in December 2019 with 5.2%.  Their candidate is Gloria Adebo, who fought Rutherglen Central and North ward in the 2022 South Lanarkshire elections; she polled 10.2% and finished sixth out of seven candidates.
</p><p>
Of the other candidates standing this time, one fringe candidate with a local track record is Bill Bonnar of the Scottish Socialist Party, who previously stood in Glasgow Rutherglen in 2001 and in this constituency in 2005.  Independent candidate Garry Cooke, who does most of his tweeting in Gaelic, is calling for Scottish football teams to be allowed to join the English Premier League.  Another independent on the ballot is Rutherglen local Andrew Daly.  The Scottish Green Party have gone for youth in selecting 20-year-old Cameron Eadie, who is a Glasgow University student reading for a masters' degree in social science and public policy.  The only non-Scot on the candidate list is London resident "Prince Ankit Love Emperor of India", which is a step up from a few years ago when Love (who used to lead the One Love Party) was claiming to be Maharajah of Jammu and Kashmir.  The Scottish Family Party, a socially-conservative group which has stood a large number of candidates in Scottish elections in recent years with very few votes to show for it, have selected Hamilton resident Niall Fraser.  Ewan Hoyle is the candidate for the UK branch of Volt, a pan-European party for those who think that Ursula von der Leyen is a bit too Eurosceptic for their tastes.  The Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition have nominated Christopher Sermanni, who lives in Cambuslang.  Retired architect and former Conservative local election candidate David Stark has the nomination of Reform UK.  And last of the 14 candidates on this ballot paper - a record for a Scottish Westminster by-election - is Colette Walker; she is standing for the Independence for Scotland Party, whose manifesto is left as an exercise for the reader.
</p><p>
Whoever wins this by-election shouldn't be too troubled by the forthcoming Westminster boundary changes - unless the result here turns out to be extremely close.  The Scottish Boundary Commission have uncharacteristically decided to reunite Hamilton within a single Westminster seat, which will be called "Hamilton and Clyde Valley".  That seat will take in the Hamilton West part of the present Rutherglen and Hamilton West constituency; to compensate for the loss of Hamilton West, the boundaries of this seat will cross the River Clyde for the first time to take in Bothwell and Uddingston.  This new seat will simply be called "Rutherglen"; another out-of-character decision by the Scottish Boundary Commission, which can go to absurd lengths to avoid having Westminster and Holyrood seats with different boundaries sharing the same name.
</p><p>
Once the count is over, the postmortem will begin - but will it be Labour capitalising on a decline in the SNP's national polling, the Nationalists pulling off a hold in adverse circumstances, or something more surprising?  Well, the good news for election watchers who like to stay up late for the count is that this result should come through quickly.  The South Lanarkshire returning officer has for decades run one of the UK's fastest counting teams, and Rutherglen and Hamilton West regularly returns the first Scottish result on general election night.  In December 2019, the declaration here came at 01:24.  We can expect no messing about this time either.
</p><p>
But while you wait for this Westminster by-election result to come through, there's still time for thoughts to turn to the next one.  First on today's undercard of local by-elections is Tamworth...
