<h2>West Depwade</h2>

Norfolk county council; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Barry Duffin.

This week's other Conservative defence falls in deepest Norfolk.  The West Depwade county division covers 16 parishes in the south of the county, generally to the north of the town of Diss.  None of these parishes are called Depwade: the name is a reference to the long-abolished Depwade Rural District, which itself was named after an ancient Hundred of Norfolk.  The name of Depwade was a reference to an unusually-deep ford, a "deep wade", at Tasburgh which is not part of this division.

The only parish in this division with more than 1,000 electors is Dickleburgh and Rushall.  Dickleburgh lies on the main road from Norwich to Ipswich, about three miles north-east of Diss, and may be best known to outsiders as the home of the TV and radio gardener Bob Flowerdew.  He is an elector in this by-election.  That main road is the successor to a Roman road, which once ran from Colchester to the capital of the Iceni at modern-day Caistor St Edmund.  West Depwade division generally runs west of this road, striking due north from the edge of Diss all the way to Ashwellthorpe, which is closer to Norwich than to the county boundary.

This Norfolk county council division has voted Conservative at all five elections since it took on its current boundaries in 2005.  However, for the 2021 county elections the Conservatives deselected long-serving county councillor Beverley Spratt, who did not take that well: he (yes, Beverley is a he) sought re-election as an independent candidate.  The new Conservative candidate Barry Duffin held the seat with 44% of the vote, Spratt placed second with 24% and Labour came in third with 13%.

The local authority here is South Norfolk council, which is still Conservative-controlled but only just: the South Norfolk council elections last May returned 24 Conservative councillors out of a possible 46.  Four of the five South Norfolk wards covering this county division returned a Conservative councillor in May; the exception was Mulbarton and Stoke Holy Cross, which covers Ashwellthorpe and returned a full slate of Lib Dem councillors.

West Depwade division is part of the very safe Conservative constituency of South Norfolk, which has had only three MPs since 1955 when its then-incumbent Peter Baker gained the dubious distinction of being the last MP to date to be expelled from the House of Commons: you can't argue this wasn't deserved, because Baker had just been sentenced to seven years in prison for fraud and forgery.  Richard Bacon has been the Conservative MP here since 2001.  The South Norfolk seat will be heavily redrawn at the next general election, and much of West Depwade division will be transferred into a completely new seat of Waveney Valley which will straddle the Norfolk-Suffolk border.

Barry Duffin was already due to stand down as district councillor for Forncett ward when he suddenly died in April at the age of 74.  At the inquest into his death, which has been adjourned until October, the Norfolk assistant coroner recounted that he had suffered a brain haemorrhage as a result of a fall at his home.  Duffin had served on South Norfolk council since 2015, and he had been a Norfolk county councillor since 2021.

Defending this seat for the Conservatives is Tony Holden, a former mayor of Wymondham who lost re-election to South Norfolk council in May.  Beverley Spratt wants his seat back and he is standing again as an independent candidate.  The Labour candidate is Pam Reekie, who is a parish councillor in Dickleburgh and Rushall and was an unsuccesful candidate for the ward covering that parish (Beck Vale, Dickleburgh and Scole) in the South Norfolk council election two months ago.  Also standing are South Norfolk councillor Ian Spratt (no relation of Beverley) for the Lib Dems and Catherine Rowett for the Green Party; this division has a short boundary with the Green-majority district of Mid Suffolk, and rumour reaches this column's ears that the Greens may be having a go at this by-election.

<h2>Boleyn; and<br>
Wall End</h2>

Newham council, London; caused respectively by the resignations of Labour councillor Cecilia Welsh and Luke Charters.

Our two Labour defences of the week both take place in the East End of London.  We've come to East Ham, which is now generally considered as Inner London even though it was never part of the old County of London: East Ham remained within the Essex county council area until 1915, when it became a county borough.  The main communication links here run east-west, with the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway and the London Underground District line forming the north boundary of both Boleyn and Wall End wards; the main road here is the Barking Road.

Boleyn and Wall End wards lie either side of East Ham town centre.  Wall End lies to the east, running along the Barking Road up to the borough boundary: once this was the River Roding, now it's the North Circular Road which places East Ham firmly within the current iteration of London's Ultra Low Emission Zone - although relatively few residents here have access to a car in any event.  The eponymous wall here is an embankment which prevented the Roding from flooding the area.  Those parts of the ward which are less prone to flooding were filled with terraced housing around the turn of the 20th century.



Both wards make a number of this column's top 100 census lists.  Wall End ranks 15th for those born in Bulgaria or Romania (10.3%), 29th for those born in Asia or the Middle East (35.4%), 39th for those working in sales or customer service (13.5%, which is the highest figure for any ward in London), 49th for those working in the administration or support sector (9.6%), 55th for Hinduism (17.6%) and 66th for Asian ethnicity (60.1%).  Boleyn ward is only slightly less diverse in demographic terms, ranking 75th for those born in the Middle East or Asia (28.5%) and 87th for Islam (46.0%).

This demographic diversity is not matched by political diversity.  Newham council, which replaced the old county boroughs of East Ham and West Ham in 1965, is the strongest borough for Labour in London local elections.  From 2010 to 2022 the Labour party held the borough's elected mayoralty and all sixty council seats.  The redwash was broken last year when the Green Party won the two seats in Stratford Olympic Park ward, which is brand-new in every possible respect: new buildings, new housing, new residents and new ward boundaries which came in for the 2022 local elections.  Those new boundaries increased the size of the council by six, so the score in the council chamber now stands at 64-2 to Labour.

Boleyn and Wall End both remain safe Labour wards.  Last year Labour led the Conservative slate in Boleyn by 59-18; Wall End gave 49% to the Labour slate, 22% to independent candidate Swarup Choudhury, and 15% to the Conservatives.  The local MP Sir Stephen Timms has represented this area in Parliament since he won the Newham North East by-election in 1994; his current East Ham constituency is seriously oversized with more than 90,000 electors and will be cut down for the next boundary review, but both Boleyn and Wall End wards will be staying put.

These two by-elections both result from Labour councillors standing down after a year's service.  Cecilia Welsh, who was in her first term as councillor for Boleyn ward, is concentrating on caring for her family and particularly looking after her mother, who has increasing care needs.  By contrast, Luke Charters is hoping to advance his career: he has been selected as Labour's prospective parliamentary candidate for the York Outer constituency at the next general election, and he is leaving London to concentrate on his parliamentary campaign in Yorkshire.

Defending Boleyn ward for Labour is Sofia Patel, a party staffer who has previously held roles in health and social care and managed a cinema in the area.  The Conservatives have selected a candidate whose name contains all seven vowels or semivowels: Lawrencia Durojaiye stood in this ward last year, and he is a care worker who commutes here from his home in Barnet.  Also standing are Joe Hudson-Small for the Greens, independent Mehmood Mirza, Daniel Oxley for Reform UK and David Terrar for the Lib Dems.

The defending Labour candidate in Wall End ward is Stephanie Garfield, who works for the NHS and runs a small independent arts business.  The independent candidate from last time is not standing again so his votes are up for grabs: hoping to capitalise on that is the Conservatives' Durai Kannan, a businessman who is active in the local South Indian community.  Also standing are Tassaduq Cheema for the Greens, David Sandground for Reform UK and Claire Pattie for the Lib Dems.
