One by-election on Wednesday 22nd November 2023:

<h2>Talybont-on-Usk</h2>

Powys council, Mid and West Wales; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Anita Cartwright.

Over the last few weeks Andrew's Previews has taken a tour of mid-Wales.  Two weeks ago we were in the Usk valley for a double by-election to Powys council; last week we saw Plaid Cymru hold a Ceredigion council seat in Aberystwyth.  Now, for the final part of this particular trilogy it's back to the Usk valley.

We've come a little further up the valley from Crickhowell, the venue for the last Powys by-election, to reach Talybont-on-Usk.  This is a village of just over 700 souls which lies on the River Usk and on the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal, which opened as far as here in 1799.  It is the eastern of the three communities which make up Talybont-on-Usk ward, which also takes in Llanfrynach not far to the east of Brecon.  The third community within the ward is Glyn Tarell, a valley running south-west from Brecon through which the main road towards Merthyr Tydfil and Cardiff runs.

The economy of this area is based on the surrounding mountains - whether in the form of hill-farming, quarrying or tourism.  Almost all of Talybont-on-Usk ward is within the Bannau Brycheiniog or Brecon Beacons national park, and the ward is centred on the park's highest point.  This is Pen y Fan, whose summit altitude of 886 metres makes it the highest point in the UK south of Snowdonia.  The mountainous terrain here is a test not just for hikers but also for the special forces, who have a base in the Brecon area and use Pen y Fan for selection purposes.  If, within 20 hours, you can march 40 miles with a full pack before ascending and descending Pen y Fan, then maybe you're good enough for the SAS.

On a good day those who reach the summit of Pen y Fan might be rewarded with views of 70 miles or more: north to Cadair Idris and (just about) the Carneddau, south to Exmoor and Lundy Island.  But this doesn't always happen.  Sometimes it never stops raining.  Which is good news for the water board: some of that rain is collected within this ward in the Talybont and Pontsticill Reservoirs, which supply water to Newport and the Valleys respectively.  Next to the latter reservoir is one of the Great Little Trains of Wales: the narrow-gauge Brecon Mountain Railway, along which tourists can commute into the National Park from the south.

Talybont-on-Usk has been a single-member ward of Powys council since 1999.  In 2008 independent councillor Dorothy James stood down after 35 years' service and her seat was gained by Liam Fitzpatrick, who was originally elected on the Liberal Democrat ticket but then went independent for the 2012 and 2017 elections.  Fitzpatrick stood down last year, and the 2022 Powys elections produced a very close four-way result: his seat went to the Lib Dems' Anita Cartwright, who finished in first place with just 28% of the vote.  Second place went to independent candidate Glasnant Morgan, who polled 25%; the Conservatives had 24% and independent candidate Charles de Winton finished fourth and last with 23%.  All four candidates were seperated by just 41 votes, with Cartwright's majority being 19.

Unfortunately, Anita Cartwright has been in poor health since her election: she was granted leave of absence from the council in May 2023, before submitting her resignation in October.  Her resignation statement indicated that, following her experience of cancer, she now wanted to enjoy family life with her young children and pursue her lifelong dream of farming.

In the meantime, there has a major political row in Talybont over the fate of Gilestone Farm.  This farm was recently bought by the Welsh Government with a view to its being leased to the people behind the Green Man music and arts festival, which takes place every summer at Glanusk a little way down the Usk valley from here.  Green Man aren't looking to move their festival out of Glanusk; instead they have plans to diversify, with some smaller events and business ventures planned for Gilestone Farm.  Opponents of the Green Man plan have essentially taken over Talybont-on-Usk community council.  Powys council is run by a Lib Dem-Labour coalition which has been generally supportive of the Green Man plans, so this by-election could be an interesting test of local public opinion.

As mentioned a couple of weeks ago, this ward is within the Brecon and Radnor parliamentary seat which is held by the Conservatives at both Westmister and Senedd level.  Both of those Conservative seats were recent gains from the Liberal Democrats, in the case of the Westminster seat reversing a by-election loss in August 2019.  The Westminster boundary changes redraw this constituency as "Brecon, Radnor and Cwm Tawe", which might make Labour competitive across the seat; but Labour's Breconshire vote is concentrated in Brecon town and Ystradgynlais, and the party is not a factor in this by-election.

Defending for the Liberal Democrats is Raiff Devlin, a young farmer from Brecon: last year he contested the neighbouring ward of Yscir with Honddu Isaf and Llanddew.  His main challenge might well come from independent candidate Liam Fitzpatrick, who as noted above was a councillor for this ward from 2008 to 2022; Fitzpatrick sat in the Powys council cabinet for a time after the 2017 elections before setting up his own independent group.  Another independent candidate on the ballot is David Markinson, who will be hoping for better than the 18 votes he polled in Crickhowell with Cwmdu and Tretower thirteen days ago.  One of the two independent candidates who contested this ward in 2022, chartered surveyor Charles de Winton (who finished fourth), is back for another go; but this time, de Winton has the Conservative nomination.  He completes a ballot paper of four candidates.

<h2>Queen Edith's</h2>

Cambridge council; caused by the resignation of independent councillor Sam Davies.

For our other by-election this week we have come to the southern edge of the city of Cambridge, to a ward name after Queen Edith.  But which one?  Well, back in 1066 this area was owned by Edith the Fair or Edith Swanneck, a very wealthy woman who may have been the wife and was certainly the mistress of King Harold Godwinson; when Harold was killed at the Battle of Hastings, Edith Swanneck identified his body.  But Edith the Fair was not Harold's queen: that title went instead to Ealdgyth or Edith of Mercia, who had no known connection with Cambridge.  Edith of Mercia was a queen of two kingdoms, as she had previously been married to Gruffydd ap Llywelyn, king of Gwynedd and Powys; Gruffydd was the only Welsh king to unite the whole of Wales, an achivement which disd with him in 1063.

One or possibly both of those Ediths gave their name to Queen Edith's Way, a road in southern Cambridge which has borne this name since the 1920s and gave its name to this ward.  Most of the housing in this area lies off either Queen Edith's Way or Hills Road, which runs north towards the city centre.

In the 2021 census, Queen Edith's ward ranked 11th in England and Wales for those working in professional occupations (49.4%), 20th for those working in the health or social work sector (27.1%) and 69th for those working in education (18.8%).  It's also around 24% student.

The reasons for this economic makeup are pretty easy to see on the map.  Off the Hills Road we have one of the constituent colleges of the University of Cambridge.  Homerton College, which moved here from the Homerton district of Hackney in 1881, is one of Cambridge's largest colleges with around 600 undergraduates and 750 postgraduates on its roll; it has traditionally specialised in teacher training.  It is technically the University's newest college, not having been awarded full college status until 2010.  For those who aren't old enough to get to university yet, Queen Edith's ward also has a large number of sixth-form colleges: between them, their enrolment covers more than half of Cambridgeshire's A-level students.

The south-west corner of the ward is one of the UK's largest centres for healthcare and medical research.  Here we find the sprawling site of Addenbrooke's Hospital, the Royal Papworth Hospital, the Rosie maternity hospital and the Cambridge Biomedical Campus.  Many of the major players in medical research have bases here, including AstraZeneca who recently moved their global headquarters to a striking new building on the campus.

Which makes it appropriate that for many years this area was represented in Parliament by the Conservatives' health lead.  Queen Edith's is the the only Cambridge ward which is not covered by the Cambridge parliamentary seat; it's part of the South Cambridgeshire constituency which was represneted from 1997 to 2015 by Andrew Lansley.  Lansley was the shadow health secretary from 2004 until he became full health secretary from 2010 to 2012, a length of tenure which cabinet ministers today can only dream of.  However, his tenure in government is remembered for the controversial Health and Social Care Act 2012.

Andrew Lansley retired to the Lords in 2015 and passed a safe Conservative seat over to Heidi Allen, whose parliamentary career was derailed by Brexit; she was one of the Conservative MPs to join the Independent Group or Change UK or whatever they were called that week.  Allen eventually ended up in the Liberal Democrats before standing down in 2019; her Tory successor Anthony Browne, who was born in this ward, was elected only narrowly against a strong Liberal Democrat challenge.  Browne joined the Conservative frontbench in last week's reshuffle: he is now a junior transport minister, with his portfolio covering aviation, decarbonisation of transport and the future of transport.

The South Cambridgehsire result in December 2019 rather reflects the politics of South Cambridgeshire district, which has a strong Liberal Democrat majority.  Queen Edith's ward is part of the city of Cambridge, which has a Labour majority on the council, but since the Cambridge Tories collapsed in the 1990s this ward has also voted Lib Dem with a couple of exceptions.  Labour won the ward in 2012, but their councillor fell out with the Labour group and resigned a couple of years later; the Lib Dems got the seat back in the resulting by-election. And in 2021, when all three seats for Queen Edith's ward were up on slightly realigned boundaries, independent candidate and local community organiser Sam Davies was elected at the top of the poll with a massive personal vote.  Davies was the first independent candidate to be elected to Cambridge city council for decades.

The Liberal Democrats still hold the other two seats in Queen Edith's ward, topping the poll in May with 38% of the vote against 24% for Labour and 19% for the Conservatives.  That was a good score for the Tories, who campaigned against a proposed and now-dropped citywide congestion charge; the Conservatives went on to win a by-election to the city council in July in King's Hedges ward, very much against the national trend.

Independent councillor Sam Davies is moving out of the city, and she resigned just in time for a by-election to held before her term expires in May 2024.  So whoever wins this by-election will not be able to rest for long.

There is no new independent candidate to succeed Davies, so we have a free-for-all!   The Liberal Democrats may well be best-placed to get back the seat which Davies gained from them in 2021; they have selected Immy Blackburn-Horgan, who works at Addenbrooke's and was a co-founder of the Redcross Areas Residents Association whose area roughly covers this ward.  Labour have reselected Thomas Ron who fought this ward in May; he has recently finished a PhD at York University and is now on the staff of the Cambridge MP Daniel Zeichner.  The Conservative candidate is David Carmona.  Oliver Fisher completes the ballot paper for the Green Party.
