"All the right votes, but not necessarily in the right order"
</blockquote>
</p><p>
Four by-elections in England on 3rd August 2023, with the Conservatives and Labour defending two each.  In a week with something for everyone, let's start with the two Conservative contests:
</p><p>
<h2>Meads</h2>
</p><p>
East Sussex county council; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Barry Taylor.
</p><p>
<blockquote>
Before the Roman came to Rye or out to Severn strode,<br>
The rolling English drunkard made the rolling English road.<br>
A reeling road, a rolling road, that rambles round the shire,<br>
And after him the parson ran, the sexton and the squire;<br>
A merry road, a mazy road, and such as we did tread<br>
The night we went to Birmingham by way of Beachy Head.
</blockquote>
</p><p>
That was G K Chesterton there, anticipating the whole concept of Andrew's Previews in his 1914 poem <em>The Rolling English Road</em>.  The great thing about reading this column is that you even don't need to leave your seat to travel to whatever far-off corner of Britain is on the agenda this week.  Well, this time we're going to take Chesterton almost at his word, and travel to Birmingham - or at least somewhere not far away from there - by way of Beachy Head.
</p><p>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Beachy_Head%2C_East_Sussex%2C_England-2Oct2011_%281%29.jpg" style="max-width:100%">
</p><p>
Yes, it's August so let's do something touristy.  And Beachy Head is an excellent place to start.  This is the point where the South Downs terminate in dramatic chalk cliffs above the English Channel, next to open download countryside.  That countryside is the Eastbourne Downland Estate, and we have the council to thank for it: Eastbourne Borough Council bought Beachy Head in 1929 to preserve it as open space for the benefit of the public.  Since 2010 it has been the eastern end of the South Downs National Park.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/e-sussex-cc-meads.png" alt="E Sussex CC, Meads" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
This purchase was necessary, for the seaside resort town of Eastbourne is just out of shot to the right of the picture.  Eastbourne's southern end is Meads ward, which is generally considered to be one of the smartest parts of the town.  It's also one of the oldest: in the 2021 census Meads was in the top 12 wards in England and Wales for residents aged 85 or over, who make up 8.7% of the ward's population.
</p><p>
That demographic profile might give a clue that in normal circumstances this is a safe Conservative ward in a strongly politically-fought town.  Eastbourne council swung between the Conservatives and the Lib Dems or their predecessors very frequently in the period 1973 to 2007, but then the merry-go-round stopped and the Lib Dems have had a majority on the council since.  In fact, it's quite a strong majority now: the most recent borough elections in May 2023 returned 19 Lib Dems and 8 Conservatives.
</p><p>
Instead this political instability has now transferred to the Eastbourne parliamentary seat, which has very similar boundaries to the borough - in fact, they will be coterminous from the next general election.  This seat has never been quite the same since the Conservative MP Ian Gow was murdered by the IRA in 1990 and the Liberal Democrats gained the resulting by-election; every parliamentary election in Eastbourne since then has turned in a close result between those two parties, although the Lib Dems have only won twice since (in 2010 and 2017).  The last three general elections here have all been contests between Caroline Ansell for the Conservatives and Stephen Lloyd for the Lib Dems; Ansell, the present Eastbourne MP, currently leads 2-1 in the series.
</p><p>
This column covered Caroline Ansell's introduction to elected office in the 31st May 2012 edition of Andrew's Previews, when she was the successful Conservative candidate in an Eastbourne council by-election for Meads ward.  I described her at the time as a "school inspector ... who fought the borough's Hampden Park ward last year [2011]".  On slightly different boundaries to those of today, Ansell defeated the Lib Dems by the large score of 60-16 - not at all out of the ordinary for Meads ward in those days.
</p><p>
A decade on, things have politically got a lot closer in Meads ward.  The Conservative county councillor Barry Taylor was re-elected in May 2021 with a sharply-reduced lead of 46-40 over the Lib Dems, a big swing away from the Conservatives in what was generally a very good year for them.  Eastbourne has admirably simple electoral arrangements, with its nine county council divisions and nine borough wards having exactly the same boundaries so we can make easy comparisons between the two levels of government; and we see that in the Eastbourne borough elections last May the Liberal Democrats topped the poll in Meads ward for the first time.  Shares of the vote three months ago were 41% and one seat for the Liberal Democrats, against 40% and two seats for the Conservatives.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/e-sussex21.png" alt="E Sussex CC, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Not a good omen for the defending Conservatives in what is now a crucial by-election.  In 2021 the Conservatives held control of East Sussex county council with 27 out of 50 seats, which an overall majority of four.  Last week they lost a by-election in Heathfield and Mayfield division to the Green Party, which gives a new composition of 25 Conservatives plus this vacancy against 11 Liberal Democrats, 5 Labour, now 5 Greens and 3 independents.  There is no more margin for error: if the Conservatives lose this seat, then East Sussex county council will fall into No Overall Control and the Tories will have to rely on the casting vote of the council chairman, Conservative councillor Peter Pragnell.
</p><p>
The winner of this by-election will take over from Barry Taylor, who had been the county councillor for Meads since 2005.  He had also represented the area on Eastbourne council for almost 30 years until retiring from that role in May 2023, a month before he passed away.
</p><p>
Defending the Meads by-election for the Conservatives is Nicholas Taylor (no relation of Barry), who is the office manager for the local MP and previous Meads by-election winner Caroline Ansell.  Taylor has previous local government experience as a Brighton and Hove councillor from 2015 to 2019, representing Withdean ward; he was on the Conservative slate for this ward in May and missed out on a seat, while his running-mates higher up the alphabet (and thus higher up the ballot paper) got in.  This time Taylor won't be at the disadvantage of being last on the ballot because the Liberal Democrats have selected Brett Wright, who stood elsewhere in the town (in Ratton ward) at the 2023 Eastbourne council elections.  Also standing are two more candidates who return from May's election, David Mannion for Labour and Claire Martin for the Green Party.

<h2>Freebridge Lynn</h2>
</p><p>
Norfolk county council; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Nick Daubney.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/norfolk-cc-freebridge-lynn.png" alt="Norfolk CC, Freebridge Lynn" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
This week's other Conservative defence looks rather safer on paper.  We've come to the countryside immediately to the north of the town of King's Lynn, running inland from the banks of the Great Ouse and the Wash towards the intriguingly named villages of Grimston and Castle Rising.
</p><p>
Grimston doesn't look as grim from photographs as its name would suggest, although the village has declined a bit from mediaeval times when it was an important pottery centre.  The village's proximity to King's Lynn means that Grimston ware was often made for export, with Scandinavia being a popular important.
</p><p>
Castle Rising sounds like the sort of place you might find in a fantasy novel.  Well, the truth of the place is just as fantastic.  There is indeed a castle here, just as mediaeval as your mind's eye might picture.  Castle Rising Castle was erected by the first Earl of Arundel, William d'Aubigny, in 1138 during that period of civil war in England known as the Anarchy.  Its residents included two former queens of England, Adeliza of Louvain (who married William d'Aubigny after her first husband Henry I died) and the She-Wolf of France herself, Edward II's queen Isabella.  The ruins of Castle Rising Castle have never left the hands of William d'Aubigny's descendants, and the current owner is Greville Howard who we shall come back to in a moment.
</p><p>
However, these old villages are now dwarfed by new development.  The twin villages of North and South Wootton have been the subject of major housebuilding in recent decades, and they are now part of the urban area of King's Lynn.  Some indication of the density of this development can be guessed from the fact that three-quarters of the households in The Woottons ward are detached houses, a figure in the top 60 wards in England and Wales.  Between them the two Woottons had a population of around 6,600 at the time of the 2021 census, with Grimston at just under 2,000 and Castle Rising having a little over 200 souls.
</p><p>
So, obviously, back in the day it was Castle Rising which was a rotten borough entitled to send two MPs to Parliament.  The diarist Samuel Pepys started his parliamentary career as a Tory MP for Castle Rising from 1673 to 1679, while the future Prime Minister Robert Walpole had a brief term as a Whig MP here in 1701-2.  Castle Rising was disenfranchised by the First Reform Act, when its last two MPs were Lord Henry Cholmondeley (later the 3rd Marquess of Cholmondeley) and local squire Fulk Greville Howard who at the time was the owner of what was left of Castle Rising.
</p><p>
Both of them were Tories, as is the current North West Norfolk MP James Wild and Howard's descendant Greville Howard.  Described by the <em>Guardian</em> in 2019 as a multi-millionaire Eurosceptic businessman, Howard's property portfolio also includes a Georgian townhouse on Lord North Street in Westminster from which the Conservative leadership campaigns of Michael Portillo (1995), Iain Duncan Smith (2001), Boris Johnson (2019) and Liz Truss (2022) were all run.  Michael Howard elevated Greville Howard to the Lords as Lord Howard of Rising, and Greville served on the Lords opposition frontbench for a while afterwards while also drawing an allowance as a King's Lynn and West Norfolk councillor.  He was first elected as councillor for the former North Wootton ward in 2003, transferring to The Woottons ward following boundary changes in 2019.
</p><p>
The Woottons, Castle Rising and Grimston are covered by the Freebridge Lynn county council division, whose name recalls a Rural District of Norfolk which was abolished in 1974 and a Hundred of Norfolk which existed until the 19th century.  The current division boundaries date from 2005, and the five ordinary elections here to date have returned five different Conservative councillors (although not Greville Howard).  Apart from the 2013 result, when a strong UKIP showing split the right-wing vote and resulted in a small Conservative majority over the Green Party, Freebridge Lynn division has been safely Conservative: at the last Norfolk county elections in 2021, the Tories had a 65-20 lead over the Greens.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2021/norfolk21.png" alt="Norfolk CC, 2021" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
But, if the 2023 King's Lynn and West Norfolk elections are anything to go by, that Tory lead may be slipping.  The Conservatives lost control of the district council in May, and an independent-led coalition is now running the show.  Two of the ruling independent councillors represent The Woottons ward which covers the majority of this division: they gained their seats from the Conservatives in May, with Lord Howard of Rising losing re-election.  Grimston is part of the Gayton and Grimston ward, where the Green candidate Michael de Whalley topped the poll in both 2019 and 2023; the Tories lost that ward's other seat to an independent in May.
</p><p>
Later that month, the Freebridge Lynn county councillor Nick Daubney passed away at the age of 72.  Daubney had been a major figure in King's Lynn politics for many years, serving as a King's Lynn and West Norfolk district councillor for South Wootton from 1999 to 2019 - including ten years as leader of that council from 2007 to 2017, followed by a mayoral year in 2018-19.  After retiring from the district council in 2019, he worked as a tour guide in King's Lynn and was elected to Norfolk county council in 2021.  He was in his first term on the county council.
</p><p>
So, this may be a tougher defence than the 45-point Conservative lead from two years ago suggests.  The task of holding this seat for the Conservatives has fallen to Olivia Morris, who lives in North Wootton and is chief of staff to the Norfolk Conservative MP Chloe Smith; in 2020 Morris became a school governor at her former primary school in Ashwicken, when she was just 18 years old.  The Green candidate is the aforementioned district councillor (Andrew) Michael de Whalley, an IT specialist and Iraq veteran who has fought this county division at the last four elections; he is part of the ruling coalition on the district council, and he sits on the cabinet there with the portfolio of, logically enough, climate change and biodiversity.  Also standing are Lesley Marriage for Labour and John Crofts for the Lib Dems; at this point I should point out that since May 2021 the Liberal Democrats have gained two county council by-elections in neighbouring King's Lynn, on both occasions coming from nowhere to do so.

<h2>Norcot</h2>
</p><p>
Reading council, Berkshire; caused by the death of Labour councillor Colette Dennis.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/reading-norcot.png" alt="Reading, Norcot" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Our first Labour defence of the week comes from the North Cottage.  Norcot, as it's now known, is a western suburb of Reading which was originally part of the large parish of Tilehurst; appropriately enough, tile-making was the main local industry.  The modern Norcot ward runs from the secondary school of Kings Academy Prospect in a north-easterly direction, downhill to the Oxford Road.
</p><p>
The urban growth of Reading means that Tilehurst is now firmly part of Reading's urban area, but not all of it is part of the Reading borough whose boundaries haven't kept pace with the town's expansion.  The current Reading West parliamentary seat includes all of Tilehurst, which means that a large number of its electors actually reside in the West Berkshire district.  That seat's Conservative MP, the former Cabinet minister Sir Alok Sharma, currently has a rather marginal seat; but the Boundary Commission should come to his rescue at the next general election, because the redrawn Reading West and Mid Berkshire will be focused less on the town and more on the Mid Berkshire countryside.  In December 2019 conditions the new constituency would have been much safer for the Conservatives than the current Reading West.
</p><p>
At local level West Berkshire council is a Conservative/Lib Dem contest, but Reading is rather safely Labour: the borough council has been under Labour leadership, normally with a majority, for all but one year since 1986.  Norcot is part of the Reading borough end of Tilehurst, and it's a safe Labour ward like the borough as a whole.  The current ward boundaries date from 2022, when new Labour candidate Colette Dennis finished in third place to win the last of the three seats available; that meant she had to seek re-election for her second term just a year later, which she successfully did with a 58-18 lead over the Conservatives.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2023/reading23.png" alt="Reading, 2023" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
Before joining the council in 2022 Colette Dennis had been Reading's deputy mayoress in 2017-18 when her husband, Reading councillor Glenn Dennis, was deputy mayor.  Following the 2023 elections Glenn became deputy mayor of Reading again, and Colette was just a few weeks into her second period as deputy mayoress when she suddenly passed away in June, at the early age of 60.
</p><p>
Defending this seat for Labour is Fionnuala "Finn" McGoldrick, who works for the party as a special advisor to the shadow business secretary Jonathan Reynolds.  The Conservatives' Lizzy Sheppard is a student, but despite her young age she already has two election campaigns in Reading under her belt: last year she contested the town's Coley ward.  Also standing are Richard Walkem for the Green Party, Marie French for the Lib Dems, independent candidate Alan Gulliver (who finished fifth here in May with 3.4%) and Jen Bottom of the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition, who hasn't let her blindness stop her from standing in this ward twice before; unfortunately, on both previous occasions her surname has proven to be an accurate indicator of her position in the final results.

<h2>Cradley and Wollescote</h2>
</p><p>
Dudley council, West Midlands; caused by the death of Labour councillor Richard Body.
</p><p>
<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/dudley-cradley-wollescote.png" alt="Dudley, Cradley/Wollescote" style="max-width:100%"/>
</p><p>
I promised you in this column we'd go to somewhere near Birmingham by way of Beachy Head.  We've landed up a few miles west of Birmingham, on the edge of the industrial Black Country.  Cradley (first vowel pronounced as in "cradle") is one of the old villages which are now lost in the Black Country's urban sprawl, running south from the River Stour up to the high point of Hodge Hill, where the housing - and the West Midlands county - stops.  Before the creation of that metropolitan area, the county boundaries here were extremely tangled: Cradley was part of Halesowen parish, but was originally located within Worcestershire whereas Halesowen was a detached part of Shropshire.
</p><p>
The Black Country is known for its industrial tradition, and Cradley's industry was the manufacture of iron chains.  The village is located over coal seams, and the coal which powered the iron forges was local.  Hot metal of a different kind is associated with Cradley's most famous son William Caslon the Elder, who revolutionised British printing in the eighteenth century by designing the typeface which still bears his name today.
</p><p>
This ward was created in 2004 and was originally called "Cradley and Foxcote".  In 2011 Dudley council changed the name of the ward to Cradley and Wollescote, at the same time as the ward next door had its name changed from "Lye and Wollescote" to "Lye and Stourbridge North".  There was no boundary change associated with this, so we can only assume that the Local Government Boundary Commission's opinion of where Wollescote actually is was not shared by the locals.  To be fair, this ward does include Wollescote primary school and half of Wollescote's main recreational area, Stevens Park.
</p><p>
In the fifteen previous Dudley council elections on these boundaries, Cradley and Wollescote has often proven to be a safe Labour ward.  The Conservatives came close on a few occasions but broke through only in 2021, a year when a Tory landslide delivered them 21 out of the 24 wards on Dudley council.  Those 21 seats will be up for re-election next year, so the current council composition of 44 Conservatives, 27 Labour and an independent is not as strong a majority as it looks: a repeat of last year's results in 2024 would see Labour gain nine seats from the Conservatives and result in a hung council.
</p><p>
Also next year we are likely to see the next parliamentary general election.  Cradley and Wollescote ward is presently part of the Stourbridge constituency, which has voted for the government at every election since its re-creation in 1997.  The Black Country is one of the big losers from the boundary changes which will come in for the next Parliament, and one effect of this is that Cradley and Wollescote ward will transfer into another seat with that distinction, Halesowen (renamed from the current Halesowen and Rowley Regis).
</p><p>
So, this is a crucial Labour versus Conservative contest in a crucial Conservative versus Labour parliamentary seat?  Well, perhaps not.  Over the last few years Cradley and Wollescote ward has suddenly turned into a Liberal Democrat hotspot.  The Lib Dems had rarely contested the ward in the 2000s and 2010s and only once finished better than last when they did stand; and when Ryan Priest first stood here in 2019 his result then - fifth and last with 4.5% - fitted into that pattern.  But in the three elections so far this decade the Lib Dem vote for Priest has increased to 10%, then 31%, and three months ago 38%.  Labour councillor Richard Body was re-elected on 4th May with 39% and a majority of just 21 votes, with the Conservatives - who have to defend this ward next year - trailing in third with 19%.  For context, the entire Black Country has been a Lib Dem-free zone since 2021 when the party's last two councillors in Walsall were defeated, and the Liberal Democrats haven't won a ward in Dudley since 2007.
</p><p>
Labour councillor Richard Body then suddenly passed away on 9th May, just five days into his sixth terms of office.  Body was only in his late 50s, and he had served as a councillor here since the ward's creation in 2004.  His highest position on the council was as chair of the taxi licensing committee for six years; within the ward he was known as a campaigner for the local community, taking on all sorts of fitness challenges to raise money despite having had both of his knees replaced.  The day before he died, Body had started a campaign to raise £5,000 for a children's pump track within the ward at Homer Hill Park in Cradley: if you would like to donate to this cause, <a href="https://www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/homer-hill-park?utm_id=106&fbclid=IwAR1b8petxCx4-lRqH2hNWqxU4KymXagfhpiEMTPr3rKAKEQFtUxmB1XulAU">here is the link</a>.  He'll be a hard act to follow.
</p><p>
Defending for Labour is Rachael Gardener, who runs a charity for carers based on Stourbridge.  The Lib Dems' Ryan Priest, a party staffer, is back again fighting the ward for the fifth time after his near-miss in May.  Standing for the Conservatives is local resident Steve Hill.  Two more returning candidates from May complete the ballot paper: they are Kash Khan for the Greens and Siobhan Friel of the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition.
</p><p>
We can't leave this corner of Dudley borough without paying our respects to Stourbridge's most famous current resident.  George has been employed for some years by West Midlands Trains, keeping the pests under control as the resident Senior Mouse Catcher at Stourbridge Junction railway station.  His Twitter account (<a href="https://twitter.com/TheStourbridge">link</a>) comes recommended for a steady supply of photographs, motivational quotes and train running information.  Since this is the internet and there is nothing which cannot be improved by a cat picture, here is an action shot of the Senior Mouse Catcher hard at work in the place where the Government would prefer his human colleagues/slaves to be: outside the ticket office.
