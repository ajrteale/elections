<h4>Cranham</h4>

Havering council, London; caused by the death of councillor Clarence Barrett who was elected for the Upminster and Cranham Residents Association.

One of the reasons I write this column is for quiz revision.  Somestimes it works.  A month ago your columnist was in Edinburgh playing at the quizbowl tournament "Scotbowl", a series of quizzes on <em>University Challenge</em> rules.  Our second game was against a strong team of Edinburgh University students who included the captain of their recent <em>UC</em> winning team, Max Fitz-James.  Going into the final starter question we were twenty points down, meaning that in order to win we needed to pick up the starter and all three bonuses.  This was the starter:

<blockquote>
Which company spun off EOG Resources, which now has a market capitalisation of $57 billion, in 1999?  For six years in a row between 1995 and 2000 Fortune magazine named it as America's Most Innovative Company, and it also won an Ig Nobel Prize for adapting "the mathematical concept of imaginary numbers for use in the business world"-
</blockquote> 
-which was enough for me to buzz in the right answer.  That gave us the following bonuses on 20th-century English composers and hymns:

<blockquote>
1. Which lifelong agnostic was the musical editor of the 1905 <em>English Hymnal</em>?  In it he arranged the folk tunes <em>Dives and Lazarus</em> and the <em>Ploughboy's Dream</em> for the hymns <em>I heard the voice of Jesus</em> and <em>O Little Town of Bethlehem</em> respectively.

2. [The answer to question 1] also commissioned other composers to write hymn tunes, including Gustav Holst, who penned <em>Cranham</em> for which Christina Rosetti Christmas carol?

3. Based on the poem <em>The Brewing of the Soma</em> by the Quaker John Greenleaf Whittier, which hymn claims that God is found "not in the earthquake, wind or fire" but in the "still, small voice of calm"?  It's often set to an aria from the oratorio <em>Judith</em> by Hubert Parry, a teacher of [the answer to question 1].
</blockquote>

Yes, we got all of them and won the game by five points, 200 to 195.
