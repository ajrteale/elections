We have five local by-elections on 26th September 2019.  In contrast to last week's interesting geographical spread, all of this week's polls are in towns to the south of the Severn-Wash line - but with three Tory defences, a Labour seat and a free-for-all there is plenty to look at nonetheless.

<h2>Three Bridges</h2>

West Sussex county council; and

<h2>Tilgate</h2>

Crawley council, West Sussex; both caused by the death of Conservative councillor Charles Petts.

We start south of London in the New Town of Crawley for our first two by-elections: one to the borough council and one to West Sussex county council.  The two cover different areas.

Three Bridges (the bridges referred to cross local streams which flow into the River Mole) lies in the east of Crawley.  Since the 1840s this has been an important railway junction: the Brighton Line runs arrow-straight from north to south, while a branch line to Crawley, Horsham and Portsmouth curves off to the west and another branch used to go east to East Grinstead.  This is still an important railway centre: the main signalling centre for the Brighton Line and the Thameslink routes is here, and Thameslink have a large depot at Three Bridges where their shiny new trains are maintained.

Tilgate, on the other hand, is an area in the south of Crawley.  The name goes back to tax records of the 13th and 14th centuries regarding land owned by William de Yllegate in Worth Forest.  After some industrial use in the Weald iron industry (there was a blast furnace here in the seventeenth century) the woodland became a country estate, ending up in the hands of a London banking family.  Tilgate Park (as the area had become known) was sold in 1939, and after a series of uses (from accommodating Canadian soldiers prior to D-Day to the flotation trials of Donald Campbell's boat <em>Bluebird</em>) ended up in the hands of Crawley council, which has turned it into a public park.

Both of these areas were transformed after the Second World War with the development of Crawley as a New Town.  Tilgate became home to the Thomas Bennett school, named after the chairman of Crawley Urban Development Corporation; this was one of England's first comprehensive schools and at one point in the late 1960s claimed to be the largest secondary school in England.  One of its many pupils at that time was Dawn Primarolo, who later served for 28 years as a Labour MP for Bristol: Baroness Primarolo, as she now is, served as a Treasury minister throughout the Blair administration, was a junior minister under Gordon Brown and then a Deputy Speaker of the Commons during the Coalition years.

Three Bridges developed a little earlier than Tilgate (early rather than late 1950s), and its secondary school - the Hazlewick School - opened in 1952.  This school also gave us two Labour parliamentarians: Laura Moffatt, who was MP for Crawley from 1997 to 2010; and Alex Mayer, a Member of the European Parliament for the Eastern region from 2016 until losing her seat in 2019.  Gareth Southgate, manager of the England men's football team, is also a Hazlewick School former pupil, while the school's former maths teacher Mr Ranganathan has recently forged a new career in comedy and TV presenting.  Three Bridges is a slightly more upmarket area than Tilgate, with its easy connections to central London, Crawley town centre and Gatwick airport resulting in high employment levels.

Tilgate ward's boundaries are almost unchanged since 1983 when Crawley council's boundaries were expanded, but a review cut the ward from three seats to two in 2004 as the population hadn't grown as strongly as in other areas of Crawley.  This coincided with the Conservatives starting to become competitive in what had previously been a safe Labour ward; the Tories broke through in 2007 and since then Labour have only won Tilgate twice, in 2012 and again in 2016.  Both seats were up in May this year when Crawley got a new ward map, although there were no changes to Tilgate ward: the Conservatives beat Labour here in May by 47-36, but much of that Tory lead was down to a personal vote for re-elected councillor Francis Guidera.  Charles Petts defeated the lead Labour candidate, Kiran Khan, by just five votes for the second seat.  There is an interesting situation here on the county council, where the local division (Tilgate and Furnace Green) is safely Conservative; its county councillor is Duncan Crow who leads the party's group on Crawley council.

The Three Bridges county division dates only from May 2017, mostly having been creates from the Northgate and Three Bridges division which had existed from 2009 to 2017.  That area voted Labour in 2013, but the 2017 boundaries removed the Labour-voting Northgate ward and added part of a strongly Conservative ward (Pound Hill South and Worth) and that almost certainly tipped the balance in the Tories' favour.  Shares of the vote in 2017 were 45% for the Conservatives and 40% for Labour.  Most of the district is covered by the Three Bridges ward of Crawley council, which turned in a similar result in May this year.

This by-election won't have any serious effect on West Sussex county council which has a large Conservative majority.  There is however an interesting situation in Crawley which is on a political knife-edge.  Labour overcame adverse ward boundary changes to hold their overall majority on Crawley council in the 2019 election, which resulted in 19 seats for Labour and 17 for the Conservatives.  The district has the same boundaries as the Crawley parliamentary constituency, whose first MP in 1983 was noted Tory rebel Sir Nicholas Soames; at the next general election (whenever it happens) Crawley's current Conservative MP Henry Smith will defend a majority over Labour of 4.9%.

So it's marginals time.  Defending the county seat of Three Bridges for the Conservatives is Brenda Burgess, a Crawley councillor for Three Bridges ward.  Labour have selected Amanda Malik who also stood in that ward in May.  Also standing are David Anderson for the Liberal Democrats, Danielle Kail for the Green Party and frequent Crawley election candidate Arshad Khan for his own Justice Party.

For the Tilgate by-election both the Tories and Labour have selected ethnic minority candidates - not something you see very often in a shire county.  Defending for the Tories is Maureen Mwagale, who founded and runs a charity providing help to women in her native Uganda.  The Labour candidate is Kiran Khan, a self-declared Momentumite, she was the runner-up in this ward in MAy.  Also standing are Derek Hardman for the Green Party, Arshad Khan (again) and the Lib Dems' Angharad Old.

<h2>Sweyne Park and Grange</h2>

Rochford council, Essex; caused by the resignation of Rochford District Residents councillor Toby Mountain.

For our free-for-all this week we travel to southern Essex.  This is an area of towns which are now starting to run into each other thanks to development of housing estates, and it can be difficult to determine where one town ends and the next begins.  Such is the fate of Rayleigh, an old market town to the north-west of Southend-on-Sea and the largest town in the Rochford local government district.  Sweyne Park and Grange is Rayleigh's western ward, running along London Road from the town's railway station (on the Shenfield-Southend line).  This ward has existed since 2016 as a merger of two previous wards, both of which were in the top 80 in England and Wales for the ONE "intermediate" employment classification.  It doesn't include Sweyne Park itself but does cover the school of that name; the Sweyne element refers to Sweyne of Essex, who is recorded in the Domesday Book as being the owner of Rayleigh Castle.  (The castle no longer exists; it had become derelict by the fourteenth century and its stones ended up in other buildings in the town.)

As well as a local government district, Rayleigh anchors a parliamentary constituency which since 2001 has been represented by prominent European Research Group headbanger Mark Francois.  In the selection contest for the Tory nomination in the 2001 general election Francois beat somebody called Boris Johnson - whatever happened to him?  Answers on a postcard please to the usual address.  Rochford council is strongly Conservative but Sweyne Park and Grange is not one of the Tories' better wards: its first election in May 2016 saw the ward's seats split three ways.  Top of the poll on 32.5% was Toby Mountain of the Rochford District Residents; second on 30% was the lead Tory candidate June Lumley, and winning the third seat on 23% was James Newport of the Liberal Democrats.  Newport lost his seat to the Tories in 2018, and Lumley was re-elected in May 2019; shares of the vote were 49% for the Conservatives and 38% for the Liberal Democrats.  June Lumley is also the ward's Tory county councillor, having easily gained the Rayleigh South division from UKIP in the 2017 county elections.

The Rochford District Residents are not defending this by-election so we have an open seat.  The Tories will be hoping to gain a clean swap in this ward with their candidate Danielle Belton.  The Lib Dems have reselected Lisa Newport who stood here in May, and an all-female ballot paper is completed by Jill Waight for the Green Party.
