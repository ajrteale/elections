<h2>North West</h2>

We'll sart in the Greater Manchester borough of Bury with the by-election in <a href="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/i646">Church</a> ward, which when it was formed - many decades ago in the days when Bury was a County Borough - was the town-centre ward and named after the impressive church which overlooks the old Market Place.  No longer; when Bury annexed the suburb of Elton over the river to the west, Church ward was expanded to cover this area; and subsequent boundary reviews removed the town centre.  The modern Church ward is the southern of the two Bury wards west of the Irwell, and definitely the more upmarket; a lot of its housing was developed privately in the 1970s on land previously occupied by the Lancashire Fusiiers' regimental depot.

The Church ward by-election has come about because of the death of Conservative councillor Susan Nuttall at an appallingly early age.  She had served since winning a by-election in November 2012, at which point her husband David Nuttall was the Conservative MP for the local Bury North constituency.  As a committed Eurosceptic David Nuttall - who lost his seat in 2017 - must have been gutted to have missed out on the parliamentary games of the last two-and-a-half years, but he's not standing again and the Tories have put up a new candidate for Bury North against first-term Labour incumbent James Frith.  Nobody I've met has a bad word to say about Frith, and he has an extremely high local profile as the figurehead of the campaign to get Bury FC back playing football in some shape or form; given this he may well have a better chance of re-election than the national picture would suggest.  Bury North may be marginal, but Church ward is safe for the Conservatives - it's one of only two Bury wards to have voted Tory throughout the last fifteen years - and their candidate Dene Vernon is favoured.

The other two Greater Manchester by-elections are Labour defences.  The Pendlebury ward of Salford is based on the Devil's Highway, the A666 from Irlams o' th' Height to Clifton; there's some surprisingly lovely countryside in the Irwell Valley here, and also industry around Clifton Junction and at Agecroft, which has transitioned from a coalmining village to a fast-growing Manchester suburb.  It's safely Labour and should elect Damian Bailey without much trouble; UKIP ran second here in May but aren't standing in this by-election.  This will be the last by-election on the current set of Salford ward boundaries, as new wards will be introduced in May 2020; accordingly whoeever wins will not be resting from the campaign trail for long.  On the othwr side of Manchester is Denton West ward, centred on the Denton Island junction where the M60 and M67 motorways meet.  Denton West is in the Denton and Reddish constituency of Labour's national campaign manager Andrew Gwynne, who used to be a councillor for this ward; it's again safely Labour and should return George Jones to Tameside council.

There has been a glut of by-elections in the city of Liverpool recently, and here are two more.  Picton ward is probably better known to outsiders as Edge Hill.  This was once the western terminus of the world's first intercity railway, and there are still extensive railway yards here.  Also within the Picton ward boundary are the Wavertree Botanic Gardens and the Littlewoods Pools building, a beautiful example of 1930s architecture which has stood derelict for years but is now slated for conversion into a film studio.  Picton ward was in the Liberal Democrat column when they were running Liverpool in the early part of this century, but in May it was 70% Labour with the Greens a distant second.  Further out of the city is Clubmoor ward, a residential area around Queens Drive in Walton, in the north of Liverpool.  Clubmoor is utterly safe for Labour who polled 75% here in May; second place went to the continuing Liberal Party, which in Liverpool is the personality cult of longserving councillor Steve Radford.  For these by-elections don't bet against the defending Labour candidates, Tim Jeeves in Clubmoor and Calvin Smeda in Picton.

Liverpool was a city which made a small fortune off the back of the slave trade back in the day, and one visible reminder of that episode in our history can be found in the Lancashire village of Sunderland Point.  An incongruous collection of Georgian buildings at the mouth of the River Lune, which can only be accessed at low tide due to flooding of the road to the outside world, Sunderland Point is the last resting place of Sambo, who came here from the distant West Indies as servant to a ship's captain and didn't survive in the UK very long.  Sambo's Grave is tidily kept and can be visited - tide permitting - on the windswept shores of Morecambe Bay.  When Sambo died here, Sunderland Point was a bustling port, handling ships which were too big to get up the estuary to Lancaster; the big ships now berth a couple of miles to the north at the port of Heysham, from where passenger ferries depart to the Isle of Man and the other side of the Irish Sea.  Next to the port are the two Heysham nuclear power stations, which supply a large proportion of Lancashire's electricity.  All of these lie within the Overton ward, which covers the villages south of Morecambe and Heysham within the marginal Morecambe and Lunesdale constituency.  Overton's Conservative councillor Michael Smith was elected quite narrowly in May, with a 46-42 lead over Labour; he is standing down due to his failing eyesight, and this column wishes him well for the future.  The defending Tory candidate is Andrew Gardiner, while Tom Porter returns for Labour after his near-miss seven months ago.

<h2>Yorkshire and the Humber</h2>

Moving to the wrong side of the Pennines, we come to three by-elections in the metropolitan boroughs of West Yorkshire.  Two of these are in Kirklees, a sprawling district which runs from Dewsbury through Huddersfield to the spine of the Pennines.  The River Colne runs down from the Pennine escarpment towards Huddersfield through the trendy villages of Marsden and Slaithwaite ("SLA-wit") which anchor the Colne Valley ward.  If you've seen the ITV drama <em>Where the Heart Is</em>, you've seen the area.

There has been a Colne Valley parliamentary seat since 1885, covering the small towns and villages to the west and south of Huddersfield.  It's seen some fantastic battles and famous names over the years: the Independent Labour MP Victor Grayson won a by-election here in 1907, while the first Labour Chancellor Philip Snowden represented the seat from 1922 to 1931.  This seat was another of the surprise Labour gains in 2017, and Labour MP Thelma Walker will defend a majority of 915 votes in a re-match with former Conservative MP Jason McCartney at parliamentary level.  The smaller Colne Valley ward is more complicated: it has been won by all three main parties in the last six years, but currently has a full slate of Labour councillors.  Vote shares in May were 30% for Labour, 26% for the Liberal Democrats and 25% for the Conservatives, who lost a seat they were defending; Labour have selected Duggs Carre to hold the seat against the Lib Dems' Robert Iredale and the Tories' Donna Bellamy, who was a councillor here from 2011 to 2019 and is the only candidate to live in the ward.

At the far end of Kirklees district is Dewsbury, another marginal parliamentary seat which was an against-the-trend Labour gain in 2015; Paula Sheriff increased her majority to 3,321 votes in June 2017.  A large chunk of that Labour majority will have come out of Dewsbury West ward, which is based on Dewsbury Moor and the textile village of Ravensthorpe and is still probably best known for the Shannon Matthews kidnap case in 2008.  Dewsbury West has a large Pakistani Muslim population, a voting bloc which has turned out for the Lib Dems on occasion in the past but is now firmly in the Labour column; in May Labour had 72% of the vote here.  This column will replace Labour councillor Paul Kane, who sadly died not long after handing in his resignation; the party will hope that Eric Firth is elected as Kane's successor.

Our last West Yorkshire by-elecion is in an area which would rather not be part of West Yorkshire at all.  Wetherby is a town on the Great North Road, halfway between London and Edinburgh, and many of the coaching pubs in the town centre are still in business today.  There's a lot of industry in Wetherby, mostly concentrated out of town at the Thorp Arch Trading Estate which is home to the British Library's major bookstore.  The town is part of the safest Conservative seat in West Yorkshire, Elmet and Rothwell, and has voting pattersn to match; Wetherby voted 57% Conservative in May.  The party has selected Linda Richards to hold the seat.

<h2>North East</h2>

<h2>East Midlands</h2>

We now move south to the Midlands, starting in the city of Lincoln.  Labour are defending the Lincoln parliamentary seat in the general election after gaining it from the Tories in 2017 with a majority of 1,538.  The Conservatives, on the other hand, are defending the Witham ward of the city of Lincoln, which is on the southern edge of the city, straddling both banks of the river from which it takes its name.  Witham ward is the only reliable Consrvative ward in Lincoln, and should be safe enough for new candidate Bill Mara.

Further down the River Witham is Boston, where there are two crucial by-elections to Boston council.  Skirbeck ward lies in the south-east of Boston town across both banks of the river, and includes the town's docks.  The Boston district covers a large rural area, and Kirton and Frampton ward is an enormous swathe of fenland some miles to the south and west of the town; Kirton in Holland, on the main road south to Spalding, is the main population centre.  Both of these by-elections are Conservative defences, and if the party loses either of them their majority on Boston council will be gone.  Skircoat split its three seats between UKIP, the Conservatives and Labour in 2015; the UKIP and Labour seats went to independent candidates earlier this year, so the Tories' Martin Howard has work to do to hold off independent candidates Don Jenkins and Sue Ransome.  Kirton and Frampton elected two Conservatives and a UKIPper in 2015, with the UKIP seat being gained by an independent in May; here the major challenge would appear to be between the Tories David Brown and independent Lorraine O'Connor.

Our Leicestershire by-election is for the county council, in the division of Cosby and Countesthorpe.  These are two large villages some miles to the south of Leicester; the division also includes part of the village of Whetstone and its industrial estate, where jet engines have been made since the days of Frank Whittle.  This is a safe Conservative division in the safe Conservative seat of South Leicestershire and should elect the Tories' Lee Phillimore.

We now come to the diaster area of Northamptonshire, whose district councillors are now four years and seven months into a four-year term.  Local government reorganisation is in the works, and as part of that the 2019 Northamptonshire district elections were postponed to 2020; the final reorganisation plan will see those elections cancelled altogether and replaced with elections to two new unitary districts.  However, the general election has thrown a spanner into the works, as the reorganisation order failed to get through Parliament before the dissolution.  The councillors of Northamptonshire must be hoping that the new Parliament will give their plight some early attention.

Three Conservative councillors in the county haven't waited.  Two of these are Anna Sauntson and Pam Whiting, who represented the small shoemaking town of Higham Ferrers.  Sauntson represented Chichele ward, named after the fifteenth-century Archbishop of Canterbury Henry Chichele who was born here; Whiting represented Lancaster ward, named after the Duchy of Lancaster which was a major landowner in the town.  We're in the strongly Tory district of East Northamptonshire here, and the Conservatives won Lancaster ward without a contest at the most recent Northamptonshire elections in May 2015; there was a by-election for the ward's other seat in February 2018 which was an easy Tory hold.  Chichele ward normally elects independent candidate Richard Gell at the top of the poll, with Sauntson winning the other seat for the Conservatives.  Peter Tomas defends Lancaster ward for the Tories, while the lack of an independent candidate will favour Tory candidate Bert Jackson in Chichele ward where he was runner-up in 2011 and 2015.  Both wards are in the Wellingborough parliamentary seat, where arch-Eurosceptic Peter Bone is seeking a fifth term in office.

Things are different to the north-west of Kettering, in the town of Desborough.  This is another small town which was dominated by the shoemaking industry, but it's located in the Kettering district which is much more politically lively than East Northamptonshire.  St Giles is the south-eastern of Desborough's two wards, and looks safe enough for the Tories baed on the 2015 result, but their defending candidate Jim French will have to hold off a very high-profile Labour candidate.  Phil Sawford was first elected to Kettering council in 1977 for the other Desborough ward; he became leader of the council in 1991, and from 1997 to 2005 was the Labour MP for Kettering on two knife-edge majorities.  Sawford lost his seat to the Tories' Philip Hollobone in 2005 and failed to get it back in 2010; Hollobone is seeking a fifth term in Parliament, while Sawford is hoping to resume his local government career at the age of 69.

<h2>West Midlands</h2>

For our first by-election in the West Midlands we are in one of the most marginal constituencies in the country.  In June 2017 Paul Farrelly was declared re-elected as Labour MP for Newcastle-under-Lyme with a majority of just thirty votes amid huge controversy, in one of the most chaotically-run election of recent times.

This column has told the story of the 2017 Newcastle-under-Lyme election in some detail before (Andrew's Previews 2017, pages 374 to 380).  At the root of the problem was the fact that Newcastle-under-Lyme's Electoral Services Officer and her line manager both left the council's employment in 2016, and weren't replaced.  The effect of this was that Newcastle council's team for the 2017 Staffordshire county and general elections was a mixture of consultants, agency workers, temps and secondees, who proceeded though inexperience to make a series of mistakes that - mainly through postal votes not being sent out and late applications to register not being properly processed - left hundreds of electors disenfranchised.  Andrew Scallan of the Association of Electoral Administrators, who produced an independent report into what had gone wrong, put the number of people denied the vote they were entitled to at no less than 998.

The Scallan Report made 16 recommendations, one of which was the self-evident "properly staff the elections office"; and another was "ask Staffordshire Police to investigate the Chief Executive of Newcastle council for breach of official duty", which is an electoral offence.  It would appear that investigation went nowhere, as the Chief Executive John Sellgren was allowed to leave by mutual consent after some months under suspension.  In an indication that nothing succeeds like failure, Sellgren quickly got another job as "executive director, place" of the new Dorset council.

There were political repercussions, too.  The scandal led to the fall of the minority Labour administration on Newcastle-under-Lyme council, as the independent councillors pulled the plug and installed a Conservative minority administration which remains in office to this day.  This adminsitration doesn't include any members from Holditch and Chesterton ward, which covers a former coalmining area just to the north of Newcastle town; this was quite safely Labour in May 2018, but one of the ward's councillors resigned at the start of this year and Labour lost the resulting by-election to an independent candidate.  The other Labour councillor for Holditch and Chesterton has now resigned provoking the second by-election here in nine months; Labour's David Grocott will try to defend the seat from independent candidate Lillian Barker.

While we're on the subject of Newcastle-under-Lyme I can't resist a shoutout to Aaron Bell, who as well as being the Tory candidate for the parliamentary seat is also a far better quizzer than I'll ever be.  Bell was on the St John's College, Oxford team which was runner-up in the 2000-01 series of <em>University Challenge</em>, won the 2009 series of <em>The Krypton Factor</em>, was on the Epicureans team which won the 2010 series of <em>Only Connect</em>, and was runner-up in the Don Valley constituency at the 2017 general election.  Following that last performance, Bell has a very good shot at a winnable constituency this time round.  Labour MP Paul Farrelly, whose re-election in 2017 was so dubious through no fault of his own, is standing down and Carl Greatbatch will attempt to defend the parliamentary seat.

Moving to the other end of Staffordshire, we have two by-elections caused by the death of the Tories' David Greatorex, who sat on both Staffordshire county council and Tamworth council.  His two areas didn't overlap each other: Greatorex' county council seat of Watling South is essentially Tamwoeth south of Watling Street, while his former borough ward of Mercian is Tamworth's north-west corner.  Both areas are safe Conservative and should return Tory candidates Richard Ford to the county council and Steven Pritchard to the district council.

For our final West Midlands by-election we return to Warwick district for a case of Councillors Behaving Badly.  In August 2017 Sukhi Sanghera had been declared bankrupt by Warwick County Court with debts of more than £140,000.  Under the bankruptcy process Sanghera was obliged to disclose all his financial affairs and assets to the Official Receiver.  Sanghera, however, owned a property in Coventry which he had let out for £1,900 per month, and he idiotically tried to conceal this.  The Warwick branch of the Conservative party clearly had the wool successfully pulled over their eyes, because they selected Sanghera as a candidate for the 2019 local elections and he was subsequently elected in Warwick Myton and Heathcote ward.  However, the Official Receiver eventually found out what was going on, and Sanghera paid the price: the Coventry property was sold, raising £70,000 for creditors, and Councillor Sukhi Sanghera was made the subject of a ten-year bankruptcy restrictions order.  As a result of that order he is now disqualified from holding elected office and we are having a by-election.  Myton and Heathcote is Warwick's south-eastern ward and extends to a number of business parks, including the head office of National Grid.  It was safely Conservative in May but having one of your councillors done over by the courts is never a good look, and defending Tory candidate Hugh Foden must be hoping that the electorate will be two distracted by the general election to notice.

<h2>South West</h2>

There is just one by-election in the South West to report, and it's in the city of Exeter.  The Conservatives are defending Topsham, a rather detached town on the east bank of the Exe estuary which was once an important port, but declined with the growth of Exeter further up the river.  Topsham was annexed by Exeter in 1966 and is now one of the city's few Conservative-voting wards.  Most of it is within the East Devon parliamentary seat, where independent county councillor Claire Wright is having another go after finishing as runner-up in the last two general elections; this time Wright is not up against Conservative MP Hugo Swire, who is retiring, but on the other hand Swire was often thought of as having a negative personal vote.  The Topsham by-election won't tell us much about the parliamentary fight, as there is no independent candidate; Keith Sparkes is the defending Tory here.

<h2>Eastern</h2>

Moving to East Anglia where there two by-elections, including a fascinating poll in west Norfolk.  This is our other case this week of Councillors Behaving Badly.  David Pope had been a member of King's Lynn and West Norfolk council for 18 years on the Conservative ticket, but was nominated for re-election this year as an independent candidate.  Now, in order to stand for election you need to get ten electors in the constituency or ward to sign your nomination papers; it's a way of weeding out candidates with very little support.  It turned out that one of the signatures on Pope's nomination papers this year was forged, and the Conservatives' election agent spotted the fraud.  Last month Pope pleaded guilty to permitting a false signature on an election nomination paper before King's Lynn magistrates, who fined him £3,300.  As a result of that conviction, he has een strck off the electoral register and barred from seeking public office again for five years.  Pope had already resigned from King's Lynn and West Norfolk council, jumping before he was pushed.

So we need a successor to Pope in the Upwell and Delph ward.  This is a large swathe of fenland to the north and west of Downham Market, extending across the Great Ouse to Upwell on the Cambridgeshire border.  Pope had topped the poll in May and another independent candidate won the other seat against only Tory opposition.  Longtime readers of <em>Private Eye</em>'s Rotten Boroughs column will recognise the name of the independent candidate hoping to succeed Pope: during the Brown government Terry Hipsey was the Conservative leader of Thurrock council in Essex, but in 2009 he crossed the floor to Labour.  Hipsey was re-elected under his new colours in 2012, but stood down from Thurrock council in 2016 having moved to this corner of Norfolk some years earlier.  He is standing as an independent candidate against the Tories' Vivienne Spikings, who was David Pope's ward colleague here for many years before standing down in May.

Some miles to the west is the Alconbury ward of Huntingdonshire, a collection of nine parishes to the north-west of Huntingdon.  Alconbury lies on the Great North Road (since replaced by a motorway) at the point where it meets the A14 spur; up until this week that was a very important junction on the UK road network, but the opening of the Huntingdon Bypass on Monday this week - a year ahead of schedule - has rather changed traffic patterns in this area.  One major local employer is Huntingdon Life Sciences, the research organisation which was a target of animal rights campaigners in the 1990s and 2000s.  Huntingondshire's last local elections were in 2018 when Alconbury was safely Conservative, and new Tory councillor Ian Gardener should be favoured to hold on.

There are three further pieces of business to report.  Three Aldermen of teh City of London

<blockquote>
And I said to the man who stood at the Gate of the Year:
“Give me a light that I may tread safely into the unknown.”
And he replied: 
</blockquote>

Those words were spoken, perhaps with a hint of a stammer, by King George VI on 25 December 1939 in his second Christmas radio broadcast to what was then the British Empire.  He spoke to a nation at war, looking back on its past, taking heart from the festival of peace which Christmas is, and looking at the future with some trepidation.  We did not know at the time what was to come.

Christmas is a time at the Gate of the Year, a time dominated by traditions.  The nation pausse for a week to celebrate, take stock, meet friends and family, exchange gifts, sing <em>Auld Lang Syne</em>, toast the new year, and bid farewell to the old.

The Romans had a name for the man who stood at the Gate of the Year.  They called him Janus, and named a month of their calendar after him.  Janus was the god of beginnings and endings, doorways and passages, time and transition.  Like your hate politician of choice, he had two faces: one looking forward at the future, one back upon the past.

For ten years now Andrew's Previews has been doing the same thing: looking over the votes of the past, mixing in the present and trying to divine the future.  For seventeen years I've been collecting and publishing local election results in my other pet project, the Local Elections Archive Project.  It's now eighteen years since I first put a cross upon a ballot paper, in the Bury South constituency at the most boring general election of modern times: that of June 2001.



So, what is going to happen in the general election?  The Britain Elects team, in association with the <em>New Statesman</em>, has done its very best to bring you all the information you need, and I'll let you draw your own conclusions from what we've written.  But in the final reckoning, we come back to the poem at the start of this essay, written in 1908 by Minnie Louise Haskins.  This poem is generally known now as <em>The Gate of the Year</em>.  A century on from its composition, shifts in the English language mean that Haskins' original title is now difficult to read in the reassuring tone she had intended.  It was, of course, <em>God Knows</em>.

<blockquote>
And I said to the man who stood at the Gate of the Year:
“Give me a light that I may tread safely into the unknown.”
And he replied: 
“Go out into the darkness and put your hand into the hand of God. 
That shall be to you better than light and safer than a known way.” 
</blockquote>

And with that thought, it is time to close down for the year in the words which have become traditional.  This column will return in time for the first local by-election of 2020, to be held in Galloway on Thursday 23rd January; until then, may I wish you a very merry Christmas, and may your 2020 be an improvement on your 2019.

<em>Andrew Teale</em>
