One by-election on Tuesday 16th July 2019:

<hr/>

<h2>Cyncoed</h2>

Cardiff council, Glamorgan; caused by the death of Liberal Democrat councillor Wendy Congreve who had served since May 2017.

By-elections are traditionally held on Thursdays, but any working day will do; and this is the first of three consecutive weeks where non-Thursday by-elections are in the pipeline.  To start off we're in the capital city of Wales.  Although Cyncoed is within the Cardiff Central constituency this is one of the city's northern wards, mostly developed in the 1950s on the eastern side of the railway line towards Caerphilly and the Rhymney Valley.  The main local feature is the Victorian Roath Park, set around a lake with a lighthouse in it; this lighthouse is not an aid to shipping but a memorial to the ill-fated Scott expedition to the South Pole, which had set off from Cardiff in 1910.

Despite the presence of a significant student population and a campus of Cardiff Metropolitan University, Cyncoed is one of the most affluent electoral divisions in Cardiff with high levels of owner-occupation.  This manifests itself in a low Labour vote; in this century the Liberal Democrats hae instead dominated the representation here.  The Conservatives were in a poor second place but caught up in the 2017 local election; shares of the vote two years ago were 36% each for the Lib Dems and the Conseratives, with the Lib Dems winning two seats and the Tories gaining one.  Labour came in third with 19%.  The Lib Dems used to hold the Cardiff Central parliamentary seat at both Westminster and Assembly level and came close to regaining the Senedd seat from Labour at the last Welsh Assembly election in 2016.

Recent local by-elections have seen some big gains for the Liberal Democrats, who may therefore be confident of holding this marginal seat.  Their defending candidate is Robert Hopkins, who has recently retired from a long career in local government which included heading Cardiff council's school improvement service for some years.  The Conservatives have selected Peter Hudson, who narrowly missed out in the 2017 election in the neighbouring Heath division.  The Labour candidate is Madhu Khanna-Davies, who appears to be a charity shop manager, and the ballot paper is completed by Morgan Rogers for Plaid Cymru.

Six by-elections on Thursday 18th July 2019, and we start with the big one:

<hr/>

<h2>Northumbria Police and Crime Commissioner</h2>

Caused by the resignation of Labour PCC Dame Vera Baird, who has been appointed as Victims Commissioner for England and Wales.  A former Solicitor-General for England and Wales and MP for Redcar from 2001 to 2010, Dame Vera had been the Northumbria Police and Crime Commissioner since the post was establihsed in 2012.

It's time for the biggest single electoral event of 2019, a Police and Crime Commissioner by-election.  And this is a by-election for one of the larger police forces: Northumbria Police's remit extends not just to Northumberland but also to the metropoolitan county of Tyne and Wear.  Over a million people will be eligible to vote in this by-election.

The two counties involved here are exceptionally diverse.  Northumberland is one of most beautiful parts of England and has its own National Park, a very sparsely-populated area covering the Cheviot Hills, the Kielder Forest and Hadrian's Wall.  Built in AD 122 by order of the Emperor Hadrian (history is silent as to whether the Picts paid for it), the Wall marked the northern frontier of the Roman Empire and is a World Heritage Site.  The well-preserved remains of the forts at Housesteads and Vindolanda give some idea of what life was like on the borderlands all those centuries ago; and another perspective is given by the Vindolanda tablets, postcard-like wooden documents with Latin inscriptions written in ink.  One of these, an invitation to a birthday party for Claudia Severa held around AD 100, is the world's oldest surviving writing known to be written by a woman.

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Vindolanda_tablet_291.jpg/1200px-Vindolanda_tablet_291.jpg" />

A few centuries further down the line, we come to the so-called Dark Ages in which Northumbria was one of the major centres of Christianity.  King Edwin of Northumbria converted to the religion in AD 626, and shortly afterwards a group of monks looking for the quieter life settled on the tidal island of Lindisfarne at the invitation of Edwin's successor King Oswald.  The great Christian missionaries St Aidan and St Cuthbert both served as abbot of Lindisfarne, and their exploits were recorded and popularised by another of the great figures of Anglo-Saxon history: St Bede the Venerable.  Described as the most important European scholar of the seventh century, and the only Briton recognised as a Doctor of the Catholic Church, Bede's <em>Ecclesiastical History of the English People</em> is still the major historical source for his time.  This, like all of Bede's many other books, was composed in the dual monastery of Monkwearmouth and Jarrow where he lived virtually all his life.  A museum dedicated to Bede's life and times can be visited on the banks of the Tyne in Jarrow; nearby is a restored version of the 7th-century Jarrow monastery church, which claims to have the world's oldest stained-glass window.  (This claim is slightly misleading: the glass does date from around AD 600, but it was found in excavations and hasn't been in the window for quite that long.)

Northumbria has never really ceased to a borderland.  Lindisfarne Abbey became unviable following Viking raids, which is why Cuthbert's and Bede's remains ended up in the more defensible Durham Cathedral.  Once England and Scotland came into being as coherent entities, Northumbria was in the firing line between them.  The Normans fortified the area by building several castles, including Norham, Bamburgh and a <em>new castle</em> which gave its name to a city.  Many of the great battles between England and Scotland were fought in this area, including the Battle of Flodden at which King James IV of Scotland and many of his noblemen were killed.  The town of Berwick-upon-Tweed changed hands many times between the countries, and its complicated history led to an urban legend that the town was still at war with the Russian Empire after being left out of the Treaty of Paris which concluded the Crimean War.  Berwick is still the major economic and service centre for the old county of Berwickshire, over the border in Scotland, and its football team Berwick Rangers plays in the Scottish league system.

But Berwick and Lindisfarne are not typical of Northumbria as it is today.  There was a lot of coal under south-eastern Northumberland, and the Tyne and Wear estuaries were major centres for shipbuilding and related engineering.  The coal was mined in towns like Ashington and Blyth which form the major conurbation within Northumberland today, while the engineering made the fortunes of Newcastle upon Tyne, its sister town of Gateshead and the city of Sunderland.  And if you fancied a beach holiday, the sandy beaches of Whitley Bay and Bamburgh aren't far away.  Today Newcastle and its twin town of Gateshead are the major urban and cultural centre for north-east England, with all roads and communication links converging on the bridges over the Tyne.  The Port of Tyne is also still busy, with daily overnight car ferries crossing the North Sea to Amsterdam.

The North East of England is a stronghold for the Labour party and has been so for generations.  Labour controls five of the six local government districts covered by Northumbria Police, and fourteen of the sixteen MPs for the area were elected as Labour candidates.

The odd one out in both cases is Northumberland, which since a reorganisation in 2009 has been a single local government district.  Northumberland council last went to the polls in May 2017 and was nearly a senseational gain for the Conservative party, whiich finished one seat and one vote short of an overall majority on the council; the deciding result was in South Blyth division, where the Tories' Daniel Carr tied with outgoing Lib Dem councillor Lesley Rickerby on 356 votes each.  Don't let anybody tell you that you vote never made a difference.  When elections are tied in the UK the returning officer draws lots to decide the winner, and the lot fell on Rickerby who was declared re-elected; that left the Tories on 33 seats out of a possible 67.  The Conservative surge wasn't based on making inroads in the Labour mining towns of south-east Northumberland (with the exception of Cramlington, which is rapidly developing into a Newcastle commuter area); instead it was based on clenning up in the rural areas around Hexham, Alnwick and Berwick where the Lib Dems had previously done wekk.  Berwick-upon-Tweed had a Liberal Democrat MP, Sir Alan Beith, up to 2015; his old constituency now has no Lib Dem councillors.

Northumberland, however, makes up less than a quarter of the electorate here.  Instead the polica area's population is concentrated in the five Tyne and Wear boroughs.  All of these have Labour majorities now, although Newcastle upon Tyne was run by the Lib Dems during the last Labour government and the elected mayoralty for North Tyneside (which covers Wallsend, Whitley Bay and Tynemouth) has been won by the Conservatives a couple of times.  

In the May 2019 Tyne and Wear local elections Labour lost seats in all five boroughs, spectacularly so in Sunderland where their administration has become very unpopular and the party lost twelve of the 24 seats they were defending.  Those losses included the first ever councillors in Tyne and Wear for UKIP which won three seats, and for the Greens who gained Washington South ward by three votes.  It's hard to imagine a more unlikely Green Party area than Washington New Town, but the fact that the previous Labour councillor for the ward had been prosecuted for internet grooming shortly before the election will not have gone down well with the voters.  The Greens also picked up a seat in South Tyneside borough, taking the South Shields town centre ward of Beacon and Bents after several years of trying, and were second in votes across the South Shields constituency on 2nd May.

Also taking place on 2nd May was the inaugural election for the Mayor of the North of Tyne, the latest piece in the government's devlution jigsaw.  These regional mayoral elections have not thus far been happy experiences for Labour, who conspired to lose the West Midlands and Tees Valley posts at the 2017 election; and although Labour's Corbynite candidate Jamie Driscoll did win the North of Tyne mayoralty his performance doesn't impsire confidence.  Across Newcastle, Northumberland and North Tyneside Driscoll led in the first round of counting but only with 34% of the vote, against 25% for the Conservative candidate Charlie Hoult (who was top across Northumberland), 17% for independent candidate John McCabe and 13% for the Lib Dems.  Driscoll and Hoult went through to the runoff, which Driscoll won 56-44.

Vera Baird, in a larger and more Labour-friendly area, never had to go to preferences in her two PCC wins.  The last Police and Crime Commissioner elections were in May 2016 and saw Baird re-elected in the first round with 55% of the vote; best of the rest was 18% for the Conservatives.

Dame Vera is resigning to take up a new job as Victims Commissioner for England and Wales, which means that the provisions for a Police and Crime Commissioner by-election have been activated.  The relevant legislation - the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011 - was written by the Home Office who don't normally have anything to do with elections.  And it shows.  In most cases when a UK elected office falls vacant there is no maximum length of time before an election is held to fill it; the main exceptions are Scottish local government, the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly, which specify a maximum vacancy of three months unless there is an ordinary election within the next six months.  Police and Crime Commissioner vacancies, on the other hand, have to be filled within 35 working days - just seven weeks plus bank holidays for the parties to select and nominate candidates and the election offices of a county (or in this case, more than one county) to organise a poll and a count.  It's a ridiculously short length of time and leads to ridiculous consequences.  On 1st July 2014 the Police and Crime Commissioner for the West Midlands, Bob Jones, unexpectedly died in office; to fit the timescale Birmingham city council had to publish notice of election before Jones' funeral could be held, and the only realistic date for the poll was 21st August when many of the West Midlands' electors were on their summer holidays.  The electorate treated this with the contempt it deserved, and the turnout only just broke 10%.

It should also be pointed out that these are major transferable-vote elections and they need count venues.  These can be difficult to get at short notice.  The biggest count in the European elections just gone was that for Northern Ireland, which as a transferable-vote election really needs a single count venue for the whole province; this year's venue was Magherafelt Leisure Centre, which is centrally-located within Northern Ireland but (with apologies to the people of Magherafelt) rather off the beaten track.  One suspects that the choice of this venue, rather than somewhere more readily accessible in greater Belfast, was motivated by what venues the Chief Electoral Officer could get for a Bank Holiday Monday at short notice.

This is not just Northern Ireland's problem.  Last month it was announced by the Government that the May Day bank holiday for 2020 would be moved from Monday 4th to Friday 8th May to mark the 75th anniversary of VE Day.  To quote from the BBC's report on this, the holiday "will form part of a three-day weekend of commemorative events", and I should know as the military band I play in has been booked for one of them.  The Business Secretary, Greg Clark, was quoted as saying:
<blockquote>
It will ensure as many people as possible have the opportunity to remember and honour our heroes of the Second World War and reflect on the sacrifices of a generation.
</blockquote>

Greg Clark is a politician, and as such it beggars belief that he hadn't clocked that Thursday 7th May 2020 - the day before this specially-moved bank holiday - is ordinary local election day.  Next year we have a lot of major transferable-vote elections coming up: the Mayor of Greater Manchester, the Police and Crime Commissioners, and the London Mayor and Assembly.  The Mayor of London and Assembly election is so big that the 32 London borough councils, who normally run their own counts, aren't trusted with it.  Instead the Greater London returning officer has reserved three of the country's largest exhibition centres - ExCeL, Olympia and Alexandra Palace - for Friday 8th May 2020 as centralised count venues, which will be filled with electronic counting machines that scan your completed ballot papers and produce results for the mayor, the two Assembly ballots and any local by-elections that are taking place in the capital that week.  ExCeL, Olympia and Ally Pally have told the Greater London returning officer that they are fully booked for weeks afterwards; in other words, it's already too late to change the London mayoral election date.  So, rather than having Bank Holiday Friday 8th May 2020 as a VE Day commemoration, it looks like it's going to be dominated by election count news instead; and the returning officers are going to have to budget unexpectedly for staff time at bank holiday rates.  Well done Mr Clark.

That shouldn't be read as a slight on the Northumbria PCC election counters.  This election is being run by the returning officer for Sunderland, whose counting team are traditionally the best in the business but are being given a run for their money these days by Newcastle upon Tyne council.  We can expect no nonsense.  

Defending this election for Labour is Kim McGuinness, who is a Newcastle upon Tyne city councillor for Lemington ward.  McGuinness works for a military charity and is the Newcastle cabinet member for culture, sport and public health.

The Conservatives have selected Robbie Moore, a rural surveyor and Northumberland councillor.  He represents Alnwick division, having gained his seat from the Lib Dems in 2017.

Also standing are Jonathan Wallace, who leads the Lib Dem group on Gateshead council; and independent candidate Georgina Hill who is a Northumberland councillor for Berwick East division and former press officer for the Berwick-upon-Tweed MP Anne-Marie Trevelyan.  In a widely-reported gaffe during the campaign, Hill posed for a photograph outside a deserted "Alnwick Police" station while complaining about staffing levels, not having realised that the "Alnwick Police" station was in fact a set for the forthcoming Sky One TV series <em>The Heist</em>.

With all four candidates being local councillors, whoever wins this by-election there will be another one on the way: you can't be a PCC and local councillor at the same time.  However, <em>that</em> vacancy thankfully won't have any time limit on when the poll can be.

<h2>Llanbadarn Fawr Sulien</h2>

Ceredigion council, Dyfed; caused by the death of Plaid Cymru councillor Paul James at the age of 61.  James was killed in a road accident, while training for a cycle ride to raise money for two hospitals which had treated him for heart trouble.  He had being a Ceredigion councillor since 2004; away from the council James worked in security for Aberystwyth University and had also served in the military.

Back to the normal diet of council by-elections, and we start in mid-Wales.  Llanbadarn Fawr is an eastern suburb of Aberystwyth and essentially part of its built-up area.  As well as being a seaside resort and major centre for the local area, Aberystwyth is a university town; and many of the Aberystwyth University students live on the main campus at Penglais, which spills over into Llanbadarn Fawr Sulien division.

This severely skews the division's census return: in 2011 Llanbadarn Fawr Sulien ranked no 8 in England and Wales for those educated to A-level but no further and was in the top 20 for the 18-29 age bracket, with 65% of the residents being full-time students.  One has to wonder whether holding this by-election out of the University's term (exams finished at the start of June) was a good idea.  Just outside the division boundary is the National Library of Wales, which as one of the UK's legal deposit libraries is entitled to a free copy of <em>Andrew's Previews 2018</em>.

Paul James enjoyed large majorities as a Ceredigion councillor.  At his final re-election in May 2017 he polled a relatively low 71% of the vote, with 15% for the Lib Dems as best of the rest.  Plaid Cymru also hold Ceredigion at Westminster and Senedd level; the Welsh nationalists gained the parliamentary seat from the Lib Dems in June 2017 with a majority of just 104 votes.

Defending for Plaid Cymru is Matthew Woolfall Jones, a former Aberystwyth University student who stood in the 2016 Welsh Assembly election as the party's candidate for the Torfaen constituency in south Wales.  The Lib Dems have selected Michael Chappell, an Aberystwyth town councillor who in the last academic year was chairman of the party's Aberystwyth University branch.  Completing the ballot paper is Richard Layton for Labour.

<h2>Brixworth</h2>

Daventry council, Northamptonshire; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Fabienne Fraser-Allen who had served since 2016.  She had failed to attend any council meetings in the previous six months and was about to be disqalified for non-attendance.

We move to England with what will almost certainly be the last by-election to Daventry council, which is expected to be abolished in April next year.  Brixworth is a large village a few miles to the north of Northampton, bypassed by the main road to Market Harborough.  This is an old village: the parish church, dedicated to All Saints, is our second 7th-century church of the week (after St Paul;s, Jarrow) and is described as "the finest Romanesque church north of the Alps".  In more recent years quarrying of iron ore has been a major industry here, while the main industry here is an interesting one: a Mercedes-Benz plant which supplies engines to the Mercedes, Williams and Racing Point teams.  The Brixworth ward includes six other smaller parishes to the north and west of the village.

Brixworth was profiled in Andrew's Previews in November 2014 when there was a by-election for the larger county division of the same name, following the resignation of county councillor Catherine Boardman to concentrate on her farming business.  I wrote that Boardman had been "credited with turning around the county's poorly-rated children's services", a sentence which has not stood the test of time.  The county's children's services are now effectively in special measures on top of Northamptonshire county council running out of money last year.  Because of that insolvency, local government reorganistion is now in the works which should see Daventry council subsumed into a new "West Northamptonshire" district next year.

That reorganisation meant that the 2019 election to Daventry council was cancelled, so the most recent Brixworth election was in May 2018.  In that year the Tories - for whom this is a safe ward - beat Labour 65-24.  The local county division is also safe for the Conservatives.

The Conservatives have turned to the next generation to hold this by-election: their defending candidate, Daventry resident Lauryn Harrington-Carter, is not yet 20.  Labour have reselected their regular candidate for the ward Stuart Coe, a Brixworth parish councillor, teacher and NUT figure.  Completing the ballot paper is another Brixworth residents, Jonathan Harris, for the Lib Dems.

<h2>Westbury North</h2>

Wiltshire council; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor David Jenkins.

For our second by-election in the English provinces we travel south-west from Northamptonshire to Wiltshire.  Westbury is one of the smaller towns of Wiltshire but for centuries gave its name to a parliamentary seat, originally as a pocket borough; that record lasted until 2010 when the Westbury name was dropped by the Boundary Commission in favour of "South West Wiltshire".  The town's location off the north-west corner of Salisbury Plain means that many transport routes pass through here: Westbury is a major railway junction where the London-Plymouth and Bristol-Salisbury lines intersect.  The North division - one of three covering the town - is relatively recently developed (most of its housing is from the 1980s) and runs generally between the Station Road and the Trowbridge Road.

David Jenkins had represented Westbury North since the modern Wiltshire council was created in 2009.  At his last re-election in 2017 he had a safe seat, defeating the Conservatives 54-32.  Given the swing towards the Liberal Democrats at the recent by-election in Trowbridge, the next town to the north, a hold for the party seems the most likely result.

Defending for the Lib Dems is Carole King, a retired local government worker who fought the Westbury West divsiion at the 2017 election.  The Consevatives have selected Antonio Piazza.  Also standing are Jane Russ for Labour and two independent candidates, Francis Morland (who stood here in 2009) and Ian Cunningham.
