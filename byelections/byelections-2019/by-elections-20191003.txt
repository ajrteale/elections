Six by-elections for seven seats on 3rd October 2019:

<h2>Bridge of Don</h2>

Aberdeen council, Scotland; a double by-election caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Brett Hunt and the death of Scottish National Party councillor Sandy Stuart.  Stuart had served since 2012, Hunt since 2017.

We start this week with a rare by-election for two seats in Scotland - only the third time this has happened since Scottish local elections went over to proportional representation in 2007.  Despite what might appear from the name, Aberdeen refers to a location not at the mouth of the River Dee but at the mouth of the Don, as it quietly flows into the North Sea.  As the city grew, the settlement at the mouth of the Don became known as Old Aberdeen to differentiate it from the city centre area.

A fine granite bridge of five arches was thrown over the River Don in the early nineteenth century, and a suburb grew up on the far side of the bridge - named Bridge of Don after the crossing.  This is the point of entry to Aberdeen for people arriving from the north, and for those who don't want to park in the city centre park and ride buses cross the bridge at frequent intervals.  Bridge of Don has developed into a centre of its own, with a number of business parks for the oil industry within the ward boundary.  The completion earlier this year of the much-delayed Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route has also removed some traffic from the area - the original 1930s bypass of Aberdeen had terminated here.

Since the introduction of PR Bridge of Don has been a single ward electing four members of Aberdeen city council; the ward boundaries were slightly expanded this year.  The Scottish National Party have topped the poll at all three elections to date, but in the inaugural 2007 election they only had one candidate allowing the Liberal Democrats to win two seats; Labour took the other.  Both Lib Dem councillors subsequently left the party and sought re-election as independent candidates; John Reynolds topped the poll in 2012 and was easily re-elected, while Gordon Leslie finished ninth and lost his seat to Sandy Stuart of the SNP.

The May 2017 local elections saw the Conservatives break through across large swathes of Scotland, including in Bridge of Don where they surged from 6% to 26% of the vote in 2017.  The SNP polled 34% and held their two seats, and Reynolds polled 14% and was re-elected meaning that the Tory gain came from Labour.  Labour polled just 11% in the election, although Unionist transfers meant that they weren't that far away from winning the final seat.

This by-election will however represent a stiffer test for Scottish Labour.  Votes at 16 and the Single Transferable Vote apply, and to win one of the two seats candidates will need to poll one-third of the vote - either on first preferences alone, or by attracting transfers from eliminated candidates.  Allan Faulds of the Ballot Box Scotland blog has crunched the numbers (<a href="http://ballotbox.scot/bridge-of-don-aberdeen-by-election-03-10-19">link</a>) and found that had the May 2017 election here been for two seats then the SNP and the Tories would have won one seat each, with Reynolds as a rather distant runner-up.

Unionist tactical votes were also important in the Westminster election of June 2017, in which most of the ward is within the Gordon constituency.  This was one of the twelve Scottish Conservative gains that enabled the May government to continue, and would have been particularly satisfying for the Scottish Tories as the SNP MP they knocked out was Alex Salmond.  At Holyrood level the ward is covered by the Aberdeen Donside constituency; this has been represented by the Mark McDonald since he won a by-election for the SNP in 2013, but McDonald left the party last year following a scandal over his behaviour towards women.  He now sits as an independent MSP.

Aberdeen council has also been the subject of controversy, although of a strictly political nature.  The SNP are the largest party with 17 out of 45 seats on the council (plus two vacant seats), but they are short of a majority and were shut out of power by a coalition agreement between the Tories (10 seats plus one vacancy), Labour (9 seats) and independent councillors (3 seats).  That coalition agreement led to the entire Labour group on Aberdeen council being suspended from the national Labour party, because apparently ideological purity is more important than political power.  It will be noted that the Tory-Aberdeen Labour-Independent coalition has a majority of one, so if the Tories lose their seat in this by-election we could (depending who picks it up) be in minority administration territory.

None of the parties are standing two candidates for the two vacancies, so this by-election will result in a split decision.  Defending the SNP's seat is Jessica Mennie, a PR worker who fought Northfield/Mastrick North ward in the 2017 city elections.  The Tories have a fresh face to defend their seat in the form of local resident Sarah Cross.  Aberdeen Labour have had a candidate imposed on them by the Scottish party: he is Graeme Lawrence, who lost his seat in the neighbouring Dyce/Bucksburn/Danestone ward two years ago.  Also standing are Michal Skoczykloda for the Liberal Democrats, independent candidate Simon McLean (who stood here in 2017 and was eliminated in eighth place with just 91 votes), Philip Clarke for UKIP, Sylvia Hardie for the Scottish Green Party and Max McKay, the first ever election candidate for the Red Party of Scotland.

<h2>Whitchurch and Tongwynlais</h2>

Cardiff council, Glamorgan; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Timothy Davies.  He had served since 2004, with a break in service from 2012 to 2017.

https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/Castle_Coch_from_A470.jpg

Would you like to visit a fairytale castle?  Well, this column doesn't have the budget to bring you Schloss Neuschwanstein, Castelul Bran or that structure in the middle of Disneyland (although <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Andrews-Previews-2018-Andrew-Teale/dp/1999834526">if you buy the <em>Andrew's Previews</em> books</a> that situation might change) but we can offer you Castell Coch.  Nestled on a steep hillside in South Wales, Castell Coch was literally a fantasy: the site is mediaeval, but the building and its interiors are as High Victorian as they come.  Such was the taste of the 3rd Marquess of Bute, who commissioned the buildings we see today in the last quarter of the nineteenth century.  Below the castle was one of the first modern commercial vineyards in Britain (now occupied by a golf course), and the views over Cardiff from the castle are something to behold.  The 5th Marquess of Bute gave Castell Coach to the nation in 1950, and it is now open to the public thanks to Welsh government's heritage agency Cadw.

The location was no accident.  The Butes were one of the richest families in Britain thanks to their involvement in the South Wales coal trade, and a large area of the Cardiff docklands is still called Butetown to this day.  Another rich industrial family whose name is commemorated in an area of Cardiff is the Cory family: Sir Herbert Cory was a Conservative MP for Cardiff from 1913 to 1923, and the Coryton district is named after him.  He should not be confused with Sir Clifford Cory, who had a similar biography but was on the Liberal side of politics (he was the Liberal MP for St Ives in Cornwall from 1906 to 1922 and again in the 1923-24 parliament) and was associated with Barry Docks and the Rhondda.  Sir Clifford's name has been immortalised by one of the best brass bands in the world, the Rhondda-based Cory Band, which won the British Open and European brass band championships this year.  You can hear them here in a recent recording, appropriately playing T J Powell's contest march <em>Castell Coch</em>.

https://youtu.be/RBoneUIzur4

Castell Coch and Coryton can both be found within the same electoral division of Cardiff, Whitchurch and Tongwynlais.  This is a wedge of north-western Cardiff along the A470 road, the main arterial route towards Merthyr and the north.  Whitchurch, a village which has been swallowed up by the growth of Cardiff, is the main component of the division with Tongwynlais being a relatively small village in the velley below Castell Coch.  Coryton railway station, a branch line terminus, connects the area to Cardiff city centre.

Like Bridge of Don, this area elects four members of the city council.  Unlike Bridge of Don, proportional representation is not in effect meaning that small swings can lead to drastic changes in the seat count.  In 2008 the Conservative slate polled 40.5% to 36.5% for Labour, and that 4-point lead gave the Conservatives all four seats.  In 2012 a 5% swing to Labour meant that the Labour slate gained all four seats.  The most recent Welsh local elections were in May 2017, when the Conservatives had 41% here, Labour 38% and Plaid Cymru 14%; and you guessed it, the Conservatives won all four seats.

Despite that, Labour did bounce back five weeks later to gain the local Cardiff North constituency from the Conservatives in the general election after a 7-year Tory interlude.  Labour also hold Cardiff North at Welsh Assembly level, where the local AM since 2011 has been Julie Morgan, widow of the former First Minister Rhodri Morgan.  Mrs Morgan won her seat by defeating another Morgan, the Tories' Jonathan Morgan who represented Cardiff North in the Assembly from 2007 to 2011; Jonathan's mother Linda is one of the Tory councillors for Whitchurch and Tongwynlais.

A marginal electoral division in a marginal constituency overlooked by a fairytale castle - this is the sort of contest this column dreams of.  Watch this one closely.  Defending for the Conservatives is Mia Rees, a "youth policy nerd" according to her Twitter, she works for a local charity.  Tha Labour candidate is Marc Palmer, an estate agent.  Plaid have selected Dan Allsobrook who was on their slate here in 2017.  Also standing are Sian Donne for the Lib Dems and David Griffin for the Green Party.

<h2>Syston West</h2>

Charnwood council, Leicestershire; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Eric Vardy who had served since 2011.

We move to England for the four remaining by-elections of the week.  Syston is a town on the Fosse Way just to the north of Leicester; it's become become part of Leicester's built-up area but is yet to be incorporated into the city proper.  The main local employer is Pukka Pies, which employs around 250 people in Syston and has made its name as a supplier of pies to football stadiums.  According to the company, Rotherham United's supporters eat the most pies, which is a fact that will raise an eyebrow among anybody who has ever had anything do with Wigan Athletic.  Pukka also sponsored the 2009 UK Snooker Championship and gave the winner, Ding Junhui, his body weight in pies; Ding, in a more classy move, donated the pies to a Sheffield homeless charity.

As Syston has not been annexed by Leicester yet, it is for the present two wards of Charnwood council.  Both of these are safely Conservative; in the ordinary elections in May this year West ward gave 51% to the Tory slate, 26% to the Labour slate and 23% to the single Green Party candidate.  The Tories also hold the local county division of Syston Ridgeway, getting a swing in their favour at a by-election in June last year (<em>Andrew's Previews 2018</em>, pages 228-9).  The late councillor Vardy was no relation of the Leicester City star Jamie Vardy, but the big city has left its mark on Syston in other ways: Syston West was 15% Hindu in the 2011 census, a figure in the top 70 wards in England and Wales.

Defending for the Conservatives is Sue Gerrard, a former Charnwood councillor for East Goscote ward who had gained her seat in 2015 from one of the last BNP councillors in local government.  Gerrard had fought Loughborough Hastings (a safe Labour area) in the May 2019 elections, while her old ward of East Goscote went Green.  No, I don't understand it either.  Labour have selected Sharon Brown, who stood in May in the other Syston ward (Syston East) and is a Syston town councillor.  The Greens have reselected Matthew Wise, who stood here in May; and he completes the ballot paper.

<h2>Clacton East</h2>

Essex county council; caused by the resignation of independent county councillor David Sargeant who had served since winning a by-election in March 2016.

All politics is local.  In this time of Brexit (or not, as the case may be), it seems to be <em>de rigeur</em> for the media to send journalists out to some provincial town for a few vox pops to "see what Leave voters think" before said journalists retreat back to their safe space in the London bubble.  That's lazy stuff.  This column makes a point of not labelling wards as "leave" or "remain" in the Previews for various reasons.  First, I'm as sick and tired of the whole thing as you are (and given that I'm supposed to going to eastern Europe next month I've got to sit up and take notice of what's going on); second, referendum voting figures are generally not available at ward level; third, referendum voting figures are by definition a one-dimensional statistic and there is much more varied information out there to use; fourth, and probably most importantly, referendum voting figures tend not to translate into local elections very well.

Don't believe me?  Have a look at Clacton East.  This division of Essex county council was previewed in this column less than four years ago (<em>Andrew's Previews 2016</em>, pages 67 and 68) without mentioning the B-word once.  Alright, that by-election was on 31st March 2016 so it was pre-referendum, but it was after Douglas Carswell had been twice elected as MP for Clacton on the UK Independence Party ticket.  The demographic profile of the Clacton East - the eastern end of the Clacton seafront as you might have guessed from the name, based on Holland-on-Sea and Great Clacton, economically depressed retirement ghettoland - certainly fits the profile of a Leave-voting area.

So, how does it vote at local election time?  Probably not how you expected.  Clacton East's election results were previously dominated by the figure of Pierre Oxley, who polled over 4,000 votes and had a big majority here as the Conservative candidate in 2005 but then broke away to found his own localist party, Tendring First.  Oxley lost his seat to the Conservatives in 2009 but got it back in 2013.

Pierre Oxley was also the chairman of Clacton Sports Club, and in that role he forged invoices to persuade his own council, Sport England and the Big Lottery Fund to pay out grants totalling £95,000 for capital work at the sports club.  This capital work was in fact never carried out, and Oxley instead used the money to meet the club's running costs.  At a trial in early 2016 Oxley pleaded guilty to fraud by false representation and received a two-year suspended prison sentence, which disqualified him from serving as a councillor for five years.  Had he made any personal profit from the fraud, he would probably have done time.

The resulting by-election was won very easily by David Colin Sargeant, standing for the Holland-on-Sea Residents Association.  Sargeant was re-elected in May 2017 as an independent candidate, polling 41% of the vote to 31% for the Conservatives and 15% for UKIP.

This wasn't a flash in the plan.  The Holland-on-Sea Residents Association are a long-established electoral force at the eastern end of Clacton.  In the May 2019 Tendring council elections they were the most successful party within Clacton East, winning Eastcliff and St Bartholomew's wards; the Conservatives won St Paul's ward, while St John's ward (not all of which is within this division) returned two independent candidates, one of whom - Mark Stephenson - had previously been elected on the UKIP ticket in 2015.  Have I persuaded you that politics is more complicated than Leave v Remain yet?

The defending party here is effectively the Holland-on-Sea Residents Association, although they have changed their ballot paper description to "Holland On Sea & Eastcliff Matters".  Their candidate is K T King, one of the Tendring councillors for St Bartholomew's ward.  The Conservatives have reselected Chris Amos who was runner-up here in 2017; he represents Burrsville ward on Tendring council, which is not part of this division.  The UKIP candidate who finished third here in 2017, the aforementioned Mark Stephenson, is also standing again but now as an independent candidate.  Completing the ballot paper are Geoff Ely for Labour, Callum Robertson for the Liberal Democrats and Chris Southall for the Green Party.

<h2>Clarence</h2>

St Albans council, Hertfordshire; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Caroline Brooke who had served since 2018.

We finish in two wards in the south of England with Liberal Democrat strength, in parliamentary constituencies which the party will have their eye on in the cess of an early general election: one due to a Liberal tradition, the other due to marginality.  St Albans is the marginal one, although a Tory majority of nearly 11% in June 2017 still looks a tall order to overturn and the Liberal Democrats have been tilting at this seat for decades without winning.  Mind, the Conservatives did very badly here in May's local elections: they lost eight seats on St Albans council in May's local elections and went from holding half of the seats to second place behind the Lib Dems, who now run the district as a minority.

St Albans' Clarence ward is located east of the city centre and named after Clarence Park.  It has, as I wrote in this column three years ago (<em>Andrew's Previews 2016</me>, pages 256 and 257), the middle-class commuter profile to end all middle-class commuter profiles.  Despite the vagaries of Thameslink over 30% of the population travel to work by train from St Albans City station, most of them presumably going to London.  The 2011 census return put Clarence in the top 25 wards in England and Wales for population with a degree, and in the top 100 for both the ONS higher and lower management employment categories.

With that sort of profile there's only way Clarence ward is voting: Liberal Democrat, and very strongly so.  In May this was one of the safest Lib Dem wards in the country, with a 64-15 lead for the party over their nearest challengers, the Conservatives.  The Lib Dems also hold the local county council seat of St Albans Central, and this is clearly the ward that supplies their majority (the other ward in the division is St Peter's ward, which covers the city centre and has bizarre voting patterns).

Defending for the Lib Dems is Josie Madoc, one of the city's many London commuters and a school campaigner: earlier this year her daughter was told that there were no places available for her in any of the local secondary schools.  The Tories have reselected Don Deepthi who stood here in May.  Also standing are Rebecca Michel for the Green Party and Gary Chambers for Labour.
