There is just one week to go now to the May 2019 ordinary elections, in which 248 councils in England and 11 in Northern Ireland will go to the polls to elect some or all of their councillors.  That doesn't cover the whole of England; London and several English councils sit out this round of elections, and of those is Shropshire; which is why this by-election is being held today.

The Belle Vue division of Shropshire is in the county town of Shrewsbury; this is the south bank of the Severn opposite the town centre, running from the English Bridge along the Belle Vue Road - once the main road to Hereford - through the suburb of Coleham.  The ward was mostly built up by the early twentieth century, although this can be a bad move when the River Severn is having one of its frequent floods.

At local level this is a long-standing Labour area which had been represented by Labour councillor Mansell Williams before and after the reorganisation of 2009 which created the present Shropshire council.  Williams had a large majority over the Conservatives at his final re-election in 2013; he resigned in 2015 and the resuling by-election was held by Labour candidate Amy Liebich very comfortably.  Liebich didn't seek re-election in 2017, and Harry Taylor took over the seat.

Taylor has an interesting biography: he worked in journalism and the car industry before entering politics, and served as Mayor of Coleshill in Warwickshire from 2014 to 2015 before moving to Shrewsbury.  At the 2017 local elections he held the Shropshire council seat of Belle Vue with 43% of the vote, to 28% for the Liberal Democrats who moved into second place and 24% for the Conservatives.  Taylor subsequently became deputy leader of the praish-level Shrewsbury town council and deputy leader of the Labour group on Shropshire council; he combined this with postgraduate study at Liverpool University and writing a biography of Victor Grayson, and at the end of last year he was appointed as deputy regional director for the Labour Party in the West Midlands.

Harry Taylor leaves behind a ward which looks safe enough for the third Belle Bue Labour candidate in four years.  Defending the seat for Labour this time is Kate Halliday, a social worker campaigning on NHS issues.  The Liberal Democrats have selected James McLeod.  Ross George is the Conservative candidate.  Completing the ballot paper are Dave Latham for the Green Party and Bob Oakley for UKIP.

Two elections in the City of London on Tuesday 30th April 2019:

<h2>Bassishaw (Alderman); and<br/>
Cordwainer</h2>

<blockquote>

Two quick notes on City of London elections which are taking place on Tuesday 30th April.  The City of London here is the City of London Corporation, an elected body which is a hangover from mediaeval times and still retains Aldermen.  There is one Alderman for each of the City's 25 wards; they are technically elected for life and as a result aldermanic elections are not synchronised.  The City's electorate is also dominated by business voters, and as such many of its candidates, as can be seen, have prominent business careers.

The current Alderman for Bassishaw ward is Timothy Hailes, a long-standing lawyer.  Hailes was involved in Conservative politics as a student, and while at university he was a sabbatical officer at the King's College, London students' union.  After graduating Hailes became a City solicitor; he has worked since 1999 in the investment banking division of the US bank J P Morgan.  This made him a good choice as Alderman for Bassishaw ward, which is in the north of the City between the Guildhall and the Roman Wall and is home to many financial and investment firms.  The ward also covers most of the Guildhall complex, from which the Corporation is run.  Hailes was elected to the Court of Alderman in 2013 and was Sheriff of London - one of the stepping-stones to the Lord Mayoralty - in 2017-18.  He is the only current Alderman who is openly gay.

Sitting Alderman are expected to seek re-election every six years, and so Hailes is standing for a second term in office.  It's rare for aldermen seeking re-election to be challenged, but we do have a contest here, as Hailes is opposed in a straight fight by Ian Bishop-Laggett.  Bishop-Laggett is the head of Insider Security for the asset management company Schroders and also runs a software company, so he has the contacts to put in a decent performance.  This could be one to watch.

There is also a by-election to the City's Court of Common Council in Cordwainer ward, following the resignation of Sir Mark Boleat.  Sir Mark is retiring after seventeen years on the Corporation; he was knighted in June 2017 for his work as chairman of the Corporation's policy and resources committee and for his career in financial services.  His ward, Cordwainer, takes its name from the former shoemaking trade of that name.  Cordwainer ward runs west from the Bank of England junction along the south side of Poultry and Cheapside; included within its boundaries are the UK's youngest listed building, the postmodernist office black at No 1 Poultry, and the church of St Mary-le-Bow within earshot of whose bells all true Cockneys are born.

The Cordwainer by-election is, like the Bassishaw aldermanic election, a straight fight.  First alphabetically is a name which will be familiar to City election watchers, Timothy Becker; a barrister, Becker came last in this ward with 15 votes in the 2017 City elections, and since then has contested several City by-elections with even worse results.  It's hard to see this record improving considering his opposition: Tracey Graham has made her career in banking and was formerly CEO of an international cash handling company, and also has the contacts required to do well as a member of the Cordwainer Ward Club.
