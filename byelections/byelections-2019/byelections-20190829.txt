Conoisseurs of August by-elections have enjoyed a vintage 2019, with the Brecon and Radnorshire parliamentary by-election poll at the start of this month and this by-election at the end of it.  There can be few more interesting and remote places to go for a by-election than the Shetland islands.

These islands have an old history which isn't all that Sottish.  There are very few trees here, so the islands' buildings have been made in stone for millennia and prehistoric sites are common.  One site, a midden on the south coast of Mainland, has been dated to the fifth millennium BC.  Nearby is Jarlshof, at which buildings dating from the 17th century AD to the middle of the third millennium BC have been excavated.  Many of the Jarlshof remains are Norse, dating from when the archipelago was a Viking colony; Harald Fair Hair, king of Norway, annexed the islands in AD 875.

Things then got complicated from a governance point of view.  According to the sagas, Harald created the title of jarl (earl) of Orkney and Shetland for Rognvald Eysteinsson "the Wise", and he and his successors as jarl ran tha place.  The Vikings gave the name <em>Hjaltland</em> to the place; this was originally transliterated into the Latin alphabet using the letter yogh, as <em>Ȝetland</em>, when then mutated into a Z when the yogh fell out of use.  It's from that Z we get the now-archaic form Zetland for the islands and their postcode abbreviation, ZE.

The jarls of Orkney and Shetland also had extensive holdings on the Scottish mainland, for which they were accountable to the king of Scotland rather than the Norwegian royals, and by the twelfth century the jarls also held the Scottish title of Earl of Caithness.  This was bound to result in trouble sooner or later.  King Sverre Sigurdsson of Norway brought Orkney and Shetland under direct rule following a rebellion in 1194 by the Øyskjeggs (or "Island Beardies").  The last Norse jarl, Jon Haraldsson, was killed in 1231 - sources differ as to whether he foundered in a shiprewck or was murdered in Thurso - and after that the Earls of Caithness were Scottish noblemen and acted accordingly.  This and other issues eventually provoked the Scottish-Norwegian War, whose highlight was a 1263 expedition to Scotland by King Haakon IV of Norway in support of his claims to Shetland, Orkney, the Hebrides and the Isle of Man.  The expedition got nowhere, and after Haakon IV's death in Kirkwall in December 1263 the war eventually petered out with a peace treaty under whose terms the Habrides and Man were ceded to Scotland.  Orkney and Shetland stayed in Norse hands until 1469, when Margaret of Denmark married King James III of Scotland; Margaret's father Christian I, king of Norway, Denmark and Sweden, ended up giving the islands to Scotland in lieu of her dowry.  From 1472 Orkney and Shetland were represented by one MP in the Scottish Parliament - and later the Westminster Parliament - as a constituency whose boundaries have been unchanged ever since.

By this point Shetland had developed into a major trading post.  The Hanseatic League were regularly in Scalloway, at this point the capital of the islands, allowing export of fish, wool and dairy products to the continent.  A new town, Lerwick, was founded as a seaport to trade with the Dutch fishing fleet.  However, the Union of England and Scotland in 1707 meant increased tariffs on those goods, which forced the Hansa traders elsewhere and resulted in an economic depression in Shetland.  The 1840s potato famine hit Shetland hard, and resulted in a relief plan which did increase the population to nearly 32,000 at the 1861 census.  Significant emigration since then means that the islands have never had such a high population since.

The late nineteenth century brought a change in the economy, with the passing of crofting legislation by the Gladstone government to improve the island's agriculture and investment in the local fishing industry by the Dutch.  That maritime focus meant that Shetland lost over 500 men in the First World War, many of them on the Atlantic convoys.  In the Second World War SOE set up a Norwegian naval unit in Scalloway: the resulting "Shetland Bus" made around 200 trips to Norway transporting agents, or for special forces operations.  Leif "Shetlands" Larsen, a Norwegian refugee who did 52 of thuse tours, was the most highly-decorated Allied naval officer of the war.

Today fishing, wool, tourism and agriculture are still major economic sectors in Shetland.  The islands are home to Britain's most northerly veg box scheme.  However, their impact is dwarfed by that of fossil fuels.  The sea between Shetland and Norway is Europe's largest oil field, and Shetland is at the centre of it.  Zetland County Council obtained an Act of Parliament in 1974 allowing it to force the various oil coapanies to build a single terminal to land all this oil; the result was Sullom Voe, which was opened by Elizabeth II in 1981 as the largest oil terminal in Europe.  Sullom Voe is still going strong today, and the taxes on its revenues have made the Shetland Islands Council (whick took over from Zetland County Council in 1975) very wealthy by local goernment standards.

A lot of that wealth goes on communication between the islands.  The vast majority of Shetland's population live on the largest island, aptly called Mainland, which is the fifth-largest of the British Isles by area (only Skye, Lewis with Harris, Ireland and Great Britain are larger). There are however fifteen other inhabited islands in the archipelago, from the isolated Fair Isle and Foula to Bressay over the water from Lerwick, Yell, Fetlar and Unst.  Out Stack, an uninhabited rock off the north coast of Unst, lies at a latitude of nearly 61 degrees north and is the northernmost of the British Isles.  Shetland council sponsors a series of ferries between the islands and air links from Tingwall airport near Lerwick; external flights land and take off from Sumburgh airport at the south end of Mainland, while for those who prefer the slower journey there are overnight ferries to Aberdeen.  There also used to be a ferry link to Bergen in Norway, but this ceased some time ago.

Most of these islnds form the North Isles ward of Shetland council, which returns three of its 22 councillors.  This may be broken up for the next Shetland local elections in 2022 following the passage of the Islands (Scotland) Act 2018, which allowed electoral wards of fewer than three members where islands are concerned.  The Islands (Scotland) Act also provided that official maps which show Shetland and the Scottish mainland now have to show them in the right place, as a reaction to the common practice among mapmakers of putting Shetland in an inset.  So don't do this in future:

The December 2018 electoral register listed 17,670 people eligible to vote in local government and (by extension) Scottish Parliament elections in Shetland.  That will be boosted for this by-election thanks to a Yorkshireman called John Hirst, who in 1979 was senteced to fifteen years' imprisonment after pleading guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility.  Hirst eventually served 25 years in prison thanks to violent behaviour and other offences while inside.  Also while inside he launched a series of legal actions against the prison authorities and other people, culminating in a 2005 European Court of Human Rights ruling - <em>Hirst v United Kingdom (No 2)</em> - that the UK's ban on prisoners voting was incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights.  The Scottish Government, being cognisant of its reponsibilities under human rights law in a way that the UK government is not, has introduced legislation to Holyrood to add prisoners serving sentences of twelve months or less to the Scottish local government electoral register.  That legislation won't get through Holyrood in time for this by-election, so an emergency ministerial order has been made to give prisoners from Shetland who meet those criteria the right to register and to cast postal votes in this by-election only.  There won't be many people this applies to, but they will be the first prisoners in the UK who will get to vote in a public election.

These remote islands have a rather different political culture to the UK mainland.  As stated, Orkney and Shetland have together formed a constituency since the fifteenth century, and since the 1832 Reform Act all but three of its MPs have been Liberals or Liberal Democrats.  The first exception to that was Thomas Balfour, a Conservative who served for two years from 1835 to 1837.  The second was Cathcart Wason, a farmer who had previously been elected three times as an independent mamber of the New Zealand parliament; in 1900 he defeated Liberal MP Leonard Lyell (who had served since 1885) by just 40 votes as a Liberal Unionist candidate.

In 1902 Wason crossed the floor of the Commons to sit with the Liberal opposition (who included among their members his brother Eugene), and resigned in order to seek re-election under his new colours.  The local Liberal association - who had already selected London county councillor Thomas Wood as their PPC - refused to endorse him, so Wason stood as an independent Liberal, while the Liberal Unionists tried to hold their seat by selecting sailor and steamship owner Theodore Angier.  In the by-election on 18th and 19th November Angier only narrowly saved his deposit, with Wason defeating Wood by 47-39, a majority of 211 votes.  Cathcart Wason immediately retook the Liberal whip, and served until 1921.

Wason's successor didn't have as long a tenure.  Sir Malcolm Smith, elected unopposed in the 1921 election, was from a Shetland crofting family but at this point was a businessman based in the port of Leith, and had served fof nine years as the Provost of Leith.  In 1921 he had the Coalition government's coupon, but in the snap general election the following year Smith stood as a National Liberal and lost his seat to the official Liberal candidate, Robert Hamilton, by 625 votes.

Sir Robert Hamilton had made his career in the civil service before entering politics - he had been Chief Justice of the East Africa Protectorate.  He was re-elected in 1923 with an increased majority against opposition from a very young Conservative candidate - Bob Boothy, the future broadcaster and gay rights campaigner who at this point was 23 years old and fighting his first election campaign.  Nobody opposed Sir Robert in the 1924 election.

Following the Liberal split of 1931, Robert Hamilton joined the Samuel side of the split and entered the National Government as a junior minister in the Colonial Office.  He was unopposed in the 1931 Tory landslide, but then left the government and lost his seat in 1935 to the Conservatives' Basil Neven-Spence.

The last Tory MP for Orkney and Shetland, Neven-Spence came from a prominent Shetland family but had made his name as a military physician.  Serving with the Royal Army Medical Corps, he was seconded to the Egyptian army after graduating from Edinburgh University in 1911, and served in the Middle East and Durfur during the First Wold War.  Retiring from the Army in 1927 with the rank of Major, Neven-Spence had contested Orkney and Shetland in 1929 and was vice-convenor of Zetland county council.  He defeated Sir Robert Hamilton in 1935 by the comfortable margin of 2,226.

Neven-Spence was narrowly re-elected in 1945 thanks to a split in the opposition vote.  Labour contested the seat for the first time: their candidate, the wonderfully-named Prophet Smith, came third with 30%, a new Liberal candidate finished second with 34%, and Neven-Spence won with 36% and a majority of 329 votes.  The new Liberal candidate however returned from the 1950 election, and gained the seat easily.

That man was Joseph Grimond, an Old Etonian and barrister who had a long and influential political career.  As a big fish in a small pond, Grimond became leader of the Liberal Party in 1956 (succeeding Clement Davies) and led it through the 1959, 1964 and 1966 general elections and back to repsectability as a significant political force (in votes if not setas).  Jo Grimond was also the party's interim leader in 1976 after the disgrace of his successor, Jeremy Thorpe.  He served as MP for the islands for thirty-three years, rarely being significantly challenged.

Grimond retired to the Lords in 1983, and his old seat was contested by high-profile candidates from the Conservatives and the Scottish National Party.  The SNP candidate was the indefatigable Winnie Ewing, who had been an MP twice before and was the MEP for the Highlands and Islands; she would later reopen the Scottish Parliament as the oldest member of the original Class of 1999.  She finished third behind Tory candidate David Myles, who had been MP for Banffshire since 1979 but whose seat had been abolished by boundary changes.  Myles finished a rather poor second behind the new Liberal candidate, Jim Wallace.

Wallace was an MP in the mould of Grimond and no less influential.  An advocote who had studied law at Cambridge and Edinburgh, Wallace had fought his native Dumfriesshire in the 1979 general election and the South of Scotland in the 1979 European Parliament election.  In 1992 Wallace succeeded Malcolm Bruce as leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, and played a major role in the setting up of the Scottish Parliament in 1999.  Wallace was elected to the new Parliament in that year as MSP for Orkney, and entered the first Scottish Government - a coalition of Labour and the Liberal Democrats - as deputy first minister.  From this position Wallace stepped up twice as acting First Minister, once after the death of Donald Dewar in 2000, the second time a year later after the resignation of Dewar's successor Henry McLeish.  Wallace also had the Justice portfolio from 1999 to 2003, and from 2003 until retiring from the leadership and frontbench in 2005 was the Scottish minister for lifelong leearning.

That retirement from the frontbenches didn't last for long, though.  In 2007 Jim Wallace was translated to the House of Lords and started a new career in Westminster politics.  He served throughout the Coalition years as Advocate-General for Scotland, and from 2013 to 2016 was also leader of the Lib Dem group in the upper house.

Wallace had given up his seat in the Commons in 2001 to concentrate on his dutues in Holyrood, and passed it on without trouble to Alistair Carmichael who has been MP for Orkney and Shetland ever since.  During that time Carmichael was
