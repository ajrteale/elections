Before we start this week, there are some notices to read out from Northamptonshire.  First, an apology is due to the winning Conservative candidate in the Irthlingborough Waterloo by-election last week: his name is not Lee Walker, as I wrote in the preview, but Lee Wilkes.  My apologies to Councillor Wilkes, who goes down in the record books as the first Conservative candidate elected in the Johnson era.



One by-election on 15th August 2019:

<h2>Meole</h2>

Shropshire council; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Nic Laurens.
