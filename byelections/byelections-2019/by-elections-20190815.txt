Before we start this week, there are some notices to read out from Northamptonshire.  First, an apology is due to the winning Conservative candidate in the Irthlingborough Waterloo by-election last week: his name is not Lee Walker, as I wrote in the preview, but Lee Wilkes.  My apologies to Councillor Wilkes, who goes down in the record books as the first Conservative candidate elected in the Johnson era.

I am also grateful to Wellingborough councillor Adam Henley for bringing me up to speed with the latest scheme for the Northamptonshire reorganisation.  Councillor Henley, who is now in the fifth year of his increasingly inaccurately-described four-year term, informs me that the plan now is that there will be shadow elections to the new North Northamptonshire and West Northamptonshire unitary councils in May 2020, while Henley and his fellow Northamptonshire district councillors will have their terms further extended to 2021.  So now you know.  More news as we get it.

Angust is a slow time of year for local by-elections and there is just one poll on 15th August 2019, in Shrewsbury:

<h2>Meole</h2>

Shropshire council; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Nic Laurens.  He had served since winning a by-election in December 2015.

Today our focus is on Shrewsbury, the county town of Shropshire and capital of the beautiful Welsh Marches.  The Meole ward is the first part of Shrewsbury which travllers entering the town along the road from Hereford see; it's based on Meole Brace, an old village which has been absorbed by the town's urban sprawl.  The main local feature is Meole Brace School, the largest secondary school in Shrewsbury; its former pupils include the Burnley and England goalkeeper Joe Hart, who was head boy in his final year at the school and started his foorball career with the local side Shrewsbury Town.  Meole division turned up in the top 15 wards in England and Wales for part-time working in the 2011 census, although there's no obvious reason why this should be.

This is a safely Conservative area.  Nic Laurens was re-elected in 2017 for a full term with a 55-27 margin of Labour; he had first been elected in a December 2015 by-election with 43% of the vote, against 27% for Labour and 20% for the Liberal Democrats.  Laurens was part of the large Conservative majority on Shropshire council.

So the Tories should be confident of holding this by-election.  Their defending candidate is Gwendoline Burgess, who runs the Darwin's caf√© in Shrewsbury town centre.  Labour have selected Darrell Morris, an USDAW rep.  Completing the ballot paper are Lib Dem Adam Fejfer (who also stood here in 2017) and Emma Bullard for the Greens.
