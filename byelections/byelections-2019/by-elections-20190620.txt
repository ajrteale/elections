<h2>Walkden South</h2>

Salford council, Greater Manchester; postponed from 2nd May following the death of Andrew Darlington, who had been nominated as a Conservative candidate.

To start the week on a personal note, I'd like to pay tribute to one of the unsung heroes of psephology.  In 2006 a Tory activitst called Iain Lindley set up a bulletin board on the Internet for discussion of the local elections that year, and once the polls were over ke kept it going.  This evolved into the Vote UK Discussion Forum, which is still going strong today as a place for followers of politics both amateur and professional to hang out and discuss elections and whatever else takes our fancy.  Your columnist has been a member or lurker since the very earliest days and still contributes regularly to the "Pretty Maps" thread.  Because he established Vote UK, I owe all sorts of debts to Iain Lindley which can never adequately be repaid.

While all this was going on, Iain Lindley was a Salford councillor; he was elected in 2004 as a member for Walkden South ward as top of the Conservative slate.  An impressive achievement.  Just outside the congested M60 motorway, Walkden is a classic mining and textile centre which has become a dormitory town for the big city; the A580 East Lancashire road, the Atherton railway line and the misguided bus all link Walkden to Salford and that place beyond.  The South ward of Walkden, south of the A6 road and including the town's railway station, is a lot more upmarket than the North ward or (shudder) Lickle Hulton, and parts of it resemble leafy Worsley.  Something helped by the Royal Mail who have been exceptionally helpful to Salford's estate agents: the Post Office don't recognise Walkden as a town and the whole place has "Worsley, Manchester" addresses.

The present Walkden South ward dates from 2004, and this is likely to be its last election as the Boundary Commission are working on a new map for Salford to come in at the 2020 election.  In 2004 Walkden South was close three ways, with one Labour councillor and two Conservatives elected.  The Lib Dems, who had been a close third in 2004, then fell away very quickly and Walkden South turned into possibly the only classic marginal ward in Salford.  The Conservatives convincingly gained the Labour seat in 2008, but Labour got it back in 2012 (by a majority of 55 votes) and gained a second seat in 2018, defeating the Conservatives by 51% to 40%.  Laura Edwards, the Labour candidate who won Walkden South that year, was just 19 years old at the time and became the youngest-ever Salford councillor.

That suggests an uphill task for the Tories in holding this seat, a defence which will be made more difficult by the fact that Iain Lindley is retiring after fifteen years' service.  He had been the parliamentary candidate for the local seat of Worsley and Eccles South in 2015 and 2017, and his results in 2011 and 2015 suggest he had developed a personal vote.  To replace Lindley the Conservatives had selected Andrew Darlington, a 68-year-old who had had several goes at unwinnable Salford wards in the past.  We'll never know what sort of a councillor he would have made.

The second replacement Conservative candidate is David Cawdrey.  Labour have selected Joshua Brooks.  Also standing are Thomas Dylan for the Green Party, John-Paul Atley for the Liberal Democrats and Tony Green for UKIP.

<h2>Farington West</h2>

South Ribble council, Lancashire; postponed from 2nd May following the death of outgoing Conservative councillor Graham Walton, who had been nominated for re-election.  He was first elected in 2011.

For our second by-election in Lancashire past and present, let's recall a name which will have resonance for people who are older than your columnist: British Leyland.  An engineering conglomerate which was nationalised in 1975 by the secong Wilson governemnt, British Leyland at its peak supplied 40 per cent of the UK car market but also had significant interests in commercial vehicles.

That interest started off in 1896, with the founding of the Lancashire Steam Motor Company in Leyland to manufacture steam-powered vehicles.  They quickly diversified into petrol engines, a move which was marked by a change of name to Leyland Motors.  The company grew quickly in the 1960s and ultimately over-extended itself, with financial difficulties which led to the nationalisation and the new name "British Leyland".  The new government owners eventually sold off the various bits, with the company's truck division merging with the Dutch company DAF Trucks to form Leyland DAF.  Leyland DAF went bust in the 1990s recession, but the British truck division survived thanks to a management buy-out and is still trading today.  Now a subsidiary of the American truck manufacturer Paccar, Leyland Trucks makes around 14,000 lorries every year for the British and European markets.

Those trucks are assembled in the Farington West of the South Ribble district.  This is a ward of utterly flat land between Leyland and the Preston suburb of Lostck Hall, and as a consequence is rather diffuse; parts of both Leyland and Lostock Hall are included in Farington West ward, together with the village of Farington Moss.  The West Coast Main Line forms much of the eastern boundary, and there is a memorial here to mark the midpoint of the route between London and Glasgow.

Farington West has returned Conservative councillors since 2007 when the Lib Dem vote in South Ribble district fell apart.  In 2015, on slightly revised boundaries, the Conservatives had 52% of the vote to 35% for Labour.  However, this is another of the districts where the Conservatives lost an overall majority in the May 2019 local elections; the party lost six seats in South Ribble putting them on 21, against 22 for Labour, five Lib Dems and the two vacant seats in this ward.  Labour have formed a minority administration with the support of the Liberal Democrats, and that should withstand this final result even if the Conservatives hold both seats and become the largest party.  At other levels of government Farington West is within safely-Conserative electoral units; the party polled 68% in the Moss Side and Farington division of Lancashire county council two years ago, while some bizarre boundaries mean that this is not part of the South Ribble seat (which covers Leyland and Penwortham) but is instead included in the sprawling Ribble Valley constituency, which Nigel Evans holds in the Conservative interest.

Graham Walton's ward colleague was his wife (now widow) Karen, and she is seeking re-election for a second term along with replacement Tory candidate Steven Thurlbourn.  Thurlbourn had contested the Labour-held Seven Stars ward in May, but this should be a better prospect for him.  The Labour slate is Emma Buchanan and Ryan Hamilton.  Completing the ballot paper are the Lib Dem slate of Judith Davidson and Alison Hesketh-Holt.

<h2>Pelenna</h2>

Neath Port Talbot council, Glamorgan; caused by the death of independent councillor Martin Ellis who had served since 2012.

<blockquote>
"Pontrhydyfen is, stick for stick and stone for stone, blade of grass for blade of grass, virtually the same, exactly as it was when I was a child."
</blockquote>

For our Welsh by-election this week we are in a particularly remote part of the South Wales Valleys.  The short River Pelenna rises in the hills to the east of Neath, flowing south-west through Tonmawr to a confluence with the River Afan at the village of Pontrhydyfen.  This is an area of hillsides and woodlands which belie a coalmining past, and as with many coalmining areas the local list of famous sons and daughters is dominated by figures from the entertainment industry.  The opera singer Rebecca Evans and the actor and singer Ivor Emmanual (Private Owen in <em>Zulu</em>) were both born in Pontrhydyfen, as was one of the most famous actors of all time: Richard Jenkins junior, born here in 1925, later became known the world over under the name of Richard Burton and supplied the quote at the top of this paragraph.  His Appreciation Society is based in Pontrhydyfen.

In 1925 Pontrhydyfen was unusual for South Wales in being a strongly Welsh-speaking area; the census taken six years later found that 85% of the village's population spoke Welsh.  Knowledge of the language is still relatively high today, reflecting the remote nature of the ward.  Pelenna division makes the top 90 wards in England and Wales for population born in the UK.

Now, don't let anybody tell you that your vote never changed anything.  Martin Ellis had been independent councillor for Pelenna since 2012, taking over after Labour councillor Lance Whiteley retired; he was elected in 2012 with a narrow majority of 25 votes over Plaid Cymru candidate Jeremy Hurley.  The 2017 election here, however, turned up with four strong candidates.  Ellis polled just 133 votes, but that was enough to be re-elected by one vote as Plaid Cymru's Hywel Miles finished on 132.  Independent candidate Peter Hughes had 114, while Andrew Jones of Labour came in last with a respectable 90 votes.  In terms of vote shares, Ellis and Plaid had 28% each, Hughes had 24% and Labour 19%.

Surely this by-election can't be that close; but then again it's difficult to pick a winner from the candidate list.  There are two independent candidates vying to succeed Ellis, Peter Hughes (who was third here in 2017) and Jeremy Hurley (who was runner-up as the Plaid Cymru candidate in 2012).  Hurley gives an address in Tonmawr, Hughes some distance away in Maesteg.  Plaid Cymru's Hywel Miles is also back looking for the one extra vote he needs to win, and Labour's Andrew Jones also returns to the fray.  Very unusually for a local by-election there is no Conservative candidate, so Frank Little of the Lib Dems completes the Pelenna ballot paper.
