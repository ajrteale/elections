Isles of Scilly council; caused by the rsignation of independent councillor Ted Moulson.

<blockquote>
We'll rant and we'll roar, like true British sailors,
We'll rant and we'll roar across the salt seas;
Until we strike soundings in the Channel of old England,
From Ushant to Scilly 'tis thirty-five leagues.

It's time to go outside this column's comfort zone of Great Britain and talk about politics over the seas.  Welcome to the second-biggest democratic festival of 2019, only the Indian general election being larger in electorate terms.  The ninth European Parliament election takes place this week, staggered over four days across the twenty-eight member states of the European Union.  The Netherlands and the UK kick things off today; the Republic of Ireland will poll tomorrow; Saturday is polling day in Latvia, Malta, Slovakia and certain French overseas territories; the Czech Republic will hold two days of voting on Friday and Saturday; and the rest of the continent will take to the polling stations on Sunday.  Hundreds of millions of people will be eligible to vote, and their efforts will return 751 members of the European Parliament.  Delegations range from six MEPs for the smallest EU member states, to 96 for the largest (Germany).

The UK and Gibraltar, for the moment, gets 73 of these MEPs in an election which has been hastily put together at the last possible moment.  And it shows.  This is not to mean any disrespect to those hard-working returning officers and administrators who have toiled hard to put this on for your benefit and will do their usual fantastic job; instead the disrespect is aimed at those politicians (on both sides of the Remain-Leave divide) whose failure to reach agreement means that these elections are going ahead in such a rushed fashion.  It could have been different.  A 29-page statutory instrument was published earlier this year to wipe all references to European Parliament elections off the UK statute book; but it doesn't come into effect until the UK has left the EU and so is (for the moment) wasted effort.

Not the first time an EU election has been controversial in the UK Parliament.  The Act which brought in proportional representation for the 1999 election was one of only seven pieces of legislation ever passed under the Parliament Acts, in which the Commons overrode the Lords' objections.  That 1999 election introduced the system of twelve regional constituencies whose boundaries remain unmodified today.  The UK's delegation of MEPs has shrunk over the years as a result of EU enlargement, but this has been achieved simply by changing the number of seats elected by each region rather than by having a disruptive boundary review.  The North East and Northern Ireland are the smallest constituencies, electing three MEPs each; the South East is the largest, with ten seats up for election.

The 1999 election was also marked by low voter turnout which rather worried the Labour government of the day.  Its response for the following election in 2004 was to improve turnout by delaying the local elections to June so that they took place on Euro-election day, and also to introduce all-postal voting in several English regions in a pilot scheme that was not repeated.  The 2009 and 2014 local elections were also delayed to coincide with European Parliament elections, but this year's local elections were not; and that's because of the last-minute nature of the organsation of this poll.  By the time it became clear that this election would be going ahead, preparations for the local elections were too far advanced to allow a general postponement.

We can also see the effects of this procrastination in the list of local by-elections today.  Local by-elections cost money and money is something which local government doesn't have an awful lot of, so piggybacking a local by-election onto the undercard of a general or European election is normally an opportunity that's too good to miss.  A combined poll helps the returning officer keep costs down, and helps the local parties by driving up turnout for the by-election.  In ordinary times a big nationwide poll would have dozens of local by-elections combined with it; but not this one.  There were just four local elections orginased today.  One of those is not a by-election at all but is our first piece of unfinished business from the ordinary local elections three weeks ago, and another is not taking place because only candidate stood.  <em>Llongyfarchiadau</em> and congratulations to Gareth Jones, newly elected to Gwynedd council as Plaid Cymru councillor for <em>Morfa Nefyn</em>, a tiny beach resort on the Llŷn.

That leaves just three polls on the undercard of the European elections, and a word is in order about how we're going to get the results this week.  The local by-elections will come through on Thursday night or Friday morning in the usual fashion, and they will have a very different complexion to the European results by dint of having a shorter ballot paper.  Apart from anythnig else, we are yet to see an official Brexit Party or Change UK candidate in a local government election.  The European result declarations can't start until the rest of the continent has finished voting at 10pm on Sunday (although the Netherlands usually ignores that rule and counts straight away...), and so counting in Great Britain and Gibraltar will start early on Sunday evening with two exceptions.  One is the Western Isles, because the Comhairle nan Eilean Siar isn't interested in breaking the Sabbath for something as important as an election count; they will phone their votes in to the returning officer for Scotland on Monday morning and allow Scotland to declare its result then.  The other is Northern Ireland, which will start counting at 8am on Bank Holiday Monday morning and finish when it finishes.  (I wonder if the Chief Electoral Officer will be paying bank holiday rates to the count staff?)  Otherwise, as usual, the European results will come in bit by bit from the UK's 400 or so local government districts.

The smallest of those European election counts, with comfortably under 2,000 electors on the roll, will be that taking place on the Isles of Scilly.  Yes, I promised you politics over the seas, didn't I?  There are certainly worse places to be: the Isles are the warmest part of the UK with a climate bordering on the subtropical.  Agriculture - particularly cut flowers, which bloom earlier in the season here than in the rest of the British Isles - was a traditional mainstay of the local economy, but there is now a hard dependence on tourism and administration; a tenth of the islands' adult population are either Scilly councillors or employed by the council, and most of the rest cater to tourists.  If the Scilly Isles were a ward, they would make the top 40 wards in England and Wales for self-employment.  There is a lot here for the tourists: the weather as already mentioned, some outstanding birdwatching, and for the politically-inclined the chance to pay your respects at the grave of the former Prime Minister Harold Wilson.  Wilson liked the Scilly Isles; he had a holiday home on St Mary's and is buried in the Old Town churchyard.  Following the death of his widow Mary last year, Wilson's Scilly home went on the market a couple of months back; if you have £425,000 in your back pocket, <a href="https://www.sibleysonscilly.co.uk/Properties/SalesDetail?UnitTypeID=178">it could be yours (link).</a> 

The islands have a unique and rather complicated legal status, perhaps best illustrated by the only slightly tongue-in-cheek Three Hundred and Thirty Five Years' War.  This goes back to the middle of the seventeenth century, when Cornwall was a stronghold of the Royalists in the Civil War.  The Royalist fleet had based itself in the archipelago after being driven out of the Cornish ports, and was having a good time raiding the Dutch navy (which was in alliance with the Roundheads); eventually the Dutch Lt-Admiral Maarten Tromp lost patience with this and turned up in the Scilly Isles in 1651 demanding reparations.  Not getting the answer he wanted, Tromp emulated his modern-day near-namesake by declaring war - specifically on the Isles of Scilly.  This war was essentially resolved within a month without a shot being fired thanks to the Royalist Navy's surrender to the Parliamentarians; but no treaty was signed at the time, and it was not until 1986 that the Dutch ambassador turned up on the islands to formally declare peace between Holland and Scillonia.

However, the Scilly Isles were the scene of a serious loss for the Royal Navy in 1707, during the War of the Spanish Succession, when a fleet on its way home from raiding Toulon was wrecked after mistaking Scilly for Ushant.  Only 35 leagues wrong, but that error led to the loss of four ships and at least 1,400 sailors.  One of those was Sir Cloudesley Shovell, the MP for Rochester and one of the most senior commanders in the Royal Navy.  The Scilly naval disaster was cited a few years later in the Parliamentary debates on the Longitude Act, which offered large financial rewards for an answer to the problem of determining longitude at sea.

The archipelago's remoteness and small population results in an unusual number of legal perks and administrative oddities.  Income tax did not apply here until 1954; road tax was first levied in 1971; the island's vehicles are still exempt from the MoT test.  The local sixth-form pupils get free travel to and a grant towards accommodation on the mainland, there being no sixth-form college here.  Although there are no full-time firefighters, the Isles have their own independent fire brigade staffed entirely by retained firefighters.

The Isles of Scilly Council is also a democratic body like no other within the remit of Andrew's Previews.  It was created in 1890 as the Isles of Scilly Rural District Council, but despite that name has always had a <em>sui generis</em> unitary status independent of Cornwall county council.  The council was left untouched by the Heath local government reforms and the 2009 Cornish local government reorganisation, and has never had a ward boundary change.  In fact until May 2017 the Isles of Scilly didn't have wards at all: it used the five inhabited islands as its electoral districts, with St Mary's electing thirteen councillors and Bryher, St Agnes, St Martin's and Tresco returning two each.  At least, that was the theory; however in the 2013 election only one candidate stood for Bryher, and nobody ever called a by-election to fill the second seat.  The Local Government Boundary Commission for England took a look at the Isles in advance of the 2017 election, and cut the council's membership from 21 to 16 councillors; it drew wards to match the previous electoral arrangements, with a single 12-seat ward for the island of St Mary's.  Given that the LGBCE <em>never</em> ordinarily draws wards with more than three councillors, you can see that the islands are very much an exceptional case.

In the 2017 Isles of Scilly election eighteen candidates contested the twelve seats on St Mary's (a nineteenth candidate withdrew).  Robert Francis topped the poll with 576 votes; Ted Moulson was elected in sixth place with 481 votes; and Stephen Sims (who had topped the poll in the 2013 election) won the twelfth and final seat on 376 votes, ahead of Amanda Martin who polled 321 and lost her seat.  There wasn't much love for Thomas Mitchell who finished last by a very long way after giving a home address in Northolt, west London; one wonders what his qualification for office would have been.  Fittingly for a place with the population of a medium-sized parish council, the election was non-partisan with all the candidates standing as independents.  Moulson became chairman of the counicl folllowing the 2017 election, but was challenged for the position a year later and lost to Francis.  Ted Moulson is standing down for personal reasons which have left him struggling to get to council meetings.

So we have this by-election, in which three-quarters of the Isles of Scilly's electors will be eligible to vote.  There are four candidates whom I shall take in alphabetical order.  Former councillor Andrew Coombes was the only candidate in this by-election who contested the 2017 Scilly elections; he finished seventeenth in St Mary's, polling 250 votes.  Tim Dean is a shuttle bus driver.  Jeanette Ware is a manager at the Isles of Scilly Steamship Company, which runs the ferry and the cargo ship connecting the archipelago to the mainland and (since the helicopter link to Penzance ended in 2012) has an effective monopoly on transport to and from the islands.  Completing the ballot paper is another former Isles of Scilly councillor, Steve Whomersley.
