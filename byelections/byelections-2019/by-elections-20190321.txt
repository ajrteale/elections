Six by-elections on 21st March 2019, and the only way to start the week is Essex...

<h2>Aveley and Uplands</h2>

Thurrock council, Essex; caused by the resignation of Thurrock Independents councillor Tim Aker.

Yes, to start the week we are in Essex, and our first poll is in a council where the Conservatives are in power, but not in control; they run the council as a minority administration, three seats short of an overall majority.  This sort of political situation means that the Thurrock Conservatives have to rule by consensus and compromise, and it would seem that they have learned the trick of how to do so: the council's budget for 2019-20, which included a freeze in council tax, was passed unanimously last month with support from the opposition Labour and independent councillors.

It takes a certain kind of politician to do consensus and compromise well.  Your columnist had a lot of time for David Cameron, who when he came to power in 2010 had the choice of trying to govern by minority or forge a consensus with other parties for a more lasting government.  He chose the coalition route.  Readers might not agree with everything or indeed anything the Coalition government did, but it hard to reasonably argue that the epic fail playing out in Westminster at the moment is a better alternative.

Consider: in four short years we have gone from a coalition of chaos under David Cameron to Theresa May's strong and stable government, from politicians of rival parties working together in the national interest to an atmosphere of hyperpartisanship where nobody seems to listen to anybody else or change their mind, from the UK being a major player on the international stage to becoming a laughing stock, from the government having a wide range of policies to having its entire political capital consumed by a single issue.

This dumpster fire may be raging through Westminster, but it appears to have alerady all but consumed the political party which lit the purple touchpaper in the first place.  It's a while since Andrew's Previews talked about UKIP, isn't it?  This column has a complicated relationshp with the UK Independence Party, which monopolised your columnist's local councillors until 2018 when councillor Paul Richardson lost his seat.  Richardson wasn't alone in that: every UKIP councillor who stood for re-election in May 2018 lost their seat.

And it's not just at the ballot box where UKIP are losing.  Since getting popular support for their signature policy nearly three years ago the party is on its fifth permanent leader and has suffered defections like there's no tomorrow; nearly every sizeable UKIP council group has split down the middle at some point, and one such split cost the party control of Thanet council which had returned a UKIP majority in 2015.  The party has spawned more splinter groups than your columnist can keep up with - even Nigel Farage has had enough and formed his own splinter in an attempt to rise like a phoenix from the UKIP dumpster fire.  Last week this column described Integrity Southampton as another UKIP splinter, which prompted a complaint from Integroty; they point out that none of their present candidates are associated with UKIP, and I am happy to set the record straight in that regard.

One of the more sizeable UKIP council groups was in Thurrock.  The party polled the most votes across Thurrock in the 2014 council elections (although it only won five out of sixteen wards, with Labour winning six and the Conservatives the other five).  One of the newly-elected UKIP councillors, Maggie O'Keeffe-Ray, died shortly afterwards; and the resulting by-election in December 2014 was sensationally won by a rising star of the party.  Timür "Tim" Aker was born in Thurrock in 1985 to British and Turkish parents, and grew up in the village of Aveley.  He read History and Politics at the University of Nottingham, and shortly after completing his studies stood for election to his home ward of Thurrock council, Aveley and Uplands.

This is the point on the north bank of the Thames estuary where Greater London ends and Essex begins; the M25 motorway is the ward's eastern boundary, while the A13 arterial road, the Tilbury railway line and High Speed 1 all pass through.  Aveley is the main centre of population; a village which has received some London overspill over the years, it was a Conservative area until the advent of Coalition although not always safely so.  A 31% score for the BNP in 2007 illustrated the potential for the populist right here.

Things started to go wrong for the Aveley Tories in 2011, when a former Tory councillor for the ward stood as an independent and split the Conservative vote.  The official Tories did hold the seat, but they polled only 28% of the vote in a close four-way result; coming in third with 24% was a 25-year-old Tim Aker standing for UKIP.  UKIP broke through to gain Aveley and Uplands the following year in another close four-way result; with Aker now head of the party's policy unit, it was Robert Ray who made the gain for them.  Ray's wife, Maggie O'Keeffe-Ray, made a second gain in May 2014 and turned Aveley and Uplands into a safe UKIP ward; on the same day Tim Aker was elected to the European Parliament, winning the sixth of the seven seats allocated to the East of England.

When O'Keeffe-Ray died five months later Aker was the natural candidate to succeed her, and he comfortably won the resulting by-election in December 2014 with 41% of the vote, to 29% for the Conservatives and 19% for Labour.  By this point Aker was already the UKIP PPC for the Thurrock constituency, which even without the UKIP factor would have attracted lots of attention in the 2015 general election; the Tory MP Jackie Doyle-Price, who had gained Thurrock for the Conservatives in the 2010 election, was sitting on a majority of just 92 votes.

If UKIP had performed just a little better in May 2015, Tim Aker would have entered Parliament as part of a UKIP group with Douglas Carswell.  He finished third in the 2015 Thurrock election in a very close three-way result, polling 32% against 34% for Doyle-Price and 33$ for Labour.  UKIP did have the consolation prize of winning the 2015 Thurrock election, polling 36% across the wards which held polls and winning seven of the sixteen seats up for eelction.  One of those was the final Tory seat in Aveley and Uplands, gained by a 40-28 margin over the Conservatives.  UKIP did even better in Aveley and Uplands in 2016, Ray being re-elceted with 55% of the vote against 24% for Labour and 21% for the Tories.  The party gained four seats on Thurrock council to draw level with the Conservatives as the largest party on 17 seats; UKIP fell one vote short of gaining Little Thurrock Blackshots ward at the ballot box, and subsequently fell one vote short of winning the leadership in the council chamber.

And then it all fell apart.  Against a backdrop of UKIP collapses in polls and council chambers, Thurrock's UKIP group remained united; but the June 2017 general election showed that the bubble had burst.  Aker was third again for UKIP, but this time finished a long way behind yet another Tory-Labour photofinish.  (Jackie Doyle-Price has now won three terms as MP for Thurrock with majorities totalling 973 votes.)

By January 2018 the Thurrock UKIP group had had enough of the national party's antics, and seceded from the party <em>en masse</em> to form a new party called the Thurrock Independents.  One of the Thurrock Independents councillors resigned immediately, and the resulting by-election in Ockendon ward resulted in a tie between the Conservatives and Labour on 696 votes each.  The Tories won the drawing of lots and the seat.

The May 2018 local elections saw Tim Aker being the only Thurrock Independents candidate to hold his seat, as the group lost three seats to Labour and one to the Conservatives.  He was nevertheless re-elected fairly comfortably with 43% of the vote, to 27% for a rather interesting choice of Tory candidate and 24% for Labour.  Aker has since resigned from Thurrock council causing this by-election; he has moved house away from Thurrock, and in his resignation statement also said that the Brexit political crisis had left him unable to properly fulfil his duties on the council.  He remains for now a memer of the European Parliament, having joined Nigel Farage's Brexit Party.  Aker is only 33, so we may not have heard the last of him yet.

In the meantime the Thurrock Independents have the job of defending this by-election.  Their caandidate is Alan Field, an RAF veteran and one of the driving forces behind the new Aveley community centre, being built by the council at a cost of £2 million.  The Tories have reselected their candidate from 2018, a man who is already notable enough for his own Wikipedia entry: David Van Day found fame as a member of the pop group Dollar, scoring five Top 10 hits in the 1970s and 1980s, and after that became a minor celebrity.  Day finished fourth in the 2008 series of <em>I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here</em>; that was a higher placing than he managed in the 2007 local elections in which he was on the Conservative slate for East Brighton ward of Brighton and Hove council, to little discernible effect.  There have been three by-elections in East Brighton since then so this is not Day's first appearance in Andrew's Previews, but it is his first starring role.  More orthodox is the Labour candidate Charles Curtis, who is hoping to return to Thurrock council after nearly four years away; he represented Belhus ward from 2007 to 2015.  Completing the ballot paper is the ward;'s first Liberal Democrat candidate since May 2014, Tomas Pilvelis.

<h2>Vange</h2>

Basildon council, Essex; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Kayte Block, who is taking up a new politically-restricted job as a prosecutor.  She had served since 2016.

For the second of our three by-elections in south Essex we come to a New Town.  Vange is an old village - parts of its church, dedicated to All Saints, date from the late 12th century - but its housing is New Town development from the late 1960s.  This is a seriously deprived ward with low quailfication levels; in fact Vange is in the top 10 wards in England and Wales for adults with fewer than five GCSE passes or equivalent, and social housing rates are very high.
