One Wednesday by-election on 13th November 2019:

<hr/>

<h2>Aldersgate</h2>

City of London Corporation; caused by the resignation of Labour Common Councilman Richard Crossen.

For a rare Wednesday by-election we travel to the ancient City of London.  This has unique local government arrangements in that is still controlled by the City of London Corporation, whose structure is little modified since mediaeval times.  Aldersgate ward lies on the northern edge of the old City, on both sides of the Roman Wall, and took its name from a gate in the wall.  This gate was the scene of an early instance of fake news, when in 1554 a serving-maid called Elizabeth Crofts was smuggled into a hollow wall, from where she shouted some anti-Catholic slogans into the street.  A crowd of 17,000 people apparently gathered.  Zuckerberg, take note.

Other famous residents of Aldersgate Street included the Bishop of London, who had lodgings here, and someone called William Shakespeare who is recorded in 1598 as the owner of 134 Aldersgate Street (a site now occupied by Barbican underground station).  There was a Moravian chapel at 28 Aldersgate Street where, on 24 May 1738, John Wesley had a religious experience which led him to found the Methodist Church.  The Methodists still celebrate Aldersgate Day each in May in honour of this.

These buildings no longer exist.  Aldersgate Street and the surrounding area was devastated by enemy bombing in the Second World War, leaving an open space which the City Corporation eventually filled with the modernist Barbican housing estate.  This was not social housing, instead being let by the City at commercial rates to professionals.  We can see this in the census return for the City as a whole, which in 2011 had a population of 7,375: if the City was a single ward (and it has the population of one), it would be number 1 in England and Wales for the the ONS "higher management" employment category (35%) and number 3 for the proportion of adults with a degree or equivalent qualification (68%).  Around a quarter of those 7,375 people live in Aldersgate ward, which is the western half of the Barbican estate and is one of the City's "residential" wards.

So, how do these people vote?  Rather difficult to tell, is the answer to that.  In the 2016 London Assembly elections, Zac Goldsmith beat Sadiq Khan 40-38 across the City of London, while the London Members ballot gave 36% to the Conservatives, 29% to Labour and 10% each to the Lib Dems and Greens.  Unlike most GLA voting figures quoted by this column, these figures include postal votes (which does make a difference: Khan carried the on-the-day votes in the City but Goldsmith had a big lead in the postals).  The EU referendum a month later saw the City return a 75% Remain vote.  In a rare case of European Parliament results being available at what's effectively ward level, we can also look at what happened in the City on 23 May this year: this gives a completely different picture, with 41% for the Liberal Democrats, 16% for the Brexit Party, 15% for the Greens and 11% for Labour.  You can see what's attracted Labour to Lib Dem defector Chuka Umunna to seek re-election to Parliament here, rather than in his former Streatham constituency.  At parliamentary level the Cities of London and Westminster is normally a safe Tory seat that doesn't attract much comment; however with Labour having made it marginal in 2017 and with the retirement of Tory MP Mark Field, things look interesting in the Twin Cities this time.

What effect will this have on the by-election?  Very little.  City Corporation elections are generally non-partisan affairs and Labour is the only organised political party that contests them.  The last City elections were in March 2017, when Aldersgate ward had six independent candidates and one Labour candidate nominated; since there were seven seats available, they were all declared elected without further ado.

Defending for Labour is Helen Fentiman, a magistrate, school governor, and former Chief Nurse and NHS chief executive.  She is opposed by four independent candidates: Shahnan Bakth, Ian Burleigh, Paul Clifford and Heather Thomas.  All five candidates give addresses on the Barbican estate.

There are eight local by-elections on 14th November 2019 in the biggest test before the next general election.  Your columnist has been out of the country for the last week and these previews were written before I left, so in these volatile political times something in this piece is almost certainly out of date.  Hopefully the anachronism - whatever it is - will be amusing.

There's a wide geographical spread and something for everyone this week, with two by-elections in Wales, three in England and three in Scotland.  Which is where we start:

<hr/>

<h2>Inverness Central</h4>

Highland council, Scotland; caused by the resignation of Scottish National Party councillor Richard Laird on health grounds.  He had served since 2012.

We start in the far north of what remains for now the UK, the capital of the Scottish Highlands.  Inverness' location is coded in its name: it's the mouth of the River Ness, at the northern end of the Great Glen.  The Central ward is the hub of a growing city; the city centre, the castle and the railway station are all here, together with the South Kessock and Merkinch areas between the river and the Caledonian Canal.  Inverness has an unusual distinction for the UK government, in that the first cabinet meeting held outside London took place here: David Lloyd George, who was on holiday in the Highlands at the time, convened a Cabinet in the Inverness Town House in 1921 to discuss the Irish situation.

Inverness is the home of the Highland Council, which administers the UK's largest local government district; so it may come as a surprise that the Central ward is so geographically compact.  The ward was created in 2007 as a four-seat district, and at its first election the four seats went to Donnie Kerr of the SNP, independent candidate Peter Corbett, Janet Campbell of the Lib Dems and Elizabeth "Bet" McAllister for Labour, all of whom won comfortably.  In 2012 Corbett retired and Campbell successfully sought re-election as an independent candidate; Corbett's seat went to the second SNP candidate Richard Laird, who won fairly narrowly over the replacement Lib Dem Angus Dick.

Boundary changes for the 2017 election reduced the number of Highland councillors from 80 to 74, and one of the six seats which disappeared was in Inverness Central ward which went down to three councillors on slightly reduced boundaries.  All four outgoing councillors stood for re-election, so somebody was going to miss out.  In the event, the one who missed out was Donnie Kerr, who sought re-election as an independent candidate: he polled 11% of the vote and was eliminated in fifth place.  The SNP's Richard Laird topped the poll with 33% and was elected on the first count; second and third were Bet McAllister for Labour (17%) and independent Janet Campbell (15%), who pulled away from the Conservatives' Donald Mackenzie (12%) to win the final two seats comfortably.  Allan Faulds of <em>Ballot Box Scotland</em> has crunched the numbers as usual, finding that if the 2017 Inverness Central election had been for one seat then the SNP would have won easily after transfers.

So this looks like an simple enough defence for the SNP going into a general election where they have to defend the marginal seat of Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey.  Their defending candidate in this by-election is Emma Roddick, who works for the local ambulance service and volunteers for a mental health charity.  Labour have selected Ardalan Eghtedar, a dentist who fought Inverness West in 2017.  There is one independent candidate on the ballot paper: Richie Paxton, who owns a guest house.  The Conservatives have selected Rachel Hatfield.  Also standing are Russell Deacon for the Scottish Green Party (who stood here in 2017) and Mary Dormer for the Liberal Democrats.

<h2>Dunfermline Centrel; and<br/>
Rosyth</h2>

Fife council, Scotland; caused respectively by the resignations of Conservative councillor Alan Craig and Scottish National Party councillor Sam Steele, both of whom had served since 2017.  Steele is resigning on health grounds.

From the capital of the Highlands we travel to a town which could arguably have been the capital of Scotland.  Dunfermline is first mentioned in the eleventh century as the wedding-place of King Malcolm III Canmore and St Margaret of Wessex; this was shortly after the Norman conquest of England, and Margaret - as the sister of Edgar the Atheling, the Anglo-Saxon claimant to the throne - wasn't safe south of the border.  Malcolm and St Margaret had eight children together, including three future kings of Scotland (Edgar, Alexander I and David I) and a daughter, Edith or Matilda, who in time married the English king Henry I.  St Margaret did many good works for the Kingdoms of Scotland and Fife, including establishing a ferry link over the Firth of Forth (from which the modern villages of North and South Queensferry take their name); she was eventually buried in Dunfermline, establishing a royal mausoleum in the town.

Dunfermline lost its royal connections after James VI inherited the English throne in 1603 and moved his court to London.  The town then went into a decline until the 18th century when a linen industry was established.

Things further turned up in 1909, when a garden city was founded to the south of Dunfermline to house workers at a large new development: the Royal Naval Dockyard, Rosyth.  This was a time when the Royal Navy and the German Navy were in an arms race, and the Admiralty wanted a beefier naval presence on the east coast to counter the German threat.  Rosyth Dockyard was privatised by the Thatcher government but is still very much in operation, most recently building the UK's two new aircraft carriers.  HMS <em>Queen Elizabeth</em> was commissioned in 2017; HMS <em>Prince of Wales</em>, is currently at Rosyth being fitted out for handover to the senior service later this year.

The replacement of Queen Margaret's ferry by the Forth Road Bridge in 1964 (subsequently replaced by the Queensferry Crossing in 2017) brought Dunfermline and Rosyth within commuting distance of Edinburgh, and over the last few decades Dunfermline's population has boomed.  There is also plenty of manufacturing and employment in the town, with Sky and Amazon being major employers.  Dunfermline is now the largest town in Fife and a major service centre for the local area.  The Central ward covers the town centre and extends to the east along the A92 road towards Kirkcaldy and Glenrothes.  Following boundary changes in 2017 (which removed the village of North Queensferry) Rosyth ward is based on the town itself plus some villages (like Limekilns and Crombie) on the north bank of the Forth to the west.

The first elections to these wards were in 2007 and came hard on the heels of the Dunfermline and West Fife parliamentary by-election in 2006, which the Liberal Democrats had taken off Labour.  The Lib Dems topped the poll in Dunfermline Central in 2007 with 42% of the first preferences, and won two out of four seats; Labour and the SNP took the other two.  There was a big swing from the Lib Dems to Labour in 2012, mirroring the Labour recovery at the 2010 general election; the Lib Dems didn't defend their second seat in Dunfermline Central and Labour had no problem picking it up.  Rosyth ward had a similar trajectory, with its three seats splitting Labour-SNP-Lib Dem in 2007 and Labour picking up the Lib Dem seat in 2012.

Things changed following the 2014 Indyref and subsequent SNP surge.  Douglas Chapman, the SNP councillor for Rosyth, was elected in the 2015 general election as MP for Dunfermline and West Fife; he resigned from Fife council to concentrate on his duties in Westminster, and the SNP held the resulting Rosyth by-election in November 2015.

In the 2017 Fife elections, the SNP went into first place in both Dunfermline Central and Rosyth wards, and the Conservatives gained seats in both areas.  Rosyth ward gave 36% to the SNP, 22% to the Conservatives and 18% to Labour, with the Conservatives picking up the second Labour seat.  Dunfermline Central had a more complicated result, with 30% for the SNP, 26% for Labour, 24% for the Conservatives and 9% for independent candidate Doug Hay.  The Tories' Alan Craig topped the poll and picked up the seat previously held by the Lib Dems.  Hay was eliminated in sixth place, just 2 votes behind the second SNP candidate Neale Hanvey, and his transfers went strongly to Labour to enable Labour to hold their two seats.  Hanvey lost his seat to his running-mate; in the general election next month he will try to recover the Labour seat of Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath.

Again, Allan Faulds of <em>Ballot Box Scotland</em> (whatever would we do without him?) has crunched the numbers to see what would have happened in a single-seat election in 2017; the answer to that is that the SNP would have won Rosyth, but Labour would have won Dunfermline Central thanks to Conservative transfers.  With the constituency of Dunfermline and West Fife having been close between the SNP and Labour in June 2017, all parties will be looking to make a good impression in these by-elections.  There are no implications for control of Fife council, which is run by a grand coalition of the SNP and Labour with a secure majority.

Defending Rosyth for the SNP is Sharon Green-Wilson, who has appeared in this column before: she was the winner of the November 2015 Rosyth by-election, but lost her seat in 2017 to her running-mate Samantha Steele.  Having married since 2017 and changed her surname from Wilson, Sharon will have a better place on the alphabetical ballot paper if she seeks election again in 2022.  This by-election is one of those cases where the candidate list raises more questions than it answers, and there is a story to be told - which I have regrettably yet to got to the bottom of - regarding the Tory candidate Margaret Fairgrieve.  She gives the same address on her nomination papers as independent candidate Alastair Macintyre, a gardener who returns for his fourth go at Rosyth ward.  Macintyre was the UKIP candidate here in 2012, and in 2017 he polled 2% and finished last of nine candidates.  The Labour candidate can expect to do better than that: he is Billy Pollock, who fought the neighbouring ward of Dunfermline South in 2017.  Also standing in Rosyth are Jill Blair for the Lib Dems, Craig McCutcheon for the Scottish Greens and Calum Paul (from Kirkcaldy) for the Libertarian Party.

The Tories have an uphill task in trying to defend Dunfermline Central from third place.  Their defending candidate is Chloe Dodds, who has appeared in this column before: she was the UKIP candidate in a by-election to Fife council in Dunfermline North ward in November 2015, finishing in last place on that occasion.  The SNP have selected Derek Glen, organiser for the party's Dunfermline branch.  The Labour candidate is Michael Boyd, a former postman and hospital radio presenter who is associated with the GMB union; he fought Dunfermline North ward in 2017.  As with all Scottish local by-elections, Votes at 16 and the Alternative Vote apply, so transfers from whichever of these candidates finishes third could be crucial in the final reckoning.  Also standing are Aude Boubaker-Calder for the Liberal Democrats, Fiona McOwan for the Scottish Greens and Keith Chamberlain for the Libertarian Party.

<h2>Shap</h2>

Eden council, Cumbria; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor John Owen, who had served since 2015.

We travel south of the Border but not very far.  Shap is a place where many pass through but few stop: the A6 road, M6 motorway and West Coast Main Line all go through or past this linear settlement, which is legally a town although the market charter has been dormant for many years.  All of these transport routes pass over the hills to the south on their way to Lancaster: the railway and motorway head south-east towards Tebay and the Lune Gorge, the A6 south-west towards Kendal over the Shap Fells.  This road had a formidable reputation with its sharp curves, steep gradients, high altitude (over 1,400 feet) and propensity for awful weather.  Until the motorway was built, many road travellers from England to western Scotland preferred to avoid the area entirely by travelling via the A1 east of the Pennines as far as Scotch Corner - which is how that road junction got its name.  Shap may have declined a bit since the golden age of motoring, but there is still some accommodation here which is well-used by hikers: the town is a recommended stopping point on Wainwright's Coast to Coast Walk.  Tourism, sheep farming and quarrying are all major source of income here.  In the 2011 census Shap was in the top 25 wards in England and Wales for those born in the UK (98.7%) and in the top 100 for the White British ethnic group (98.4%).

The Shap district ward also covers the mountainous Shap Fell, and extends as far as the eastern bank of Haweswater.  Not that this increases the electorate, as the villages in Mardale were flooded in the 1930s to supply drinking water for distant Manchester.  Haweswater now accounts for around a quarter of United Utilities' water supply.

We're in the Eden local government district here, which doesn't always mean that we get the finest local election results known to humanity.  Eden is an extremely far-flung and - as a look at Shep Fell will tell you - very sparsely populated district, and many of its wards go uncontested at election time.  Shap has generally escaped this fate, and some of this will be down to Tory opposition to one man.

Unlike most people, Neil Hughes has had the ups and downs of his life played out on national television over the last fifty-six years.  He was one of the fourteen seven-year-old children selected in 1963 by Michael Apted for a documentary series called <em>7 Up</em>, and Apted has returned every seven years since then to film Neil and the twelve other surviving children.  Neil was the only one of the children who went into politics, joining the Liberal Democrats and serving on Hackney council in London in the 1990s.  He subsequently moved to rural Cumbria, and from 2003 to 2015 was the Eden district councillor for Shap ward.  Hughes was still in that post when the above film was made for <em>56 Up</em> seven years ago; he has since left Eden council after being elected to Cumbria county council in 2013.  Neil still holds that county council seat.  Earlier this year he went through it all again for the benefit of national television, participating in <em>63 Up</em>.

Neil Hughes isn't the only person with a compelling life story associated with Shap.  Consider: a successful author, hiker, diplomat, colonial governor, Harvard lecturer, TV presenter, Old Etonian, Member of Parliament, Cabinet minister, party leadership candidate, <em>GQ</em> Politician of the Year.  The MP for the local seat of Penrith and the Border until last week, Rory Stewart is or has been all of those things, but he has also been banished from Eden into the political wilderness.  Apparently there's no place for him in the modern Conservative Party.

The Lib Dems didn't put up a candidate for Shap when Hughes retired from Eden council in 2015, and the Conservative candidate John Owen was subsequently elected unopposed.  Owen did face a contest in May this year, when he was re-elected with a 51-31 lead over the Lib Dems.  He had previously been chairman of the council-owned company Heart of Cumbria, but resigned from the board of directors and then the council after the Eden council leadership stripped him of his decision-making powers.  Owen may have been re-elected in May but the Tory administration wasn't: the Conservatives lost their majority on Eden council and a rainbow coalition of all the other groups has taken control.

So we have a by-election.  Defending for the Conservatives is Sean Quinn, a volunteer youth worker who gives an address in the village of Kirkby Thore.  He is opposed by the two losing candidates for Shap in May: Neil McCall, from Crosby Ravensworth, for the Lib Dems; and local resident Kerryanne Wilde of the Putting Cumbria First party, who finished in third and last place here in May snd also finished last at a subsequent local by-election in Penrith.

<h2>Rhos</h2>

Neath Port Talbot council, Glamorgan; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Alex Thomas who had served since 2012.

We move into Wales for two by-elections in the south of the country.  The village of Rhos can be found on the hillside above Pontardawe in the Swansea Valley, along the road to Neath, and is counted by the Royal Mail as part of Pontardawe.  Like many places in South Wales this was a pit village which grew from almost nothing in the nineteenth century; unlike many places in South Wales there was still coalmining going on here into the twenty-first century.  The division boundary runs for some miles along the wooded south side of the Tawe, and includes the site of the small Gleision Colliery, a drift mine into the hillside which flooded in 2011, killing four miners.

Alex Thomas had been the councillor for Rhos since 2012 when he defeated the former Plaid Cymru councillor Marcia Spooner.  Spooner tried to get her seat back at the most recent Neath Port Talbot elections in May 2017, but Thomas increased his majority; shares of the ote were 46% for Labour, 31% for Plaid and 24% for the Conservatives' Amanda Wycherley, who must have been Furious that she didn't do better.  Mind, 24% is not a bad Tory score at all in a Valleys constituency.

Defending for Labour is Rupert Denholm-Hall, a freelance journalist.  Marcia Spooner, a local community councillor, tries again for Plaid Cymru.  The Conservatives have selected Yvonne Lewis, who completes the ballot paper.

<h2>St Mary</h2>

Powys council, Mid and West Wales; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Sarah Lewis who had served since 2017.

For our second Welsh by-election of the week we travel to Brecon.  Historically the county town of Breconshire, or Brecknockshire if you prefer, Brecon is now only the third largest town in Powys (Newtown and Ystradgynlais are larger) but is still an important place.

Last week we were in a part of Pembrokeshire where the men from the military have been since shortly after the Norman conquest.  Brecon has been fortified for an awful lot longer: the Romans were here in the first century AD, building a fort near the modern town then called <em>Cicucium</em> and now known as Y Gaer, guarding a ford on the River Usk.  Cicucium was staffed by 500 cavalrymen from faraway Spain; what they thought of the Welsh weather is not recorded.  The Normans refortified Brecon by building a castle in the late eleventh century, erecting town walls in the thirteenth century and improving them in 1404 to protect the town from the Glyndŵr rebellion.

The men from the military are still in Brecon today.  A barracks was built in the town in 1805, and it eventually became the headquarters for the 24th Foot - later the South Wales Borderers - which found fame in the Zulu War in 1879 at Isandlwana and Rorke's Drift.  Their successors, 160th (Wales) Brigade, are still based at Brecon Barracks today, and elsewhere in the town is the regimental museum of the Royal Welsh.  Brecon Barracks are scheduled for closure in the next decade, but for officers and Other Ranks the Infantry Battle School is also in Brecon, and the military have left their mark on the town's 2011 census return in an unexpected way.  St Mary division made the top 15 wards or divisions in England and Wales for Buddhism, at 3.2% of the population: this is not because Brecon is a new-agey sort of place (it's not), it's due to a company of Gurkhas being stationed here.

St Mary is the easterly of Brecon's three electoral divisions, which are all named after churches.  It covers the town centre and runs from there down the Usk Valley, including all the military sites.  The division has often been closely fought in recent times, the Lib Dems coming out on top in three-way marginal results in 2008 and 2012.  In 2017 the long-serving Lib Dem councillor Paul Ashton retired, and St Mary was gained rather convincingly by Sarah Lewis for the Conservatives.  Shares of the vote were 41% for the Conservatives, 27% for the Lib Dems and 21% for Labour, for whom Brecon is one of their strongest areas in Powys.  The local Conservatives may, however, still be reeling from the loss of the local parliamentary seat to the Lib Dems at the Brecon and Radnorshire by-election in August.  There is no love lost between the disgraced former Tory MP Chris Davies and outgoing St Mary councillor Sarah Lewis, who used to run Davies' constituency office but was reported in May to be suing him for unfair dismissal.

Defending for the Conservatives is Alan Roberts, the vice-chairman of Brecon County Show: he is a businessman who spent over 35 years in the police service.  Another Roberts on the ballot paper is Gareth Roberts, who is the Liberal Democrat candidate.  The Labour candidate is Liz Rijnenberg, a Brecon town councillor who is now retired after a distinguished career in the Probation Service, for which she was appointed OBE in 2016.  Also standing are Grenville Ham for Plaid Cymru and independent candidate Gareth Phillips, who is notable enough for Wikipedia: Phillips has been an actor since he was a child, and played Nick Williams in <em>Grange Hill</em> from 1990 to 1992.

<h2>Goodrington with Roselands</h2>

Torbay council, Devon; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Rick Heyse who had served only since May this year.

We travel across the Bristol Channel to the English Riviera for this week's Liberal Democrat defence.  The village of Goodrington can be found on the western shore of Tor Bay, just to the south of Paignton.  This is of course holiday country, and in season (which we are not) Paignton Zoo, the Splashdown Quaywest water park and Goodrington's beach attract tourists.  Next to the beach and water park is Goodrington's railway station, which Google Maps mistakenly shows as National Rail; in fact the station is run by the Paignton and Dartmouth Steam Railway, a preserved line.

Torbay council dates from 1968 when it was formed as the County Borough of Torbay, incorporating Torquay, Paignton and Brixham.  The local government reorganisation of 1974 demoted Torbay to a district under Devon county council, but the borough regained its independence in the 1990s as one of the UK's smaller unitary councils.

Since then Torbay has often seesawed wildly between Conservative and Lib Dem control, and Goodrington with Roselands ward's history reflects that.  In 2003 it elected two Lib Dems comfortably but since then the ward has been a closely-fought marginal.  The Tories gained one seat in 2007 and the other in 2011.  On slightly revised boundaries for the 2019 election the Lib Dems fought back, gaining both seats in Goodrington with Roselands by the narrow margin of 31% to 28%; an independent candidate and UKIP had 13% each.

Torbay's elected mayoralty was abolished this year following a 2016 referendum, sending political control back to the council, and that was bad news for the Conservatives.  They are the largest party on Torbay council, but are short of a majority which has allowed the Lib Dems and independent councillors to take control of the administration.

Defending this marginal seat for the Liberal Democrats is Dennis Shearman, who fought the neighbouring ward of Churston with Galmpton in May.  The Tories have reselected Jane Barnby, who was a councillor for this ward from 2011 until May when she lost her seat by 45 votes.  The independent candidate and UKIP have not returned, although Eddie Davis might be considered to be fishing in the former UKIP vote pool; Davis is that rare thing, a local government candidate for the Brexit Party.  Also standing are Jane Hughes for the Green Party and Catherine Fritz for Labour.

<h2>Culverden</h2>

Tunbridge Wells council, Kent; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Ronen Basu.  Born in Varanasi in India, Basu was a consultant pathologist who became Clinical Director of Pathology at Tunbridge Wells Hospital.  He also did pioneering research in cellular pathology, and had worked for the World Health Organisation.  After retiring from the medical sector Basu entered politics and had served as a Tunbridge Wells councillor since 2008; he was Mayor of Tunbridge Wells in 2013-14, had been the council's cabinet member for sustainability, and also chaired Tunbridge Wells in Bloom.  He had been married for 41 years to Sue, who survives him.

We finish for the week in the stereotypical land of green ink, the spiritual home of Sir Bufton Tufton and his ilk, the favoured location of retired colonels who are exasperated at the current state of affairs; or, to use the modern and rather offensive equivalent term, "gammons".  Now, the Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells meme has been going on for so long it's become a cliché, and one that the town would rather like to move away from, thank you very much.  The country has changed, and Tunbridge Wells has changed with it.  The census return for Culverden ward, which runs north-west from the town's railway station, rather bears this out: this is a highly-educated ward full of people who are young enough to work in middle-class, professional jobs.  11% of its residents were born outside the EU.  This youngish professional demographic is a very poor fit for the "Disgusted" "gammon" stereotype, and it's people like the residents of Culverden ward who meant that Tunbridge Wells was the only district in Kent carried by Remain in the EU referendum.

It's people like that which also mean that Culverden ward is normally a Tory banker when election time comes.  From 2002 (when the current ward boundaries were drawn up) to 2015 Culverden consistently returned a Conservative vote of between 47% and 59%, with the Lib Dems, Greens and UKIP all holding the runner-up spot at some point in that period.  In 2016 Labour moved into second place and Dr Basu, at his final re-election, saw the Tory vote fall to 44%; but with a very split opposition there wasn't cause for concern.  In 2017 the Conservatives very easily held Tunbridge Wells West in the Kent county council elections and the Tunbridge Wells parliamentary seat re-elected the business secretary Greg Clark without fuss.

And then all hell broke loose.  Tunbridge Wells council had come up with a cunning plan to build a new theatre/civic centre/underground car park complex on Calverley Square, to replace the current Assembly Halls theatre and council offices.  Looks nice in the picture.  However this cunning plan went down with, for want of a better word, disgust among the public, who objected to the cost (£90 million and counting) and the fact that it would be built on part of the Calverley Grounds park just outside Culverden ward.  A new political party was set up in opposition to the proposals - the Tunbridge Wells Alliance - and it won Park ward, covering the proposed development site, at the May 2018 local elections.  The Tunbridge Wells Alliance also finished second in Culverden ward, polling 23%; the Tory vote fell to just 30% and only a five-way vote split saved their seat.  Despite this, the Tunbridge Wells council planning committee gave the project the thumbs-up shortly after the election was over.

For the public reaction to this in the May 2019 local elections, take a look at the map below, and beat in mind that the Conservatives were defending <em>all seventeen</em> wards up for election:

<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/2019/tunbridge-wells19.png" />

A picture tells a thousand words.  The pink wards represent the Tunbridge Wells Alliance, which didn't stand in Culverden; nonetheless Culverden ward turned in an astonishing result.  The Liberal Democrats came from third place to win the ward, polling 32% of the vote.  Second place, in the party's best-ever election result, went to Liz Orr of the Women's Equality Party, the feminist movement founded by the journalists Catherine Meyer and Sandi Toksvig. Orr, who had been endorsed by the Tunbridge Wells Alliance, polled 25% of the vote, the same as the Conservatives who were pushed down to third place; Labour finished fourth with 11%.  That was one of thirteen seats the Conservatives lost in Tunbridge Wells in May, and only the thirds electoral system preserved their council majority.  Subsequently a full council meeting in October threw the Calverley Square plan out, and a cross-party working group is now looking at where we go from here.

In the background shenanigans have been going on at parliamentary level too.  Greg Clark held his position as business secretary throughout the May administration, but there was no place for him in the Johnson cabinet.  Clark is a staunch opponent of no-deal Brexit, and like Rory Stewart earlier in his column was one of the 21 Tory MPs who lost the whip for voting in favour of the European Union (Withdrawal) (No 2) Act 2019, the so-called Benn Act.  Unlike Stewart, Greg Clark did subsequently get the Conservative whip back, but when this piece was written (last week) it wasn't clear whether he would seek re-election.  Nominations for the general election close today, so the picture may be clearer by now.

Lots for the local electors to take in, there.  Defending this surprisingly difficult seat for the Conservatives is David Elliott, a former Mayor of Tunbridge Wells who represented Southborough North ward from 2007 until losing his seat in May.  The Liberal Democrats have selected Justine Rutland, a copywriter and marketing manager for the local Puppetry Festival.  Liz Orr returns for the Women's Equality Party after her second-place finish in May.  Labour have reselected David Adams, who runs a research company in the financial sector.  Also standing are Rachel Daly for the Tunbridge Wells Alliance and Aimee Taylor for the Green Party.
