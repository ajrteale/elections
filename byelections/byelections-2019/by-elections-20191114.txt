There are eight local by-elections on 14th November 2019 in the biggest test before the next general election.  Your columnist has been out of the country for the last week and these previews were written before I left, so in these volatile political times something in this piece is almost certainly out of date.  Hopefully the anachronism will be amusing.

There's a wide geographical spread this week, with two by-elections in Wales, three in England and three in Scotland.  Which is where we start:

<h2>Inverness Central</h4>

Highland council, Scotland; caused by the resignation of Scottish National Party councillor Richard Laird on health grounds.  He had served since 2012.

We start in the far north of what remains for now the UK, the capital of the Scottish Highlands.  Inverness' location is coded in its name: it's the mouth of the River Ness, at the northern end of the Great Glen.  The Central ward is the hub of a growing city; the city centre, the castle and the railway station are all here, together with the South Kessock and Merkinch areas between the river and the Caledonian Canal.  Inverness has an unusual distinction for the UK government, in that the first cabinet meeting held outside London took place here: David Lloyd George, who was on holiday in the Highlands at the time, convened a Cabinet in the Inverness Town House in 1921 to discuss the Irish situation.

Inverness is the home of the Highland Council, which administers the UK's largest local governmetn district; so it may come as a surprise that the Central ward is so geographically compact.  The ward was created in 2007 as a four-seat district, and at its first election the four seats went to Donnie Kerr of the SNP, independent candidate Peter Corbett, Janet Campbell of the Lib Dems and Elizabeth "Bet" McAllister for Labour, all of whom won comfortably.  In 2012 Corbett retired and Campbell successfully sought re-election as an independent candidate; Corbett's seat went to the second SNP candidate Richard Laird, who won fairly narrowly over the replacement Lib Dem Angus Dick.

Boundary changes for the 2017 election reduced the number of Highland councillors from 80 to 74, and one of the six seats which disappeared was in Inverness Central ward which went down to three councillors on slightly reduced boundaries.  All four outgoing councillors stood for re-election, so somebody was going to miss out.  In the event, the one who missed out was Donnie Kerr, who sought re-election as an independent candidate: he polled 11% of the vote and was eliminated in fifth place.  The SNP's Richard Laird topped the poll with 33% and was elected on the first count; second and third were Bet McAllister for Labour (17%) and independent Janet Campbell (15%), who pulled away from the Conservatives' Donald Mackenzie (12%) to win the final two seats comfortably.  Allan Faulds of <em>Ballot Box Scotland</em> has crunched the numbers as usual, finding that if the 2017 Inverness Central election had been for one seat then the SNP would have won easily after transfers.

So this looks like an easy defence for the SNP going into a general election where they have to defend the marginal seat of Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey.  Their defending candidate in this by-election is Emma Roddick, who works for the local ambulance service and volunteers for a mental health charity.  Labour have selected Ardalan Eghtedar, a dentist who fought Inverness West in 2017.  There is one independent candidate on the ballot paper: Richie Paxton, who owns a guest house.  The Conservatives have selected Rachel Hatfield.  Also standing are Russell Deacon for the Scottish Green Party (who stood here in 2017) and Mary Dormer for the Liberal Democrats.

<h2>Dunfermline Centrel; and<br/>
Rosyth</h2>

Fife council, Scotland; caused respectively by the resignations of Conservative councillor Alan Craig and Scottiah National Party councillor Sam Steele, both of whom had served since 2017.  Steele is resigning on health grounds.

From the capital of the Highlands we travel to a town which could arguably have been the capital of Scotland.  Dunfermline is first mentioned in the eleventh century as the wedding-place of King Malcolm III Canmore and St Margaret of Wessex; this was shortly after the Norman conqueet of England, and Margaret - as the sister of Edgar the Atheling, the Anglo-Saxon claimant to the throne - wasn't safe south of the border.  Malcolm and St Margaret had eight children together, including three future kings of Scotland (Edgar, Alexander I and David I) and a daughter, Edith or Matilda, who in time married the English king Henry I.  St Margaret did many good works for the Kingdoms of Scotland and Fife, establihsing a ferry link over the Firth of Forth (from which the modern villages of North and South Queensferry take their name) and was eventually buried in Dunfermline, establishing a royal mausoleum in the town.

Dunfermline lost its royal connections after James VI inherited the English throne in 1603 and moved his court to London.  The town then went into a decline until the 18th century when a linen industry was established.

Things further turned up in 1909, when a garden city was founded to the south of Dunfermline to house workers at a large new development: the Royal Naval Dockyard, Rosyth.  This was a time when the Royal Nacy and the German Navy were in an arms race, and the Admiralty wanted a beefier neval presence on the east coast to counter the German threat.  Rosyth Dockyard was privatiesd by the Thatcher government but is still very much in operation, most recently building the UK's two new aircraft carriers.  HMS <em>Queen Elizabeth</em> was commissioned in 2017; HMS <em>Prince of Wales</em>, is currently at Rosyth being fitted out for handover to the senior service later this year.

The replacement of Queen Margaret's ferry by the Forth Road Bridge in 1964 (and its subsequent replacement by the Queensferry Crossing in 2017) brought Dunfermline and Rosyth within commuting distance of Edinburgh, and over the last few decades Dunfermline's population has boomed.  There is also plenty of manufactoring and employment in the town, with Sky and Azamon being major employers.  Dunfermline is now the largest town in Fife and a major service centre for the local area.  The Central ward covers the town centre and extends to the east along the A92 road towards Kirkcaldy and Glenrothes.  Following boundary changes in 2017 (which removed the village of North Queensferry) Rosyth ward is based on the town itself plus some villages (like Limekilns and Crombie) on the north bank of the Forth to the west.

The first elections to these wards were in 2007 and came hard on the heels of the Dunfermline and West Fife parliamentary by-election in 2006, which the Liberal Democrats had taken off Labour.  The Lib Dems topped the poll in Dunfermline Central in 2007 with 42% of the first preferences, and won two out of four seats; Labour and the SNP took the other two.  There was a big swing from the Lib Dems to Labour in 2012, mirroring the Labour recovery at the 2010 general election; the Lib Dems didn't defend their second seat in Dunfermline Central and Labour had no problem picking it up.  Rosyth ward had a similar trajectory, with its three seats splitting Labour-SNP-Lib Dem in 2007 and Labour picking up the Lib Dem seat in 2012.

Things changed following the 2014 Indyref and subsequent SNP surge.  Douglas Chapman, the SNP councillor for Rosyth, was elected in the 2015 general election as MP for Dunfermline and West Fife; he resigned from Fife council to concentrate on his duties in Westminster, and the SNP held the resulting Rosyth by-election.

In the 2017 Fife elections, the SNP went into first place in both Dunfermline Central and Rosyth wards, and the Conservatives gained seats in both areas.  Rosyth ward gave 36% to the SNP, 22% to the Conservatives and 18% to Labour, with the Conservatives picking up the second Labour seat.  Dunfermline Central had a more complicated result, with 30% for the SNP, 26% for Labour, 24% for the Conservatives and 9% for independent candidate Doug Hay.  The Tories' Alan Craig topped the poll and picked up the seat previously held by the Lib Dems.  Hay was eliminated in sixth place, just 2 votes behind the second SNP candidate Neale Hanvey, and his transfers went strongly to Labour to enable Labour to hold their two seats.  Hanvey lost his seat to his running-mate; in the general election next month he will try to recover the Labour seat of Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath.

Again, Allan Faulds of <em>Ballot Box Scotland</em> (whatever would we do without him?) has crunched the numbers to see what would have happened in a single-seat election in 2017; the answer to that is that the SNP would have won Rosyth, but Labour would have won Dunfermline Central thnkss to Conservative transfers.  With the constituency of Dunfermline and West Fife having been close between the SNP and Labour in June 2017, all parties will be looking to make a good impression in these by-elections.

Defending Rosyth for the SNP is Sharon Green-Wilson, who has appeared in this column before: she was the winner of the November 2015 Rosyth by-election, but lost her seat in 2017 to her running-mate Samantha Steele.  Having married since 2017 and changed her surname from Wilson, Sharon will have a better place on the alphabetical ballot paper if she seeks election again in 2022.  This by-election is one of those csses where the candidate list raises an obvious question, and there is a story to be told - which I have regrettably yet to got to the bottom of - regarding the Tory candidate Margaret Fairgrieve.  She gives the same address on her nomination papers as independent candidate Alastair Macintyre, a gardener who returns for his fourth go at Rosyth ward.  Macintyre was the UKIP candidate here in 2012, and in 2017 he polled 2% and finished last of nine candidates.  The Labour candidate can expect to do better than that: he is Billy Pollock, who fought the neighbouring ward of Dunfermline South in 2017.  Also standing in Rosyth are Jill Blair for the Lib Dems, Craig McCutcheon for the Scottish Greens and Calum Paul (from Kirkcaldy) for the Libertarian Party.

The Tories have an uphill task in trying to defend Dunfermline Central from third place.  Their defending candidate is Chloe Dodds, who has appeared in this column before: she was the UKIP candidate in a by-election to Fife council in Dunfermline North ward in November 2015, finishing in last place on that occasion.  The SNP have selected Derek Glen, organiser for the party's Dunfermline branch.  The Labour candidate is Michael Boyd, a former postman and hospital radio presenter who is associated with the GMB union; he fought Dunfermline North ward in 2017.  As with all Scottish local by-elections, Votes at 16 and the Alternative Vote apply, so transfers from whichever of these candidates finishes third could be crucial in the final reckoning.  Also standing are Aude Boubaker-Calder for the Liberal Democrats, Fiona McOwan for the Scottish Greens and Keith Chamberlain for the Libertarian Party.

<h2>Shap</h2>

Eden council, Cumbria; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor John Owen, who had served since 2015.

We travel south of the Border but not very far.  Shap is a place were many pass through but few stop: the A6 road, M6 motorway and West Coast Main Line all go through or past this linear settlement, which is legally a town although the market charter has been dormant for many years.  All of these transport routes pass over the hills to the south on their way to Lancaster: the railway and motorway head south-east towards Tebay and the Lune Gorge, the A6 south-west towards Kendal over the Shap Fells.  This road had a formidable reputation with its sharp curves, steep gradients, high altitude (over 1,400 feet) and propensity for awful weather.  Until the motorway was built, many road travellers from England to western Scotland preferred to avoid the area entirely by travelling via the A1 east of the Pennines as far as Scotch Corner - which is how that road junction got its name.  Shap may have declined a bit since the golden age of motoring, but there is still some accommodation here which is well-used by hikers: the town is a recommended stopping point on Wainwright's Coast to Coast Walk.  With the reduction in passing trade, quarrying is now the major source of income in the Shap ward.  In the 2011 census Shap was in the top 25 wards in England and Wales for those born in the UK (98.7%) and in the top 100 for the White British ethnic group (98.4%).

The Shap district ward also covers the mountainous Shap Fell, and extends as far as the eastern bank of Haweswater.  Not that this increases the electorate, as the villages in Mardale were flooded in the 1930s to supply drinking water for distant Manchester.  Haweswater now supplies around a quarter of United Utilities' water supply.

We're in the Eden local government district here, which doesn't always mean that we get the finest local election results known to humanity.  Eden is an extremely far-flung and - as a look at Shep Fell will tell yuo - very sparesly populated district, and many of its wards go uncontested at election time.  Shap has generally escaped this fate, and some of this will be down to Tory opposition to one man.

Life isn't nice to all of us, and things go wrong.  Unlike most people, Neil Hughes has had the ups and downs of his life played out on national television over the last fifty-six years.  He was one of the fourteen seven-year-old children selected in 1963 by Michael Apted for a documentary series called <em>7 Up</em>, and Apted has returned every seven years since then to film Neil and the twelve other surviving children.  Neil was the only one of the children who went into politics, joining the Liberal Democrats and serving on Hackney council in London in the 1990s.  He subsequently moved to rural Cumbria, and from 2003 to 2015 was the Eden district councillor for Shap ward.  Hughwa was still in that post when the above film was made for <em>56 Up</em> seven years ago; he has since left Eden council after being elected to Cumbria county council in 2013.  Neil still holds that county council seat.  Earlier this year he went through it all again for the benefit of television, participating in <em>63 Up</em>.

Neil Hughes isn't the only person with a compelling life story associated with Shap.  Consider: a successful author, hiker, diplomat, colonial governor, Havard lecturer, TV presenter, Old Etonian, Member of Parliament, Cabinet minister, party leadership candidate, <em>GQ</em> Politician of the Year.  The MP for the local seat of Penrith and the Border until last week, Rory Stewart is or has been all of those things, but he has also been banished from Eden into the political wilderness.  Apparently there's no place for him in the modern Conservative Party.

The Lib Dems didn't put up a candidate for Shap when Hughes retired from Eden council in 2015, and the Conservative candidate John Owen was subsequently elected unopposed.  Owen did face a contest in May this year, when he was re-elected with a 51-31 lead over the Lib Dems.  He had previously been chairman of the council-owned company Heart of Cumbria, but resigned from the board of directors and then the council after the Eden council leadership stripped him of his decision-making powers.

So we have a by-election.  Defending for the Conservatives is Sean Quinn, a volunteer youth worker who gives an address in the village of Kirkby Thore.  The Liberal Democrat candidate is Neil McCall.  Completing the ballot paper is local resident Kerryanne Wilde of the Putting Cumbria First party, who finished in third and last place here in May snd also finished last at a subsequent local by-election in Penrith.
