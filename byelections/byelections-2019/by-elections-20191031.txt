After last week's excitement there are just three local by-elections this week, and they are all on different days.  It's only convention that elections in the UK are normally held on Thursdays; for by-elections any working day will do and we normally get a few by-elections each year which are not on a Thursday (particularly in the City of London).  Before this week the last non-City by-election to be held otherwise than on a Thursday was in Cardiff earlier this year, with Cyncoed division going to the polls on Tuesday 16th July.

Today's Tuesday by-election is in Leamington Spa.  Lillington is Leam's north-eastern ward, based around the Midland Oak at the junction of Lillington Road and Lillington Avenue.  That oak tree, seen here in an old postcard, had stood for centuries and was reputed to mark the centre of England.  The tree in the picture died in the 1960s and was cut down, but one of its acorns was planted in its place in 1988 and is doing well.

The land around the Midland Oak has blossomed with houses.  The old village of Lillington was incorporated into Leamington Spa in the 1890s, and a large council estate was developed here after the Second World War.  At the time of the 2011 census the estate was covered by Crown ward, which sticks out like a sore thumb in the town's census return: it had the highest social housing rates, the highest rate of people with no qualifications, and the youngest population in a town which is made young again each October by Warwick University.  Many of Warwick's students live in Leamington, but Lillington is away from the main bus routes to the campus and not the sort of place where the students live.

Since 2011 Warwick council's ward boundaries have changed twice, the most recent boundary change in May this year merging Crown ward with most of Manor ward to create Lillington ward.  This doesn't vote how you might expect.  Despite its council estate history Crown ward consistently voted Liberal Democrat during this century, while Manor was generally Lib Dem but went Conservative in 2015.  The only previous result for the new Lillington ward was a big Lib Dem win in May this year: their slate polled 48%, against 22% for Labour and 17% for the Conservatives.  There was a similar result in the 2017 Warwickshire county elections for Leamington North division, all of which is within this ward.  The May elections saw the Conservatives lose control of Warwick council, which was the only district in the West Midlands that Remain carried in the June 2016 referendum; however, the Tories are still in control thanks to a coalition with the Whitnash Residents Association.  That coalition holds half of the seats, and a Conservative gain in this by-election will give it a majority.

Daniel Russell defends this by-election for the Liberal Democrats.  Labour have selected Luc Lowndes, who is chairman of the Lillington Community Centre.  The Tory candidate is Hayley Key, who is the manager of a local ski and outdoor leisure shop; she completes a ballot paper of three candidates.

One by-election on Wednesday 30th October 2019:

<h2>Riverside</h2>

Windsor and Maidenhead council, Berkshire; caused by the resignation of the Leader of the Council, Conservative councillor Simon Dudley, who is concentrating on national politics.  He had served since 2007.

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Maidenhead_Bridge_%281%29.jpg/1280px-Maidenhead_Bridge_%281%29.jpg" />

For the second in our three-part series of by-elections this week we are in Maidenhead.  Riverside ward obviously refers to the Thames: it's Maidenhead's north-eastern ward, running north from the Maidenhead Bridge which carries the A4 into town from London.  There has been a bridge on this site since 1280, and that crossing was the making of Maidenhead at a town.  The name was originally Maidenhythe, referring to a "new wharf" which was built next to the bridge to take advantage of that passing trade.  This isn't the only "hythe" on the Thames: the word "hythe" (an Old English term meaning "landing-place") appears in heavily-disguised form some miles downstream in Putney (Putta's landing-place), Chelsea (chalk landing-place), Lambeth (lambs' landing-place), Stepney (Stebba's landing-place) and Rotherhithe (oxen landing-place).

Over the centuries Maidenhead has grown into a prosperous middle-class commuter town and Riverside ward is typical of it.  In 2011 the Maidenhead Riverside ward had almost half of its workforce in upper-middle-class occupation; the population also had a sizeable Asian element and 16% of its residents were born outside the EU.  Rather ironic given that this is the seat held in Parliament by Theresa May, whose ill-advised term as prime minister was preceded by some years as Home Secretary.  Ward boundary changes for the 2019 election removed the "Maidenhead" prefix, a small corner of the ward and one of the three councillors, but it's still basically the same unit.

Mrs May had seen the Tory vote in her constituency grow at both parliamentary and district level since she fended off a "decapitation" attempt from the Lib Dems at the 2005 general election.  In May 2015 the Home Secretary was re-elected with 66% of the vote and the Tories won all but one of the Windsor and Maidenhead council seats in her constituency.  There was a by-election in Maidenhead Riverside ward in March 2016 (<en>Andrew's Previews 2016</em>, page 57) whose result gave the Tories no cause for concern.

That was then, and this is now.  The Conservatives came uncomfortably close to losing their majority on Windsor and Maidenhead council in May this year, finishing with 23 out of 41 seats; rather a drop from 54 out of 57 four years earlier.  The Lib Dems had a resurgence to nine seats, and a variety of minor parties and residents' groups won nine seats between them.  One of those minor parties was a new grouping with the curiously-capitalised name of tBf ("the Borough first"), a localist group which won three seats and came a close second in Riverside ward.  Shares of the vote in this ward were 35% for the Conservative slate, 28% for tBf and 20% for the Liberal Democrats.

So this looks likely to be a much more marginal affair than the March 2016 by-election.  Defending for the Conservatives is Gregory Jones, who runs an estate agency.  tBf have reselected their party leader Claire Stretton, a graphic designer and former Conservative councillor who was runner-up here in May; she previously represented Boyn Hill ward from 2015 to 2019, and before that sat on Wokingham council (for Remenham, Wargrave and Ruscombe ward) from 2008 to 2011.  The Lib Dems have also reselected a candidate from May, Kashmir Singh.  Completing the ballot paper are Craig McDermott for the Green Party, Sharon Bunce for Labour and Deborah Mason for the Women's Equality Party.

<h2>Bromsgrove South</h2>

Worcestershire county council; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Chris Bloore, who is emigrating to Canada.  He had served since 2013.

It's Hallowe'en.  Or Samhain, if you prefer.  Time to make preparations: get the parkin in for Bonfire Night, make sure you have a poppy ready for Remembrance, write up the Christmas present list, dodge the trick-or-treaters and, in my case, get ready for Brexit as your columnist flies to Bulgaria next week for some quiz and sightseeing.  It's Sunday as I write this, and it would be nice to know which immigration queue to head for when I land in Sofia; and whether my EHIC card has any value left given that it's not supposed to expire until 2021.

<img src="https://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/worcs-cc-bromsgrove-s.png" />

There's just one by-election scheduled for today, in Bromsgrove.  This was an old town with a cloth trade in mediaeval times followed by nail-making during the Industrial Revolution.  However, Bromsgrove is not a Black Country town: it's firmly in Worcestershire and separated from the West Midlands conurbation by the Clent Hills.  Rising up the Clent Hills from Bromsgrove is the Lickey Incline, a famously-steep gradient on the railway between Birmingham and Bristol.  Bromsgrove railway station, at the foot of the incline, was rebuilt on a new site in 2016; and it's now enjoying a greatly-improved service as one of the two southern termini of the Cross City line to Birmingham and Lichfield.

Bromsgrove's new railway station lies at the north-east corner of this division and is hopefully attracting some commuters who would previously have gone to work by car.  There's certainly a commuter market if you look at the census return for Stoke Prior, which in the nineteenth century was home to the largest saltworks in Europe but is now a southern extension of Bromsgrove with very high owner-occupation levels.  In nearby Stoke Heath is the Avoncroft Museum of Historic Buildings, an open-air museum where dozens of old and not-so-old buildings have been re-erected.

Bromsgrove has been a Conservative-held parliamentary seat for many years (its current MP is Sajid Javid, the Chancellor of the Exchequer) but the Bromsgrove South county division is a Labour-inclined marginal.  The Tories have won it only once on the current boundaries, in 2009, and that was with a rather low vote share; Labour recovered Bromsgrove South in 2013 and held it in May 2017 with a lead of 50-41 over the Conservatives.  The Bromsgrove council results make clear that the Labour vote comes out of Bromsgrove town with Stoke Prior and Stoke Heath voting Conservative, although the ward boundaries no longer match up following changes at district level in 2015.  Labour performed well here in the 2019 Bromsgrove council elections, making Rock Hall ward safe (it had been marginal in 2015) and coming just one vote short of gaining Aston Fields ward which stayed Conservative by 419 votes to 418.  Never let anybody tell you your vote never changed anything.

Defending this by-election for Labour is Bren Henderson, a stained-glass artist and secretary of the party's Bromsgrove branch.  The Conservatives have selected Kyle Daisley, a 22-year-old Virgin Atlantic flight attendant and parish councillor in Hagley, some miles to the north.  Completing thee ballot paper are Joshua Robinson for the Lib Dems and independent candidate Rachel Jenkins, who was an independent Worcestershire county councillor for Clent Hills division from 2013 to 2017 and sits on Bromsgrove council as an independent councillor for Hagley East ward.

<h2>Election Court Watch</h2>

Since this is a slow week, we've time to note two recent pieces of news from the Courts.  First, we track back to a by-election last year in Upton ward, Wirral council, where it appears that the winning Labour campaign accidentally went over the election expense limit.  The candidate and election agent applied to the courts for relief - essentially, immunity from prosecution - and I assume that they got it.  Losing parties tend not to make a fuss over marginal accidental overspending because they know that the same thing could just as easily happen to them in the future.  Also, while relief may be a get-out-of-jail card it's not a get-out-of-jail-<em>free</em> card; only the High Court has the power to grant relief, so this episode will have landed Wirral Labour with quite a large legal bill in addition to the money they spent on the by-election.

The other piece of legal news is that the Brexit Party have thrown in the towel as regards their legal action from the Peterborough by-election in June.  They have applied to the Election Court to withdraw their election petition and will pay the legal costs for the winning Labour MP and the Returning Officer.  Unfortunately the text of the petition was never made public, so the allegations made remain a mystery to this column.
