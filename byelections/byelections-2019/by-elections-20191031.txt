After last week's excitement there are just three local by-elections this week, and they are all on different days.  It's only convention that elections in the UK are normally held on Thursdays; any working day will do and we normally get a few by-elections each year which are not on a Thursday.

Today's Tuesday by-election is in Leamington Spa.  Lillington is Leam's north-eastern ward, based around the Midland Oak at the junction of Lillington Road and Lillington Avenue.  This oak tree, seen here in an old postcard, had stood for centuries and was reputed to mark the centre of England.  The tree in the picture died in the 1960s and was cut down, but one of its acorns was planted in its place in 1988 and is doing well.  

The land around the Midland Oak has blossomed with houses.  The old village of Lillington was incorporated into Leamington Spa in the 1890s, and a large council estate - the Crown estate - was developed here after the Second World War.  At the time of the 2011 census the Crown estate was covered by Crown ward, which sticks out like a sore thumb in the town's census return: it had the highest social housing rates, the highest rate of people with no qualifications, and the youngest population in a town made young again each October by Warwick University.  Many of Warwick's students live in Leamington, but Lillington is away from the main bus routes to the campus and not the sort of place where the students live.

Since 2011 Warwick council's ward boundaries have changed twice, the most recent boundary change in May this year merging Crown ward with most of Manor ward to create Lillington ward.  This doesn't vote how you might expect.  Despite its council estate history Crown ward consistently voted Liberal Democrat during this century, while Manor was generally Lib Dem but went Conservative in 2015.  The only previous result for the new Lillington ward was a big Lib Dem win in May this year: their slate polled 48%, against 22% for Labour and 17% for the Conservatives.  There was a similar result in the 2017 Warwickshire county elections for Leamington North division, all of which is within this ward.  The May elections saw the Conservatives lose control of Warwick council, which was the only district in the West Midlands that Remain carried in the June 2016 referendum; however, the Toties are still in control thanks to a coalition with the Whitnash Residents Association, that coalition holding half of the seats.

Daniel Russell defends this by-election for the Liberal Democrats.  Labour have selected Luc Lowndes, who is chairman of the Lillington Community Centre.  The Tory candidate is Hayley Key, who is the manager of a local ski and outdoor leisure shop; she completes a ballot paper of three candidates.

One by-election on Wednesday 30th October 2019:

<h2>Riverside</h2>

Windsor and Maidenhead council, Berkshire; caused by the resignation of the Leader of the Council, Conservative councillor Simon Dudley, who is concentrating on national politics.  He had served since 2007.

For the second in our three-part series of by-elections this week we are in Maidenhead.  Riverside ward obviously refers to the Thames: it's Maidenhead's north-eastern ward, running north from the Maidenhead Bridge which carries the A4 into town from London.  There has been a bridge on this site since 1280, and that crossing was the making of Maidenhead at a town: the name was originally Maidenhythe, referring to a "new wharf" which was built next to the bridge to take advantage of the passing trade.  This isn't the only "hythe" on the Thames: the word "hythe" (an Old English term meaning "landing-place") appears in heavily-disguised form some miles downstream in Putney (Putta's landing-place), Chelsea (chalk landing-place), Lambeth (lambs' landing-place), Stepney (Stebba's landing-place) and Rotherhithe (ox landing-place).

Over the centuries Maidenhead has grown into a prosperous middle-class commuter town and Riverside ward is typical of it.  In 2011 the Maidenhead Riverside ward had almost half of its workforce in upper-middle-class occupation; the population also had a sizeable Asian elemntt and 16% of its residents were born outside the EU.  Rather ironic given that this is the seat held in Parliament by Theresa May, whose ill-advised term as prime minister was preceded by sone years as Home Secretary.  Ward boundary changes for the 2019 election removed the "Maidenhead" prefix, a small corner of the ward and one of the three councillors, but it's still basically the same unit.

Mrs May had seen the Tory vote in her constituency grow at both parliamentary and district level since she saw off a "decapitation" attempt from the Lib Dems at the 2005 general election.  In May 2015 the Home Secretary was re-elected with 66% of the vote in her constituency and the Tories won all but one of the Windsor and Maidenhead council seats here: one of the two seats in Pinkneys Green ward was the one that got away.  There was a by-election in Maidenhead Riverside ward in March 2016 (<en>Andrew's Previews 2016</em>, page 57) whose result gave the Tories no cause for concern.

That was then, and this is now.  The Conservatives came uncomfortably close to losing their majority on Windsor and Maidenhead council in May this year, finishing with 23 out of 41 seats; rather a drop from 54 out of 57 four years earlier.  The Lib Dems had a resurgence to nine saets, and a variety of minor parties and residents' groups won nine seats between them.  One of those minor parties was a new grouping with the curiously-capitalised name of tBf ("the Borough first"), a localist group which won three seats and came a close second in Riverside ward.  Shares of the vote were 35% for the Conservative slate, 28% for tBf and 20% for the Liberal Democrats.

So this looks likely to be a much more marginal affair than the March 2016 by-election.  Defending for the Conservatives is Gregory Jones, who runs an estate agency.  tBf have reselected their party leader Claire Stretton, a graphic designer and former Conservative councillor who was runner-up here in May; she previously represented Boyn Hill ward from 2015 to 2019, and before that sat on Wokingham council (for Remenham, Wargrave and Ruscombe ward) from 2008 to 2011.  The Lib Dems have also reselected a candidate from May, Kashmir Singh.  Completing the ballot paper are Craig McDermott for the Green Party, Sharon Bunce for Labour and Deborah Mason for the Women's Equality Party.

One by-election on Thursday 30th October 2019:

<hr/>

<h2>Bromsgrove South</h2>

Worcestershire county council; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Chris Bloore, who is emigrating to Canada.  He had served since 2013.

It's Hallowe'en.  Or Samhain, if you prefer.  Time to get the parkin in, make sure you have a poppy ready, dodge the trick-or-treaters and, in my case, get ready for Brexit; your columnist flies to Bulgaria next week for some quiz and sightseeing.  It would be nice to know which immigration queue to head for when I land in Sofia, and whether my EHIC card has any value left given that it's not supposed to expire until 2021.

There's just one by-election scheduled for today, in Bromsgrove.  This was an old town with a cloth trade in mediaeval times followed by nail-making during the Industrial Revolution.  Bromsgrove is at the bottom of the Lickey Incline, a famously-steep gradient on the railway between Birmingham and Bristol; the town's railway station was rebuilt in 2016 and is now enjoying a greatly-improved service as one of the two southern termini of the Cross City line to Birmingham and Lichfield.

Bromsgrove's new railway station lies at the north-east corner of this division and is hopefully attracting some commuters who would previously have gone to work by car.  There's certainly a commuter market if you look at the census return for Stoke Prior, which in the nineteenth century was home to the largest saltworks in Europe but is now a souhern extension of Bromsgrove with very high owner-occupation levels.  In nearby Stoke Heath is the Avoncroft Museum of Historic Buildings, an open-air museum where dozens of old buildings have been re-erected.

Bromsgrove has been a Conservative-held parliamentary seat for many years (its current MP is Sajid Javid, the Chancellor of the Exchequer) but the Bromsgrove South county division is a Labour-inclined marginal.  The Tories have won it only once on the current boundaries, in 2009, and that was with a rather low vote share; Labour recovered Bromsgrove South in 2013 and held it in May 2017 with a lead of 50-41 over the Conservatives.  The Bromsgrove council results make clear that the Labour vote comes out of Bromsgrove town with Stoke Prior and Stoke Heath voting Conservative, although the ward boundaries no longer match up following changes at district level in 2015.  Labour performed well here in the 2019 Bromsgrove council elections, making Rock Hall ward safe (it had been marginal in 2015) and coming just one vote short of gaining Aston Fields ward which stayed Conservative by 419 votes to 418.  Never let anybody tell you your vote never changed anything.

Defending this by-election for Labour is Bren Henderson, a stained-glass artist and secretary of the party's Bromsgrove branch.  The Conservatives have selected Kyle Daisley, a 22-year-old Virgin Atlantic flight attendant and parish councillor in Hagley.  Completing thee ballot paper are Joshua Robinson for the Lib Dems and independent candidate Rachel Jenkins, who was an independent Worcestershire county councillor for Clent Hills division from 2013 to 2017 and sits on Bromsgrove council as an independent councillor for Hagley East ward.
