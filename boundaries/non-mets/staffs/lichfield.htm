<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE
</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
This Order gives effect, subject to one modification, to recommendations by the Local Government Commission for England for electoral changes in the district of Lichfield. The changes have effect in relation to local government elections to be held on and after 1st May 2003.<BR><BR>
The modification relates to the name of one of the parish wards of the city of Lichfield. The Secretary of State has decided that the city ward for which the Commission proposed the name "Boley" shall bear the name "Boley Park".<BR><BR>
Article 2 abolishes the existing wards of the district and provides for the creation of 26 new wards. That article and Schedule 1 also make provision for the names and areas of, and numbers of councillors for, the new wards.<BR><BR>
Articles 3 to 7 make electoral changes in the parishes of Burntwood, Drayton Bassett, Hammerwich, the city of Lichfield and the parish of Longdon.<BR><BR>
Article 8 revokes the District of Lichfield (Electoral Arrangements) Order 1976.<BR><BR>
The areas of the new district and parish wards are demarcated on the map described in article 1(3). Prints of the map may be inspected at all reasonable times at the offices of Lichfield District Council and at the offices of the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, 2nd Floor, Ashdown House, 123 Victoria Street, London SW1E 6DE.<BR><BR>
