</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
This Order gives effect, with modifications, to recommendations by the Boundary Committee for England, a committee of the Electoral Commission, for electoral changes in the county of Staffordshire.<BR><BR>
The modifications concern the boundary between Gnosall and Doxey, and Stafford North electoral divisions and the names of Gnosall and Doxey, Stone Rural and Stone Urban electoral divisions.<BR><BR>
The changes have effect in relation to local government elections to be held on and after the ordinary day of election of councillors in 2005.<BR><BR>
Article 3 abolishes the existing electoral divisions of the county and provides for the creation of 59 new electoral divisions. That article and the Schedule also make provision for the names and areas of, and numbers of councillors for, the new electoral divisions.<BR><BR>
Article 4 makes electoral changes in the parish of Rugeley.<BR><BR>
Article 6 obliges the Electoral Registration Officer in each district or borough in the county of Staffordshire to make any necessary amendments to the electoral register for that district or borough to reflect the new electoral arrangements.<BR><BR>
Article 7 revokes the County of Staffordshire (Electoral Arrangements) Order 1980, with the exception of article 5.<BR><BR>
The areas of the new electoral divisions and parish wards are demarcated on the map described in article 2. Prints of the map may be inspected at all reasonable times at the offices of Staffordshire County Council and at the principal office of the Electoral Commission at Trevelyan House, Great Peter Street, London SW1P 2HW.<BR><BR>
