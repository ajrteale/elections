<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE
</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
This Order provides for a new scheme for elections of councillors in each of the districts of Cheltenham, Fareham, Gosport, Hastings, Nuneaton and Bedworth, and Oxford.<BR><BR>
Under the new scheme the term of office of councillors is four years, except for the councillors who retire in 2004 after a two year term. Elections are to be held in 2004 and biennially thereafter. One half (or as nearly as may be) of the councillors are elected in each year in which the elections are held (article 3).<BR><BR>
The parishes within Cheltenham and Oxford are to have parish council elections in 2003 to tie in with the ward changes taking place in some of those parishes in 2003. Subsequent parish council elections shall be in 2006, instead of 2007, and every fourth year after 2006, so that they take place in the same year as district council elections (article 4).<BR><BR>
Article 5 makes provision for the retirement of parish councillors.<BR><BR>
Article 6 revokes provisions in the following Orders which have been superseded by the provisions of this Order:<BR><BR>
<UL>
the Borough of Cheltenham (Electoral Changes) Order 2001;</UL><P>
<UL>
the Borough of Fareham (Electoral Changes) Order 2001;</UL><P>
