</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
This Order gives effect to recommendations by the Local Government Commission for England for electoral changes in the city of Winchester. The changes have effect in relation to local government elections to be held on and after 2nd May 2002.<BR><BR>
Article 2 abolishes the existing wards of the city and provides for the creation of twenty-six new wards. That article and Schedule 1 also make provision for the names and areas of, and numbers of councillors for, the new wards.<BR><BR>
Article 3 makes provision for a whole council election in 2002 and for reversion to elections by thirds in subsequent years. Schedule 2 regulates the order of retirement of councillors.<BR><BR>
Articles 4 to 6 make electoral changes in the parishes of Bishops Waltham, Soberton, Swanmore and Wickham.<BR><BR>
Article 7 provides for elections of parish councillors for certain parish councils in the city.<BR><BR>
Article 8 revokes the City of Winchester (Electoral Arrangements) Order 1976 and article 15 of the Winchester (Parishes) Order 1985.<BR><BR>
The areas of the new city wards are demarcated on the map described in article 1(4). Prints of the map may be inspected at all reasonable times at the offices of Winchester City Council and at the offices of the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, 2nd Floor, Ashdown House, 123 Victoria Street, London SW1E 6DE.<BR><BR>
