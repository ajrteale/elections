<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE
</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
This Order gives effect, subject to modifications, to recommendations by the Local Government Commission for England for electoral changes in the borough of Basingstoke and Deane. The changes have effect in relation to local government elections to be held on and after 2nd May 2002.<BR><BR>
The modifications relate to the name of one of the proposed new wards and to boundaries of some of the wards. The Secretary of State has decided that the ward for which the Commission suggested the name "Laverstoke, Overton and Steventon" should be called "Overton, Laverstoke and Steventon"; that the whole of the Brighton Hill Centre should be in the borough ward of Brighton Hill North; and that the boundary between the borough wards of Calleva and Sherborne St John should follow the railway line.<BR><BR>
Article 2 abolishes the existing wards of the borough and provides for the creation of 30 new wards. That article and Schedule 1 also make provision for the names and areas of, and numbers of councillors for, the new wards.<BR><BR>
Article 3 makes provision for a whole council election in 2002 and for reversion to elections by thirds in subsequent years. Schedule 2 regulates the order of retirement of councillors.<BR><BR>
Articles 4 to 7 make electoral changes in the parishes of Bramley, Dummer, Sherborne St John and Sherfield on Loddon.<BR><BR>
Article 8 provides for elections of parish councillors in the borough.<BR><BR>
Article 9 revokes the Borough of Basingstoke and Deane (Electoral Arrangements) Order 1992 and the District of Basingstoke (Electoral Arrangements) Order 1975.<BR><BR>
The areas of the new borough and parish wards are demarcated on the map described in article 1(5). Prints of the map may be inspected at all reasonable times at the offices of Basingstoke and Deane Borough Council and at the offices of the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, 2nd Floor, Ashdown House, 123 Victoria Street, London SW1E 6DE.<BR><BR>
