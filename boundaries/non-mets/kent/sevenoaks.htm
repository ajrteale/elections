</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
This Order gives effect, with modifications, to recommendations by the Local Government Commission for England for electoral changes in the district of Sevenoaks. The changes have effect in relation to local government elections to be held on and after 1st May 2003.<BR><BR>
The modifications relate to the name of a district ward, the names of the parish wards in the parish of Edenbridge, an increase in the number of parish councillors for the parish of Sevenoaks and a boundary change.<BR><BR>
The Secretary of State has decided that the district ward for which the Commission suggested the name "West Kingsdown and Fawkham" should be called "Fawkham and West Kingsdown". The parish wards for which the Commission suggested the name "Edenbridge North" and "Edenbridge South" should be called "Edenbridge North and East" and "Edenbridge South and West" respectively. The Secretary of State has also decided that the number of parish councillors for the parish ward of Sevenoaks Eastern should be increased from two councillors to three councillors. The modification is to the boundary between the Crockenhill and Well Hill Ward and the Otford and Shoreham Ward. A small area to the east of the M25 has been transferred from the Otford and Shoreham Ward to the Crockenhill and Well Hill Ward.<BR><BR>
Article 2 abolishes the existing wards of the district and provides for the creation of 26 new wards. That article and Schedule 1 also make provision for the names and areas of, and numbers of councillors for, the new wards.<BR><BR>
Article 3 provides for the election of all councillors of the district of Sevenoaks to take place in 2003 and every 4 years after that year.<BR><BR>
Articles 4 to 9 make electoral changes in the parishes of Chiddingstone, Edenbridge, Sevenoaks, Shoreham, Swanley, Eynsford and Hartley.<BR><BR>
Article 10 revokes the District of Sevenoaks (Electoral Arrangements) Order 1976.<BR><BR>
The areas of the new district and parish wards are demarcated on the map described in article 1(3). Prints of the map may be inspected at all reasonable times at the offices of Sevenoaks District Council and at the offices of the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions, 2nd Floor, Ashdown House, 123 Victoria Street, London SW1E 6DE.<BR><BR>
