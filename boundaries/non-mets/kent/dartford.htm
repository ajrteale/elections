This Order gives effect subject to one modification, to recommendations by the Local Government Commission for England for electoral changes in the borough of Dartford. The changes have effect in relation to local government elections to be held on and after 1st May 2003.<BR><BR>
The modification is that the Secretary of State has decided that the Swanscombe Centre is transferred from the Knockhall Ward to the Galley Hill Ward.<BR><BR>
Article 2 abolishes the existing wards of the borough and provides for the creation of 17 new wards. That article and Schedule 1 also make provision for the names and areas of, and numbers of councillors for, the new wards.<BR><BR>
Article 3 provides for the election of all councillors of the borough of Dartford to take place in 2003 and every 4 years after that year.<BR><BR>
Articles 4 to 7 make electoral changes in the parishes of Darenth, Stone, Swanscombe and Greenhithe, and Wilmington.<BR><BR>
Article 8 revokes the District of Dartford (Electoral Arrangements) Order 1975.<BR><BR>
The areas of the new borough and parish wards are demarcated on the map described in article 1(3). Prints of the map may be inspected at all reasonable times at the office of Dartford Borough Council and at the office of the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions, 2nd Floor, Ashdown House, 123 Victoria Street, London SW1E 6DE.<BR><BR>
