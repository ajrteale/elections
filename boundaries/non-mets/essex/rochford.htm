(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
This Order gives effect to recommendations by the Local Government Commission for England for electoral changes in the district of Rochford.<BR><BR>
Article 2 abolishes the existing wards of the district and provides for the creation of nineteen new wards. That article and Schedule 1 also make provision for the names and areas of, and numbers of councillors for, the new wards.<BR><BR>
Article 3 makes provision for a whole council election in 2002 and for reversion to elections by thirds in subsequent years. Schedule 2 regulates the order of retirement of councillors.<BR><BR>
Articles 4 to 9 make electoral changes in the parishes of Ashingdon, Great Wakering, Hawkwell, Hockley, Rayleigh and Rochford.<BR><BR>
Article 10 provides for elections of parish councillors for the parishes of Hockley, Hullbridge and Rochford in the district.<BR><BR>
Article 11 revokes the District of Rochford (Electoral Arrangements) Order 1975.<BR><BR>
The areas of the new district and parish wards are demarcated on the map described in article 1(3). Prints of the map may be inspected at all reasonable times at the offices of Rochford District Council and at the offices of the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions, 2nd Floor, Ashdown House, 123 Victoria Street, London SW1E 6DE.<BR><BR>
