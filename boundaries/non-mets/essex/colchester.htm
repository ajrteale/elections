</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
This Order gives effect to recommendations by the Local Government Commission for England for electoral changes in the borough of Colchester. The changes have effect in relation to local government elections to be held on and after 2nd May 2002.<BR><BR>
The modification relates to boundaries of some of the proposed new wards. The Secretary of State has decided that the area known as Bell House Pit will be moved from the Copford and West Stanway ward to the Stanway ward.<BR><BR>
Article 2 abolishes the existing wards of the borough and provides for the creation of 27 new wards. That article and Schedule 1 also make provision for the names and areas of, and numbers of councillors for, the new wards.<BR><BR>
Article 3 makes provision for a whole council election in 2002 and for reversion to elections by thirds in subsequent years. Schedule 2 regulates the order of retirement of councillors.<BR><BR>
Article 4 to 7 make electoral changes in the parishes of Myland, Stanway, Tiptree and Wivenhoe.<BR><BR>
Article 8 provides for elections of parish councillors for certain parishes in the borough.<BR><BR>
Article 9 revokes the Borough of Colchester (Electoral Arrangements) Order 1975 and the Borough of Colchester (Electoral Arrangements) Order 1989.<BR><BR>
The areas of the new borough and parish wards are demarcated on the map described in article 1(3). Prints of the map may be inspected at all reasonable times at the offices of Colchester Borough Council and at the offices of the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions, 2nd Floor, Ashdown House, 123 Victoria Street, London SW1E 6DE.<BR><BR>
