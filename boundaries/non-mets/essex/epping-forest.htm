<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE
</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
This Order gives effect, with one modification, to recommendations by the Local Government Commission for England for electoral changes in the district of Epping Forest. The changes have effect in relation to local government elections to be held on and after 2nd May 2002. The modification relates to the name of one of the proposed new wards. The Secretary of State has decided that the district and parish ward for which the Commission suggested the name "Honey Lane" should be called "Waltham Abbey Honey Lane".<BR><BR>
Article 2 abolishes the existing wards of the district and provides for the creation of 32 new wards. That article and Schedule 1 also make provision for the names and areas of, and numbers of councillors for, the new wards.<BR><BR>
Article 3 makes provision for a whole council election in 2002 and for reversion to elections by thirds in subsequent years. Schedule 2 regulates the order of retirement of councillors.<BR><BR>
Articles 4 to 9 make electoral changes in the parishes of Chigwell, Epping, Loughton, Ongar, Sheering and Waltham Abbey.<BR><BR>
Article 10 provides for elections of parish councillors for certain parishes in the district.<BR><BR>
Article 11 revokes the District of Epping Forest (Electoral Arrangements) Order 1977.<BR><BR>
The areas of the new district and parish wards are demarcated on the map described in article 1(3). Prints of the map may be inspected at all reasonable times at the offices of Epping Forest District council and at the offices of the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions, 2nd Floor, Ashdown House, 123 Victoria Street, London SW1E 6DE.<BR><BR>
