<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE
</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
This Order gives effect to recommendations by the Local Government Commission for England for electoral changes in the borough of Brentwood. The changes have effect in relation to local government elections to be held on and after 2nd May 2002. The modification relates to the name of one of the proposed new wards. The Secretary of State has decided that the ward for which the Commission suggested the name "Blackmore and Stondon Massey" should be called "Tipps Cross".<BR><BR>
Article 2 abolishes the existing wards of the borough and provides for the creation of 15 new wards. That article and Schedule 1 also make provision for the names and areas of, and numbers of councillors for, the new wards.<BR><BR>
Article 3 makes provision for a whole council election in 2002 and for reversion to elections by thirds in subsequent years. Schedule 2 regulates the order of retirement of councillors.<BR><BR>
Article 4 provides for elections of parish councillors for parishes in the borough.<BR><BR>
Article 5 revokes the District of Brentwood (Electoral Arrangements) Order 1975.<BR><BR>
The areas of the new borough wards are demarcated on the map described in article 1(3). Prints of the map may be inspected at all reasonable times at the offices of Brentwood Borough Council and at the offices of the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions, 2nd Floor, Ashdown House, 123 Victoria Street, London SW1E 6DE.<BR><BR>
