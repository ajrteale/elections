</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
This Order gives effect, subject to modifications, to recommendations by the Local Government Commission for England for electoral changes in the borough of Chelmsford. The changes have effect in relation to local government elections to be held on and after 1st May 2003.<BR><BR>
The modifications relate to boundaries of some of the proposed new wards. The Secretary of State has decided that the areas of Pitfield, Millers Croft and Roberts Court shall be moved into the Great Baddow East Borough Ward and the area of Hanlee Brook shall be moved into the Great Baddow West Borough Ward.<BR><BR>
Article 2 abolishes the existing wards of the borough and provides for the creation of 24 new wards. That article and the Schedule also make provision for the names and areas of, and numbers of councillors for, the new wards.<BR><BR>
Article 3 provides for the election of all councillors of the borough of Chelmsford to take place in 2003 and every 4 years after that year.<BR><BR>
Articles 4 to 6 make electoral changes to the parishes of Great Baddow, Springfield, South Hanningfield, South Woodham Ferrers and Writtle.<BR><BR>
Article 7 revokes the Borough of Chelmsford (Electoral Arrangements) Order 1975 and the Borough of Chelmsford (Electoral Arrangements) Order 1987, and article 6(3) of the Chelmsford (Parishes) Order 1987.<BR><BR>
The areas of the new borough and parish wards are demarcated on the map described in article 1(3). Prints of the map may be inspected at all reasonable times at the offices of Chelmsford Borough Council and at the offices of the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions, 2nd Floor, Ashdown House, 123 Victoria Street, London SW1E 6DE.<BR><BR>
