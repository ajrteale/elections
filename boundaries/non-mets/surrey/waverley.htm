</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
This Order gives effect, subject to the modifications detailed below, to recommendations by the Local Government Commission for England for electoral changes in the borough of Waverley. The changes have effect in relation to local government elections to be held on and after 1st May 2003.<BR><BR>
The modifications concern the ward names of four borough, and parish, wards in Farnham. The proposed Farnham Monks, Farnham College, Farnham Wrecclesham East and Boundstone, and Farnham Wrecclesham West and Rowledge wards have been modified to Farnham Moor Park, Farnham Firgrove, Farnham Shortheath and Boundstone, and Farnham Wrecclesham and Rowledge respectively.<BR><BR>
Article 2 abolishes the existing wards of the borough and provides for the creation of 29 new wards. That article and Schedule 1 also make provision for the names and areas of, and numbers of councillors for, the new wards.<BR><BR>
Articles 3 to 7 make electoral changes in the parishes of Cranleigh, Ewhurst, Farnham, Godalming and Haslemere. Article 8 and Schedule 2 make electoral changes in the parish of Witley.<BR><BR>
Article 9 revokes the Borough of Waverley (Electoral Arrangements) Order 1979.<BR><BR>
The areas of the new borough wards are demarcated on the map described in article 1(3). Prints of the map may be inspected at all reasonable times at the offices of the Waverley Borough Council and at the offices of the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, 2nd Floor, Ashdown House, 123 Victoria Street, London SW1E 6DE.<BR><BR>
