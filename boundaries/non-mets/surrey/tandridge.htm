<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE
</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
This Order gives effect, subject to a modification, to recommendations by the Local Government Commission for England for electoral changes in the district of Tandridge.<BR><BR>
The modification is a consequence of a parish review conducted by Tandridge District Council. The Local Government Commission had proposed new warding arrangements for the parish of Lingfield and Dormansland, whereas the District Council's proposal, which the Secretary of State has accepted, was that the parish should be split into two new parishes. The new parishes of Dormansland and Lingfield are constituted by article 3 of the Tandridge (Parishes) Order 1999 (S.I. 1999/2347).<BR><BR>
Article 2 abolishes all of the existing wards of the district and provides for the creation of 20 new wards. That article and Schedule 1 also make provision for the names and areas of, and numbers of councillors for, the new wards.<BR><BR>
Article 3 makes provision for a whole council election in Tandridge in 2000 and reversion to elections by thirds in subsequent years. Schedule 2 regulates the order of retirement of councillors.<BR><BR>
Article 4 revokes the District of Tandridge (Electoral Arrangements) Order 1975.<BR><BR>
