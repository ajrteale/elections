--README--

These are the legal orders which defined boundaries of electoral divisions in the Welsh local elections of 1995.

The orders for the following councils were downloaded from the Welsh Government's online publications catalogue:

- Aberconwy and Colwyn
- Blaenau Gwent
- Caernarfonshire and Merionethshire
- Denbighshire
- Merthyr Tydfil
- Monmouthshire
- Neath and Port Talbot
- Powys
- Rhondda, Cynon, Taff
- Swansea

Copies of the orders for the remaining councils were kindly supplied by the Welsh Government's Information and Archive Services, to whom I am grateful.
