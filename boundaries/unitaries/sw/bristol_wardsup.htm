<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE
</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
This Order gives effect subject to a modification to the boundary between the wards of Easton and Lockleaze, to recommendations by the Local Government Commission for England for electoral changes in the city of Bristol.<BR><BR>
Article 2 abolishes all of the existing wards of the city and provides for the creation of 35 new wards. That article and Schedule 1 also make provision for the names and areas of, and numbers of councillors for, the new wards.<BR><BR>
Article 3 makes provision for a whole council election in Bristol in 1999 and for reversion to elections by thirds in subsequent years. That article and Schedule 2 provide for the order of retirement of councillors.<BR><BR>
Article 4 revokes the City of Bristol (Electoral Arrangements) Order 1980 and article 8 of the Avon (Structural Change) Order 1995.<BR><BR>
The areas of the new city wards are demarcated on the map described in article 1(3). Prints of the map may be inspected at all reasonable times at the offices of Bristol City Council and at the offices of the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions which are located at 2nd Floor, Ashdown House, 123 Victoria Street, London SW1E 6DE.<BR><BR>
