This Order gives effect to recommendations by the Local Government Commission for England for electoral changes in the borough of Swindon.<BR><BR>

Article 3 makes provision for a whole council election in Swindon in 2000 and reversion to elections by thirds in subsequent years. Schedule 2 regulates the order of retirement of councillors.<BR><BR>
Articles 4 to 7 make electoral changes in the parishes of Blunsdon St Andrew, Chiseldon, Haydon Wick and Stratton St Margaret.<BR><BR>
Article 8 makes provision for parish elections.<BR><BR>
Article 9 revokes the Borough of Thamesdown (Electoral Arrangements) Order 1975 and the Borough of Thamesdown (Electoral Arrangements) Order 1986 and Part III of the Wiltshire (Borough of Thamesdown) (Structural Change) Order 1995.<BR><BR>
