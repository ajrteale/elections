<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE
</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
This Order gives effect, with modifications, to recommendations by the Boundary Committee for England, a committee of the Electoral Commission, for electoral changes in the county of Kent.<BR><BR>
The modifications concern the names of Broadstairs and Sir Moses Montefiore, Northfleet and Gravesend West, and Tunbridge Wells Rural electoral divisions.<BR><BR>
The changes have effect in relation to local government elections to be held on and after the ordinary day of election of councillors in 2005.<BR><BR>
Article 3 abolishes the existing electoral divisions of the county and provides for the creation of 72 new electoral divisions. That article and the Schedule also make provision for the names and areas of, and numbers of councillors for, the new electoral divisions.<BR><BR>
Article 5 obliges the Electoral Registration Officer in each district, borough or city in the county of Kent to make any necessary amendments to the electoral register for that district, borough or city to reflect the new electoral arrangements.<BR><BR>
Article 6 revokes the County of Kent (Electoral Arrangements) Order 1981, with the exception of article 4.<BR><BR>
The areas of the new electoral divisions are demarcated on the map described in article 2. Prints of the map may be inspected at all reasonable times at the offices of Kent County Council and at the principal office of the Electoral Commission at Trevelyan House, Great Peter Street, London SW1P 2HW.<BR><BR>
