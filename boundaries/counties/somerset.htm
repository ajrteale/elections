This Order gives effect, with one modification, to recommendations by
the Local Government Commission for England for electoral changes in

for the creation of 58 new divisions. That article and Schedule 1 also
make provision for the names and areas of the new divisions. One
councillor is to be elected for each division.<br><br>
Articles 3 and 4 make electoral changes in the parishes of Frome and
Burnham-on-Sea and Highbridge. The changes have effect in relation to
local government elections to be held on or after 1st May 2003.<br><br>
Article 5 revokes the County of Somerset (Electoral Arrangements) Order
1980, article 3 of the District of Mendip (Electoral Changes) Order
1998 and article 3 of the District of Sedgemoor (Electoral Changes)
Order 1998.<br><br>
