<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE
</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
This Order gives effect, with modifications, to recommendations by the Boundary Committee for England, a committee of the Electoral Commission, for electoral changes in the county of Lancashire.<BR><BR>
The modifications concern the names of Accrington West, Brierfield and Nelson North, Longridge with Bowland, Nelson South, Pendle Central, and Rishton and Clayton-le-Moors electoral divisions, and the boundary between Burnley Central West and Burnley South West electoral divisions.<BR><BR>
The changes have effect in relation to local government elections to be held on and after the ordinary day of election of councillors in 2005.<BR><BR>
Article 3 abolishes the existing electoral divisions of the county and provides for the creation of 84 new electoral divisions. That article and the Schedule also make provision for the names and areas of, and numbers of councillors for, the new electoral divisions.<BR><BR>
Article 5 obliges the Electoral Registration Officer for each district, borough or city in the county of Lancashire to make any necessary amendments to the electoral register to reflect the new electoral arrangements.<BR><BR>
