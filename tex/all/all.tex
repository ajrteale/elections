% Elections were held on 6th May 2010 to all London boroughs and metropolitan boroughs, and some unitary authorities and shire districts in England. These elections were combined with a general election which was held on the same day. 
%
% The voting system used for all elections covered here was
% first-past-the-post, with multi-member FPTP being used where more than
% one seat was up for election. 
% 
%The results of the general election are shown in Part I. The information in Part I is taken from the Electoral Commission.
%
% All of the seats on the 32 London borough councils were up for election. The vast majority of London boroughs use multi-member wards electing three councillors each; there are also a handful of single-member and two-member wards. Elections to the London boroughs are covered in Part~II, which has been split into two chapters (North and South London).
% 
% The 36 metropolitan boroughs are all elected by thirds. Each ward has
% three councillors, with the winning councillor from the 2006 election being up for
% election in each ward. In some cases two seats were up for election,
% due to the death or resignation of another councillor for the ward
% within six months of the election. Results of these elections are
% contained in Part~III, which each of the former metropolitan counties
% constituting a separate chapter.
% 
% The English unitary authorities and shire districts may have up to
% three councillors in each ward, and may hold elections either all at
% once or by thirds. 
% Only those councils which elect by thirds held
% elections this year; those councils which elect all at once were
% last elected in 2007 and will next be elected in 2011. A few
% districts elect by halves every two years; all of these districts held
% an election this year. Where districts elect by thirds generally not
% all of the wards in the district hold an election every year. A full explanation of the electoral arrangements is
% given at the head of each council's entry.
%
% Due to a botched attempt at local government reorganisation, the 2010 elections to Exeter and Norwich city councils were held on 9th September. It had originally been intended to change these councils to unitary status, which resulted in the scheduled 2010 elections to these councils being cancelled with the intention that the first elections to the new unitary councils would take place in 2011, the councillors elected in 2006 to have their terms extended until 2011. However, when the unitary plans were abandoned by the coalition government following the general election, the High Court ruled that the councillors elected in 2006 had come to the end of their four-year term and could no longer continue in office.
% 
% Unitary election results are shown in Part~IV 
% with shire district results in Part~V. Part~IV is
% divided into eight chapters based on region, while Part~V has one
% chapter for each county.
% 
% For the first time in this series, referendums (Part VI) and by-elections (Part VII) held in 2010 are also included. Scottish local by-elections are held using the Alternative Vote; while details of transfers are shown, for reasons of space some elimination stages have been omitted.
% 
% Finally, at the back you will find an Index of Wards.
% 
% Where a candidate in an election dies, the election in that ward or division is
% cancelled and rearranged for a later date. This happened in the
% following wards or divisions at this election:
