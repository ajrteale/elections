After a pause for Jubilee week, we now move into a traditionally busy time of year for by-elections, as local parties try to get vacancies filled before the summer holiday season.  Six by-elections this week makes it the busiest night since the May elections.  The Conservatives are defending three wards in the Home Counties and one in rural Northamptonshire, and there is a Labour defence in Greater Manchester.  But first up in this preview we head to mid-Wales for a bit of unfinished business from May.

BRYN-CRUG/LLANFIHANGEL, Gwynedd county council; caused by no candidates being nominated for the ordinary election in May.  The ward's previous independent councillor Richard Arwel Pierce unexpectedly decided not to seek re-election this year; unaware of this, no-one was planning to oppose him.

This is a rugged corner of Merioneth entirely within the Snowdonia National Park, running north-east from the coastal town of Tywyn up the Dysynni valley.  At the south-west end of the ward is the village of Bryncrug just outside Tywyn, probably the largest settlement within the ward.  The ward then runs north-east into the mountains following the road to Abergynolwyn; parallel to this is the narrow-gauge Talyllyn Railway, one of the 'Great Little Trains of Wales', built in the 1860s to serve the Bryn Eglwys slate quarry in the hills and operated since 1951 (after the closure of the quarry) as a tourist attraction.  

Also built to serve the quarry was the village of Abergynolwyn which has overtaken the older Llanfihangel-y-Pennant as the main settlement in the mountainous part of the ward; Llanfihangel-y-Pennant is famous for being the village from which in 1800 Mary Jones walked 25 miles to Bala in order to buy a Bible.  Further up is Tal-y-llyn Lake below the ward's highest point, the mountain of Cadair Idris.  You may have seen Tal-y-llyn Lake without realising it:

This by-election could have been crucial for control of Gwynedd council, as despite a strong effort Plaid Cymru failed to eliminate the Llais Gwynedd thorn in their side.  Plaid finished up in May one seat short of an overall majority which a win in this by-election could deliver for them; however Plaid decided to form the administration as a coalition with Labour, giving a healthy majority on Gwynedd council.  Plaid had spent most of the last term as a minority administration and presumably didn't wish to repeat the experience.

Richard Arwel Pierce was elected unopposed in 2008 and 2004, and presumably would have been so this year had he decided to seek re-election.  So there is absolutely no information to go on in terms of previous election results in the ward when trying to predict the result of the by-election, for which five candidates have come out of the woodwork.  The administration's candidate is Alun Evans of Plaid Cymru, who lost his seat in May in the neighbouring Tywyn ward.  The other official party candidate is shepherd Gwyn Hughes of Llais Gwynedd, who is the husband of the Llais councillor for the neighbouring Llangelynin ward.  Probably the strongest of the three Independent candidates is Beth Lawton, who is the chair of governors at the local school, Ysgol Bryncrug.  Also standing as Independents are Nancy Clark (a Tywyn town councillor) and John Pughe (who, like Alun Evans, unsuccessfully fought Tywyn ward in May, losing by just one vote).

IVER HEATH, South Bucks district council; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Julian Wilson, for family reasons.  

We move from the land of Ivor the Engine to the ward of Iver Heath, and from the land of Ealing comedy (the Talyllyn Railway inspired the film The Titfield Thunderbolt) to the land of Carry On comedy; Iver Heath is the ward containing Pinewood Studios, one of the biggest centres of the British film industry and home to several famous film franchises, such as Carry On, Superman and most famously James Bond.

The large middle-class village of Iver Heath itself was mostly developed in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries around the Crooked Billet pub, and lies just outside the M25 which runs through the ward from north to south.  It is surprisingly poorly connected to London (and is outside the London Travel to Work Area) but is located just a mile to the west of Uxbridge which is an Underground railhead.

Iver Heath electoral contests are normally straight Conservative/Lib Dem fights.  The two parties were reasonably close in 2003, but the Conservatives have pulled away at every election since and in 2011 polled two-thirds of the vote, the Lib Dems standing just two candidates for the ward's three seats.  In 2007 and 2011 Julian Wilson beat the alphabet to finish top of the poll.

The Conservative nominee for the by-election is Luisa Sullivan; she is opposed by Peter Chapman for the Liberal Democrats, who fought Gerrards Cross North at the last district council election.  This time the duopoly of candidates is broken as Adam Pamment is standing under the UKIP banner.

FRANT/WITHYHAM, Wealden district council, East Sussex; caused by the death of Conservative councillor John Padfield, a farmer, at the age of 73.

Frant/Withyham is another large rural ward, this time covering the affluent Weald countryside between Tunbridge Wells and Crowborough.  It is named after the villages at each end; Frant in the east on the Tunbridge Wells-Mayfield road, and Withyham deep in the countryside at the west end.  In between them is the village of Eridge on the Tunbridge Wells-Crowborough road, which is the ward's best connected village, having a railway station on the Uckfield branch (hourly trains to London Bridge via Oxted) which is also served by the preserved Spa Valley Railway running to Tunbridge Wells West.  Frant also has a railway station on the Hastings Line (hourly trains to Tunbridge Wells and Charing Cross) although this is actually located in a neighbouring hamlet.

Frant has a long history as a centre of the Weald ironworking industry, while Withyham's claim to fame is that it was the setting for a Conan Doyle short story, "The Horror of the Heights".

The electoral heights hold few horrors for the local Conservatives whose vote has gone up by around 300 votes at each of the last two elections, keeping the ward very safe.  In 2007 and 2011 the Green Party ran second (although in 2007 the single Green candidate was the only Conservative opposition).

Slightly disappointingly given that, there is no Green candidate in the by-election which is a fight between the three main parties.  The new Conservative candidate is Frant parish councillor William Rutherford, Tony Rothstein is standing for Labour and Chris Rycroft for the Liberal Democrats.

TUNBRIDGE WELLS EAST, Kent county council; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Kevin Lynes at the age of 53.  He was the county council's cabinet member for regeneration and economic development and was running a task force to support workers following the closure of a steelworks in Sheerness.

The Tunbridge Wells East county division, which has a very short border with Frant/Withyham, consists of three wards of Tunbridge Wells district.  St James' ward covers a mostly residential area in inner Tunbridge Wells; Sherwood ward is north-eastern Tunbridge Wells between the road to Pembury and the railway line to London (High Brooms railway station is within the ward) and as the name suggests includes some woodland.  The county division also extends outside Tunbridge Wells itself to include the large village of Pembury on the old London-Hastings road.

At local level St James' ward is safe for the Liberal Democrats while Pembury and Sherwood normally elect Conservative councillors, although the Lib Dems have won Pembury in a recent by-election and in May there was a double vacancy election there in which an Independent topped the poll.  This adds up to a county division which was reasonably close between Conservative and Lib Dem in 2005 but where the Conservatives pulled away in 2009.

The Conservative candidate in the by-election is James Tansley, who stood in St James' ward in May and had a rather poor result, polling 17% which is some way down on what the Tories used to get there before the formation of the Coalition.  The Liberal Democrats have re-selected St James' district councillor David Neve, who fought the 2009 and 2005 county elections here.  Leaked emails from the Conservative campaign suggest that they are worried about the threat from UKIP, and perhaps they have a point given that UKIP gained a seat on the district council off them last month; the UKIP candidate for the by-election is Christopher Hoare, who polled 30% in Sherwood ward in May.  The ballot paper is completed by Ian Carvell for Labour, who also stood in Sherwood last month, polling 19%; and Tonbridge-based Hazel Dawe, who fought the Tunbridge Wells parliamentary seat in 2010, for the Green Party.

BARNWELL, East Northamptonshire district council; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Philip Hardcastle.  Cllr Hardcastle had served for Barnwell ward since 2007; a former Chair of Rockingham Forest Housing Association, at the time of his death he was Deputy Leader of the Council.

The last of the Conservatives' defences this week is Barnwell ward, which covers a large rural area between Oundle to the north, Thrapston to the south, the River Nene to the west and the Cambridgeshire border to the east.  It was redrawn for the 2007 election, gaining the village of Aldwincle on the other bank of the Nene.

As with this week's Gwynedd by-election there is very little information from previous results, as Hardcastle was unopposed in 2011 and 2007 and his predecessor was unopposed in 2003.  However, there can be little doubt that a Conservative win is the most likely outcome; East Northants is one of the most Tory district councils in England, with the party carrying every single ward in 2003 and winning all but one seat at the 2007 election.  Most of the Barnwell ward is within the very-safe-Conservative Thrapston county division, except for Aldwincle which is part of the equally-safe-Conservative Oundle county division.

I have been able to find out little about the candidates, who are from the three main parties.  The Conservative candidate is Derek Capp, who lives in the ward in Thurning; the Labour candidate Phil Garnham also lives in the ward in Titchmarsh; the Liberal Democrat candidate Karen Draycott is based in Thrapston.

FAILSWORTH EAST, Oldham metropolitan borough council; caused by the death of Labour councillor Barbara Dawson at the age of 67.  A former childminder, she had served for Failsworth East ward from 2004-2008 and again since 2010.

Failsworth is one of those old textile towns which has become completely indistinguishable from its neighbours, another small town in the agglomeration of small towns to the east of Manchester.  It can be found sandwiched between Oldham and Manchester along the main road between them, just inside the M60 orbital motorway.  The Failsworth East ward covers the Hollinwood area in the east of the town, together with the village of Woodhouses (where Mike Atherton learned to play cricket) and the Daisy Nook country park to the south.  Much of the south of the ward is open country around the River Medlock.  At the northern end of the ward the former Hollinwood railway station is scheduled to reopen the day before the poll as part of the Oldham branch of the Manchester Metrolink tram network.

Failsworth East is normally a safe Labour ward but did produce a shock result in 2008 when the Conservatives gained the ward from Barbara Dawson by a majority of just eight votes.  Since then it has all been downhill for the Failsworth branch of the Conservatives who didn't even defend their seat here at the May local elections; the election was a straight fight between Labour and the Lib Dems and resulted in an epic win for Labour with 85.8%.

On that record Labour's candidate Norman Briggs, whose nomination was proposed by the local Labour MP David Heyes (Ashton-under-Lyne) should be pretty certain of winning the by-election.  He is opposed by a new Liberal Democrat candidate, Ron Wise, and by Carrol Ashton of UKIP who are fighting the ward for the first time.
