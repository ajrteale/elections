Five English wards go to the polls on 29th March.  The Conservatives are defending a London seat in their Wandsworth stronghold and a more rural ward in Lincolnshire, while two rural wards on Kent's western border replace long-serving councillors who were unopposed last year.  But we start with a Labour defence of a marginal ward where the losers could find themselves in hot water...

BUXTON CENTRAL, High Peak district council, Derbyshire; caused by the resignation of Labour councilor Philip Ashmore who is now working in Virginia.

At the centre of the Peak District is the town of Buxton, which despite being surrounded by hills on all sides is never lower than 1,000 feet in altitude, making it England's highest market town.  While there was a Roman settlement here, Buxton as we know it today was first developed in Georgian times as a spa town under the influence of the Dukes of Devonshire; they built the town in the style of Bath complete with a Crescent.  

Water is still one of the town's major exports, with the Buxton Mineral Water Company (a Nestlé subsidiary) bottling water from the geothermal spring and selling it all over the world.  The town itself has an interesting economic mix of water, tourism, limestone quarrying from the White Peak and scientific research, with the University of Derby having opened a campus in Buxton in the last few years.

The Buxton Central ward, as the name suggests, covers the central business district, including the Crescent, the spring (St Ann's Well), the town hall and the main shopping centre.  It's a socially mixed area of a very socially mixed town.

Recent election results in Buxton Central have been rather volatile with some support for all the main parties.  (There must be something in that Buxton water.)  Labour won both seats in 2003 in a fairly close three-way split, but fell to third place in 2007 behind the Lib Dems, the Tories taking both seats.  In 2011 Labour regained both seats here but the second seat was won with a majority of just 11 votes over the Conservatives, the Lib Dem vote collapsing.  While the ward is part of a safe Conservative county division (Buxton West) it is very much the Labour end of it.

With that sort of marginality an interesting by-election is in prospect, and with Labour having only minority control of High Peak it's possible (though unlikely) that control of the council could be affected by a Labour loss in the by-election.  Labour have selected Jean Todd, a school governor and former IT worker; Bob Morris of the Conservatives will be the main challenger, having lost his seat here last year.  The Liberal Democrat candidate is electronics engineer David Webb, and the ballot paper is completed by independent candidate Louise Glasscoe.

COWDEN AND HEVER and CROCKENHILL AND WELL HILL, Sevenoaks district council, Kent; caused respectively by the resignation of Conservative councillor Gerry Ryan, for personal reasons, and by the death of Independent councillor Colin Dibsdall at the age of 65.

Cowden and Hever is the most south-westerly ward in Kent, hard up against the Surrey and Sussex borders.  The village of Cowden at the southern end of the ward was ironworking country in the seventeenth century but is now a rural idyll; for London commuters Cowden has a railway station on the Uckfield branch (one train per hour to London Bridge) which was the scene of a fatal head-on collision between two trains in 1994.  Hever parish to the north is named after Hever Castle at its centre, the place where Henry VIII's second wife Anne Boleyn grew up, but most of its population lives in the villages of Markbeech to the south and Four Elms to the north.

Rather different in character is Crockenhill and Well Hill ward, which covers one of the few areas of genuine countryside within the M25 London orbital motorway; in this case, west of junctions 3 and 4.  The ward's largest village, Crockenhill, is a dormitory village located just south of Swanley with some market gardening.  The Irish footballer Tony Cascarino started his career as a boy with Crockenhill football club, who sold him to his first League club Gillingham in 1981, allegedly in exchange for new tracksuits.  

The previous election results for Crockenhill and Well Hill don't give much of a pointer to the by-election; Colin Dibsdall had been the councillor there for many years, and won very large majorities as a Liberal Democrat candidate in 2003 and 2007; in 2011 he sought re-election as an Independent and was unopposed.  For Cowden and Hever there is even less information to go on, as Gerry Ryan had been elected unopposed in each of the previous three elections.  Both wards are part of safe Conservative divisions on Kent county council (Cowden and Hever is part of Sevenoaks South division while Crockenhill and Well Hill is in the Darent Valley division) and safe Conservative parliamentary constituencies (Tonbridge and Malling, and Sevenoaks respectively).

The by-election in Cowden and Hever will be the first contested election in this ward since it was created in 2003.  Defending for the Conservatives is Christopher Neal, who gives an address further up the railway line in Oxted, Surrey; he is opposed by Lorraine Millgate, an office administrator from Cowden, who is standing for UKIP.

In Crockenhill and Well Hill there is still a Dibsdall on the ballot paper, as Colin Dibsdall's widow Jenny has secured the Labour nomination.  Local trainee barrister Adrian Crossley is standing for the Conservatives, and the ballot paper is completed by UKIP candidate Christopher Heath.

HECKINGTON RURAL, North Kesteven district council, Lincolnshire; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Andrew Key due to ill-health.

The large village of Heckington can be found on the Lincolnshire fens, five miles east of Sleaford on the A17 Newark-King's Lynn road.  The village is known for a fine medieval church in the Decorated style and for Britain's only surviving eight-sailed windmill, and has a railway station on the Skegness branch line with roughly hourly trains to Nottingham via Grantham.  

The Heckington Rural ward includes four other parishes to the south of the village (Burton Pedwardine, Great Hale, Little Hale and Helpringham).  The deprivation indices show that Heckington itself is quite well-off, the rest of the ward less so.

The ward has returned a full slate of Tory district councillors since 2003 against varying opposition (in 2007 only UKIP opposed the Conservatives here), with the Conservative majority increasing at every election in this period.  This by-election is a straight fight between Sally Tarry for the Conservatives, who lives in Heckington and is the Great Hale parish council clerk, and Heckington parish councillor Liz Peto, standing for the established county council group Lincolnshire Independents, who fought this ward last year and the local county council division (Sleaford Rural South) in 2009.

SOUTHFIELDS, Wandsworth council, South London; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Lucy Allan, who claims that her group did not support her after recovering from illness.

[My thanks to Adam Gray - @AdamGraySays - for help with this preview.]

The Southfields ward of Wandsworth runs south from Wandsworth High Street along the Merton Road.  Its eastern boundary is the River Wandle and the western boundary is generally the Wimbledon branch of the London Underground District Line, on which is located the Southfields underground station.  

The demographic make-up of the ward is generally white, with the main non-British population group being white South Africans who have emigrated to Britain; just outside the ward boundary is the London Mosque, the oldest mosque in England, and as a result there is a growing Ahmadiyya Muslim community.

The ward is socially mixed but in general becomes more and more middle-class the further south and west you go.  At the north end of the ward is the Arndale estate, a large council estate above the Southside shopping centre which is the core of the Labour vote and scores badly on the deprivation indices.  There is currently some controversy over the council approving major developments (high-rise apartment blocks) in this area.  More upmarket is the Southfields Grid in the south-west of the ward close to the underground station, so-called because of the street pattern - two of the census areas covering the Grid (together with another one to the north around Wimbledon Park Road) are within the 20% least deprived in England.

Politically: this is part of Wandsworth, and within the Putney parliamentary constituency, so it's a safe Conservative ward as is most of the borough regardless of its social/ethnic makeup, thanks to Wandsworth council's aggressively-right-wing low-council-tax policies.  Southfields ward has been Conservative at local level since Labour lost two by-elections in 1978.  At the last local election in 2010 the general election turnout helped Lucy Allan to become one of a select group of councillors who polled over 4,000 votes; Labour took second place from the Lib Dems but it was a very distant second with less than half the Conservative vote.  At the 2008 GLA elections Boris beat Ken here by 45% to 33%, and in the list section of the election the Conservatives topped the poll with 42% to 23% for Labour.

These figures would suggest that the Conservative candidate Kim Caddy, a housewife and former chartered accountant, should have little trouble holding the by-election even allowing for there having been no elections here since the formation of the Coalition.  On the other hand, Labour got a large swing in their favour at a by-election elsewhere in the Putney constituency last year, and their candidate Josh Kaile, a 25-year-old charity worker who claims to be the only local candidate, appears to giving this by-election a good go judging by his leaflets on electionleaflets.org.  

Another local, John Munro, has been selected by the Liberal Democrats; musician Bruce Mackenzie is the Green Party candidate; Strachan McDonald, who fought Tooting at the last general election, is standing for UKIP; and there is an independent candidate from Morden whose name I am having trouble pinning down.  He has put out a leaflet under the name M Akram Choudry and Wandsworth council have put out more than one press release calling him Abid Choudry, but he appears on the Statement of Persons Nominated (and therefore presumably the ballot paper) as Choudry Abid.
