April is normally a lean time for local by-elections; with local elections due in much of the country in May many local parties prefer to postpone by-elections until then, and there is also a presumption against holding by-elections on Maundy Thursday.  There are three by-elections on Thursday 12th April: one in rural Nottinghamshire caused by the death of a councillor, and two in Darlington caused by councillors being disqualified.  But before that, there is a rare Wednesday poll on the 11th:

EAST FINCHLEY, Barnet borough council, North London; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Andrew McNeil who is moving to Northern Ireland for family reasons.

Originally part of the Bishop of London's hunting ground, the London suburb of East Finchley (the N2 postal district) was first seriously developed in the nineteenth century, with the coming of a railway line connecting the area with Kings Cross.  Building was basically complete by 1910 and since then the area has been residential, with a little industry and a large cemetery: the St Pancras and Islington cemetery is described as London's oldest and largest municipal cemetery and is the last resting place of Ford Madox Brown.  The railway line to Kings Cross was replaced in the 1940s by an extension of the Northern Line of the Underground, with East Finchley station at the northern end of a 17-mile tunnel to Morden which was for many years the longest railway tunnel in the world.

The current East Finchley ward runs north and north-west from the underground station along the High Road and the East End Road, as far as the North Circular Road.  Socially it's a rather divided ward, with the area around the East End Road being in the top half of the deprivation indices, the northern end of the High Road being close to the bottom, and the rest of the ward somewhere in between.

Politically, Finchley will always be associated with Margaret Thatcher, having returned her to Parliament from 1959 until 1992.  However, it was never a super-safe seat for her and these days the old Finchley constituency she represented has a majority of Labour councillors (the current Finchley seat includes Golders Green which is a better area for the Tories).  

East Finchley is the core of those Labour wards, having voted for the party at every election since 1982.  The three elections on the current ward boundaries have all produced safe Labour holds, with the Green Party usually finishing third ahead of the Lib Dems (except at the most recent council election in 2010).  In 2008 this was the only ward in the Finchley and Golders Green constituency to vote for Ken Livingstone.

Given the generally middle-class makeup of the area the Labour strength is rather strange; one possible reason is that the ward borders the Hornsey and Wood Green constituency, which similarly leans to the left more than its social makeup might indicate thanks to a large left-liberal population and Guardian readership.  Of course, this may be completely wrong.

The by-election produced no minor party interest and the only candidates are from the three main parties.  Defending for Labour is 25-year-old Arjun Mittra, who is opposed by currency trader Anshul Gupta, standing for the Conservatives, and Jane Gibson for the Liberal Democrats.

Moving on to Thursday's polls, we start with two by-elections in Darlington caused by councillors being disqualified.

HARROWGATE HILL, Darlington council, Co Durham, caused by the disqualification of former Labour councillor Mark Burton; and HURWORTH on the same council, caused by the disqualification of the Liberal Democrat group leader Martin Swainston.  Former councillor Burton is serving a 22-month prison sentence for sexually assaulting a schoolgirl and possession of child pornography, while former councillor Swainston did not attend any council meetings in six months.

240 miles north of East Finchley is another ward on the old Great North Road.  Harrowgate Hill ward is basically the northern end of the market town of Darlington, located on the A167 road towards Durham.  The built-up area merges seamlessly into Harrowgate Village, a relatively new development outside the old borough boundary and still part of Whessoe parish.  Harrowgate Village is a very well-off area but only accounts for about a quarter of the voters; Harrowgate Hill proper is in the middle of the deprivation indices.

While this is certainly one of the nicer areas of Darlington it returned a full slate of Labour councillors in 2003.  In 2007 the Labour vote collapsed and the Conservatives took two of the three seats in an effective photo-finish between the two parties.  Labour regained the Conservative seats last year, but while Mark Burton had a large personal vote at the time the other two seats were won much more narrowly, with majorities of 96 and 47 votes.

Hurworth is a very different ward, covering the rural area immediately to the south of Darlington.  It is based on the village of Hurworth-on-Tees, and also extends to the east to include the smaller villages of Neasham and Sockburn; located in a bend in the river Tees, Sockburn was once the southernmost point of the old county of Durham.  Just outside Hurworth is Rockliffe Hall, built in 1863 by Arthur Backhouse, a member of one of the Quaker families for which Darlington is famous, and now the training complex for Middlesbrough FC.

Hurworth ward was very safe Conservative in 2003 with only Labour opposition.  This changed in September 2005 when Martin Swainston won a by-election here for the Lib Dems, the Conservative vote collapsing.  The Liberal Democrats followed up in 2007 by gaining the second seat and making the ward safe for them; Labour polled just 2.4% that year, which must be some sort of record for a ward in County Durham.  In 2011 Swainston had a large personal vote but his running-mate fell to only 63 votes ahead of the Conservatives.

Both by-elections are being contested by the three main parties and UKIP.  In Harrowgate Hill, where Labour could be in some trouble given the circumstances of the by-election and the loss of Burton's personal vote, they have selected Helen Crumbie.  The Tories have gone for Gill Cartwright, who was top of the poll here in 2007 and lost her seat last year.  The Lib Dems, who didn't stand here in 2011, have selected Hilary Allen, Daniel Fairclough is standing for UKIP and Paul Thompson is standing for the far-right England First party.

In Hurworth the disqualified Lib Dem councillor Martin Swainston is standing for re-election.  There is a precedent for this in County Durham (an Independent councillor won a by-election in South Tyneside in 2009 caused by his being kicked off the council for non-attendance) but it's still an interesting redefinition of chutzpah.  Swainston is opposed by Christopher Brownbridge for the Conservatives, Steve Rose for Labour and David Davies for UKIP.

LOWDHAM, Newark and Sherwood district council, Nottinghamshire; caused by the death of the Chairman of the Council, Conservative councillor Keith Sheppard.

Seven miles north-east of Nottingham is the large village of Lowdham, located at the junction of the A612 Nottingham-Southwell and A6097 Bingham-Farnsfield roads.  It is served by a railway station on the Nottingham-Lincoln line, with roughly hourly trains to Nottingham.  This may not seem much to say about the place, but it's all I could get out of Wikipedia.  The Lowdham ward includes the nearby villages of Bulcote, Gunthorpe, Caythorpe, Hoveringham, Gonalston and Epperstone.

The politics of the ward are even less interesting than its Wikipedia entry: in 2003, 2007 and 2011 it elected two Conservative councillors unopposed.  The most recent contested local election in the area was the 2009 Nottinghamshire county council election, with the Conservatives winning the local county division (Farnsfield and Lowdham) by almost five to one against only Labour opposition.

Thursday's by-election will be the first contested election in Lowdham ward since it took on its current boundaries in 2003 (Newark and Sherwood was re-warded in 2007 but this ward wasn't changed).  Four candidates have been nominated: Tim Wendels for the Conservatives, Daniel Hibberd for Labour, Liberal Democrat William Davison and independent Tim Cutler.
