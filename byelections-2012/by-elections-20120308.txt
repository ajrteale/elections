For the three by-elections on 8th March we travel to three of England's towns that begin with S.  There are polls in a safe Labour ward in Slough, a safe Conservative ward in Sittingbourne, and a Conservative/Labour marginal in Stafford.

BAYLIS AND STOKE, Slough Council; caused by the disqualification of Labour councillor Azhar Qureshi, who did not attend any meetings of the council in six months.  He had been taken ill while on holiday in Pakistan and was unable to return to the UK on doctors' advice.

Travel west out of London on the M4 motorway or the Great Western main line, and Slough is the first town you reach.  It's a very atypical town for the south of England, as its economy for many years was based on manufacturing; this really took off in the 1920s with the development of the Slough Trading Estate, which insulated the town from the Great Depression and attracted an enormous number of immigrants from all over the world.  Today the factories are dying off and being replaced by office buildings for multinational companies, attracted by the town's good transport links and closeness to Heathrow Airport.

Perhaps because of this and Slough's working-class nature, the town gets a bad press.  The neighbouring town of Windsor, on the other side of the River Thames, has for years been lobbying Royal Mail to take it out of the Slough postcode area, with a complete lack of success.  Most outsiders know Slough for two things: the Ricky Gervais 'comedy' The Office, which was set in the town, and John Betjeman's 1937 poem ("Come friendly bombs and fall on Slough! It isn't fit for humans now").

Baylis and Stoke ward is a residential area north-west of the town centre and west of Stoke Poges Lane, running from the railway line in the south to the borough boundary (which is closely drawn around the built-up area) to the north.  The 2001 census found that the ward was majority Asian (Pakistani 31.5% and Indian 18.8% to White British 34.9%); 32.7% gave their religion as Christian compared to 31.6% Muslim and 12.7% Sikh.

Slough council politics became a bit fractured in the Noughties with a galaxy of different Independent groups, but this now appears to be settling down and Labour have a large majority on the council.  Baylis and Stoke ward was created in 2004 out of two previous safe Labour wards, Baylis and Stoke, but was won at its first contest by the Liberal Democrats.  Labour took the three Lib Dem seats back between 2006 and 2008, but it took until 2011 for the Lib Dem vote to collapse, almost entirely in Labour's favour with Labour polling over 80% last year.

The list of candidates is a strange one.  Labour have nominated local bank manager Mohammed Nazir, Ivan Dukes is the representative of the council's bickering independents and UKIP are standing here for the first time in the form of Allan Deverill.   Interestingly there are no Conservative or Lib Dem candidates; even more interestingly at the top of the ballot paper appears the current Central ward councillor Pervez Choudhry.  Choudhry gained Central ward for Labour from the Conservatives in 2008, then defected to the Conservatives and became group leader, then had the Conservative whip suspended after being charged with bigamy.  Not that this should stop Nazir easily holding the ward for Labour.

KEMSLEY, Swale District Council, Kent; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Brenda Simpson.

The UK has quite a few planned villages which were built by indstrialists to serve workers at their mills.  New Lanark in Scotland, Saltaire in Shipley, Bourneville in Birmingham and Port Sunlight on the Wirral are the most famous; close to me is the lesser-known planned village of Barrow Bridge, now on the edge of Bolton.  But until writing this preview I hadn't been aware of Kemsley as a place that falls into this category.

In 1924 Frank Lloyd, a paper magnate who already owned a successful mill in Sittingbourne, developed a new paper mill on the Kentish marshes at Kemsley, and in order to house its workers he developed a garden village.  Sittingbourne Paper Mill closed a few years ago, but the Kemsley Mill is still going strong; it the UK's largest recycler of waste paper and one of Europe's largest paper mills.  

There was once a narrow-gauge railway connecting the two mills to docks at Ridham on the Swale, part of which is now preserved as the Sittingbourne and Kemsley Light Railway; at the other end of the village Kemsley has a main-line railway station on the Sheerness branch (two trains per hour to Sheerness and Sittingbourne, change at Sittingbourne for London).

Today Kemsley is a suburb of Sittingbourne, the gap between them having been filled in recent years with the construction of the private Church Milton estate, which also transformed the ward from traditional Labour (thanks to the paper mill workers) to safe Conservative.  Brenda Simpson was first elected for the ward in 1988 and had represented it ever since.

The three main parties plus UKIP are on the ballot paper.  The Conservative candidate is Mike Whiting, who is a county councillor for the local division of Swale Central.  Labour have selected Richard Raycraft; the Lib Dem candidate is former district councillor Berick Tomes, while former Tory campaigner Derek Carnell is standing for UKIP.

ROWLEY, Stafford District Council; caused by the death of Conservative councillor David Allan at the age of 65.  Before becoming a councillor he had served in the Royal Air Force for 31 years and rose to the rank of Squadron Leader.

Rowley ward covers western parts of the town of Stafford.  Running south-west from the Brutalist railway station along the Newport Road, it includes the gentrifying former railway workers' estate of Castletown and runs across open country to the ruined Stafford Castle, a landmark next to the M6 motorway.  However, the ward is named after Rowley Park, a middle-class residential area located around the eponymous park and the private Rowley Hall Hospital.

With the ward mostly having prosperous demographics, you might assume that this would be a safe Conservative ward.  Indeed the ward has returned two Conservative councillors at every election since 2003, but only in 2007 could it be described as safe: the 2003 election had Conservative majorities of 23 and 9 votes, and the majorities at the 2011 election were 109 and 24 votes.  This will gave Labour hope that they can gain a seat here in the by-election.

Both main parties have selected candidates with experience in healthcare: Vi Allen for the Conservatives is a former nurse who now works as a chiropodist, while Labour's Anne Hobbs is described as a nurse health visitor.  The Lib Dems are sitting out the by-election after polling dismally last year.  The Greens have selected their regular candidate here Kate Harding, while UKIP have gone for Malcolm Hurst.
