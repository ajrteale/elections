After the frantic recent pace of local by-elections, much of the backlog of vacancies has been cleared in time for the summer holidays.  Thursday 19th July sees just three local by-elections, all following resignations of councillors from the Coalition parties.  There is a Conservative defence on the south coast and a difficult seat for the Lib Dems to hold in Halifax.  However, we start in Norfolk with the first of a hat-trick of July by-elections in Breckland district.


QUEEN'S, Breckland district council, Norfolk; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Simon Rogers who has moved to Cornwall.

One of those generic, uninformative ward names here.  Queen's ward in Breckland is one of two wards covering the town of Attleborough, a market town on the A11 London-Norwich road which was once the home of Gaymer's cider.  The Queen's ward covers the northern half of the town together with the village of Besthorpe (now a suburb of the town) to the north-east and a rural hinterland.

The ward is safe Conservative, with the main challenge in recent years coming from Independent candidate Bob Smith who polled 41% in a straight Conservative/Independent fight in 2007 and lost 49-38 in a by-election on European election day in 2009, Labour polling the other 13%.  After that Smith gave up and the Conservatives were unopposed in 2011.

Unlike 2011, this by-election is contested, with the Conservative candidate Karen Pettitt, a town councillor and former mayor of Attleborough, facing off against Labour candidate John Williams, a sports journalist.

MILFORD, New Forest district council, Hampshire; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Michael Pemberton.

Milford ward includes Hampshire's southernmost point at Hurst Castle, on a spit of land marking the western end of the Solent.  For those who don't fancy the walk along the spit a ferry service to the castle is available in season from the touristy fishing hamlet of Keyhaven.  Keyhaven and Hurst Castle are within the New Forest National Park, but the village of Milford on Sea, a seaside retirement village which is the largest settlement within Milford ward, is not.  The ward includes the whole of Milford-on-Sea parish together with a small part of the neighbouring village of Everton, including the former Efford Horticultural Research Station, now a nursery.

This ward is even safer for the Conservatives than Queen's ward above, the most recent result being a 79-21 win in a straight fight with a single Labour candidate in 2011.  The Tories defeated a single Liberal Democrat candidate by the same score in 2007.

The Conservatives have selected Milton-on-Sea parish councillor Sophie Beeton as their candidate in the by-election; she is opposed by Labour candidate Caroline Hexter, a nursery school teacher from New Milton.

WARLEY, Calderdale metropolitan borough council, West Yorkshire; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Keith Hutson for health reasons.

This ward covers the western end of the town of Halifax, named after the suburb of Warley Town and also including the Mount Tabor, Moor End Road and Spring Hall Lane areas.

On previous form, this is definitely the most interesting ward in this week's selection, having elected councillors from all three parties in the last six years.  When the ward was first drawn up in 2004 it elected two Independent councillors and a Liberal Democrat with the Conservatives very close behind.  The Conservatives came from third place to win in 2006, gaining a seat from one of the Independents; the Liberal Democrats held their seat in the 2007 election (which was postponed to June after one of the candidates died) and gained the other Independent seat in 2008.  

Before 2008 Labour had normally run fourth in this ward behind the BNP (fifth if there was an independent standing) but they put a lot of effort into the 2010 election here, the ward being part of the Halifax constituency which was a Conservative target.  They were rewarded with a thousand extra votes and second place, although still nearly 500 votes behind the Lib Dems who gained the Conservative seat.  The Lib Dem majority was cut to 153 in 2011 and this May Labour won the ward for the first time with a majority of 113.

The result from 2012 suggests that the Lib Dems can't be entirely written off here yet; their candidate is James Baker, from Mytholmroyd, who was runner-up in the May election and runs a printing business.  Labour's challenge will come from former Hebden Royd town councillor Jonathan Timbers.  Last May's Conservative candidate Christopher Pearson tries again, and the ballot paper is completed by Charles Gate of the Green Party, who are standing here for the first time.
