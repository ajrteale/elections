SUTTON ON SEA NORTH, East Lindsey district council, Lincolnshire; caused by the resignation of Andrew Ferrryman, the leader of the Sutton on Sea First party, due to ill-health.

The village of Sutton on Sea can be found on the Lincolnshire coast, about two miles south of Mablethorpe and fourteen miles north of Skegness.  Although there was a nineteenth-century proposal to develop a railway port here this came to nothing and the village is now generally a retirement area.

The geographically large East Lindsey council, which covers the area, is one of the last refuges in England of rural Independents, and this ward has elected Independent councillors in various guises since 2003; Robert 'Bud' Shields as an independent in 2003, Shields again in 2007 as part of the East Lindsey Independent Group, and Ferryman (emphatically) in 2011 under the banner of Sutton on Sea First.

To replace Ferryman, Sutton on Sea First have nominated Steve Palmer, a member of Mablethorpe and Sutton town council who is described as an ex-RAF freelance journalist.  The Conservative candidate is David Andrews, who fought Sutton on Sea South ward at the district council elections last year; interestingly, he is fighting a simultaneous town council by-election for the same ward as an Independent against an official Conservative candidate.  Labour's candidate, retired local government health and safety officer Joyce Taylor, is trying again and should improve on her rather dismal result from 2011; she has a much higher profile within the ward now as the current Mayor of Mablethorpe and Sutton.  The ballot paper is completed by independent candidate Ian Wild, a town councillor.

WHITEFOOT, Lewisham council, South London; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Pete Pattisson to take up a teaching job in India.

Another tract of the endless London suburbia, the long and thin Whitefoot ward is named after the dual-carriageway Whitefoot Lane, which runs the length of the ward from east to west.  The ward includes Hither Green Cemetery and Forster Memorial Park.  It's on the edge of the London postal area, with the area north of Whitefoot Lane being in the SE6 (Catford) postal district and the area to the south having Bromley (BR1) postcodes.

The ward is closely fought at local level between Labour and the Liberal Democrats.  The three seats split 2LD/1Lab at the first election to the current ward in 2002; the Lib Dems gained the Labour seat in 2006 and held it at a September 2007 by-election, but Labour got it back in 2010, their councillor topping the poll and a long way ahead of the other two Labour candidates.

The only electoral contest in this ward since the formation of the Coalition is the GLA election last May, in which Ken beat Boris 54-32 and Labour beat the Conservatives 54-19 on the list vote.  The Lib Dems did at least salvage third place in both contests, which was more than they managed in most of London.  A by-election in the neighbouring Bellingham ward last year will give Labour further cause for optimism, as they held the seat with a large swing from the Lib Dems.

The Liberal Democrats will hope that local resident Janet Hurst can defend the seat in a race which will feature six candidates (seven were nominated but the National Front candidate has withdrawn).  Hurst's main opposition will come from the other candidate with an address in the ward, Labour's Mark Ingleby who fought the Tory ward of Grove Park in 2010.  The Conservatives and Lewisham People Before Profit have selected their 2010 Lewisham mayoral candidates, Simon Nundy (from Blackheath) and John Hamilton (from Brockley) respectively.  The Green Party have gone for Ute Michel, who lost his seat in Ladywell ward in 2010, and UKIP have recruited a former Tory council candidate, Paul Oakley who fought Lewisham Central two years ago.
