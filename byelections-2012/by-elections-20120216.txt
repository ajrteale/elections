This week sees four by-elections all caused by resignations.  There is a safe Conservative ward in West Sussex, a fascinating C/Lab ward on the Leicestershire coalfield, and two LD/C contests in councils with long-standing Lib Dem control.

IBSTOCK AND HEATHER, North West Leicestershire DC; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Stacey Harris, a second-year Loughborough University student who had apparently fallen out with her council group.

The large village of Ibstock can be found about 13 miles west-north-west of Leicester, on the A447 Coalville-Hinckley road.  It is on the Leicestershire coalfield and, with a coal seam about 200 feet below the surface, a colliery was established here in the 1820s.  Coal is no longer mined here, but the colliery had a sideline in brick-making which has thrived and developed over the years into Ibstock plc, which is now the UK's largest brick manufacturer and is still based in the village.  The ward of Ibstock and Heather also includes the smaller village of Heather to the west.  Socially the ward is rather mixed but not too badly off overall.

North West Leicestershire council itself is a rather mixed area, including almost the whole of the coalfield (whose major town is unsurprisingly named Coalville) but also some Tory rural areas around Castle Donington and the socially mixed town of Ashby-de-la-Zouch.  This added up to a district that up until 2007 was Labour-controlled more often than not, but in 2007 the Labour vote collapsed here and Labour went from control of the council to holding just five seats.  One of those five seats was held in the formerly-safe-Labour Ibstock and Heather ward, the Tories gaining the other two seats.  A large part of the Labour vote ebbed away to minor parties; two seats were won by the BNP, who topped the poll in neighbouring Hugglescote ward, and in Ibstock in 2007 UKIP polled almost 20%.

There then followed a series of two fascinating by-elections in this ward.  The remaining Labour councillor died in 2007 and a by-election was held in January 2008 which Labour held by 62 votes over the BNP, who finished second with the Conservatives third.  One of the Conservative councillors then died and a second by-election was held in December 2008 which was even closer; this time the Conservatives held by 15 votes over the BNP with Labour in third just 28 votes further behind.  The BNP followed up in 2009 by taking a clear second place in the local county division of Ibstock and Appleby, which includes more favourable Conservative territory and was an easy Conservative gain from Labour, and easily saved their deposit in the 2010 general election for the North West Leicestershire constituency, which has the same boundaries as the district council and was a Conservative gain from Labour, the previous Labour MP having died a few months before the election.

Then at the last district council election in 2011 the local BNP basically threw in the towel, standing just one candidate in what had been one of their best districts.  Ivan Hammonds, the previous BNP standard-bearer in Ibstock, stood as an independent.  The Conservatives held overall control of the district with a reduced majority, while Labour gained one seat off the Conservatives in Ibstock and Heather to leave the ward split 1C/2Lab.

With such close results in the last few years this by-election - the third in this ward in just over four years - looks very unpredictable.  I haven't been able to find much biographical information on the candidates, but all of them did stand last year for wards in the coalfield.  The defending Labour candidate is Dave de Lacy, who narrowly lost year in Greenhill ward (east of Coalville), while the Tory candidate is Russell Boam, who narrowly lost last year in the Coalville suburb of Whitwick.  Ivan Hammonds is standing again as an Independent.  The Lib Dems have re-selected Kim Wyatt, who had by far the best performance of the three Lib Dem candidates in this ward last year; Sue Morrell (who fought Barden, south-east of Coalville, last year) is the Green Party candidate, and UKIP's candidate is Ashby-de-la-Zouch based Jakob Whiten, who last year fought the safe-Labour Coalville suburb of Thringstone for the Conservatives.

ITCHINGFIELD, SLINFOLD AND WARNHAM, Horsham DC, West Sussex; caused by the resignation of the Leader of the Council, Conservative councillor Robert Nye, due to financial difficulties with his business.

This is one of those long wards made up of lots of little villages.  It is named after its three constituent parishes, Itchingfield (south-west of Horsham), Slinfold (west of Horsham) and Warnham (north-west of Horsham).  On the boundary of Itchingfield parish is Christ's Hospital station on the Arun Valley railway line, whose hourly service to Victoria station attracts London commuters; the other two parishes have worse transport links and are further down the social scale (although not deprived by any stretch of the imagination).

The ward is part of the safe Conservative Horsham parliamentary constituency, which returns Francis Maude to Parliament, and this is now a safe Conservative ward.  The two seats split C/LD in 2003 with the Tories topping the poll by just 6 votes, but the Lib Dems lost their seat here in 2007 and fell further behind last May.

The three losing candidates from last May, Ian Shepherd (LD, from Warnham), Justin Pickard (Grn, from Barns Green, a village in Itchingfield parish) and George Tribe (UKIP, from Itchingfield) have all been re-selected to fight the by-election.  The Conservatives have selected Stuart Ritchie, a chartered accountant from Warnham, while Labour are fighting the ward for the first time; Horsham-based nursery manager (in the sense of growing plants) David Hide is hoping to sow the seeds for a good Labour performance.

OADBY WOODLANDS, Oadby and Wigston BC, Leicestershire; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Malcolm Brown.

One of England's smallest district councils with a population of less than 60,000, Oadby and Wigston borough covers two middle-class suburbs of Leicester which for some reason have never become part of the city proper.  

Oadby Woodlands ward, one of five wards covering Oadby, is the south-eastern end of the Leicester built-up area, located on the northern side of the A6 London Road.  It is one of the most well-off areas of a well-off town (the ward's three census areas are all within the 20% least deprived in England, and two of them are within the 4% least deprived) but hasn't escaped the demographic change which Leicester has seen: at the 2001 census nearly 26% of the population were ethnically Indian, mostly Hindu.

Rather like Sutton below, Oadby and Wigston combines prosperity with many years of Liberal Democrat control, in this case going back to 1991 with often huge majorities (in 1995 the Lib Dems almost had a clean sweep with 25 seats out of 26).  The district is the most Lib Dem part of the Conservative parliamentary seat of Harborough, which the Lib Dems have been targeting unsuccessfully for years.  The three elections in this ward since 2003 have all seen very similar results, the Lib Dems winning a straight fight with the Conservatives with between 55% and 59% of the vote.

The Lib Dems have selected Naveed Alam, who fought Oadby Grange ward last year and was one of only three Lib Dem candidates in the district not to be elected.  The Conservatives have re-selected Bhupendra Dave [note to editor: not Dave Bhupendra] who fought the ward last year, and this time the LD/C duopoly of candidates is broken as UKIP have nominated Dan Price, who fought Oadby St Peter's ward for the Conservatives last year.

WORCESTER PARK, Sutton, South London; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Jennifer Campbell-Klomps, who is moving abroad.

Worcester Park was originally a deer park adjacent to Henry VIII's Nonsuch Palace, and is named after the 4th Earl of Worcester who became Keeper of the park in 1606.  Today it's another tract of the seemingly endless middle-class inter-war suburbia in outer London, located west of the A24 London Road, north of the A2043 Malden Road and east of the Waterloo-Epsom railway line.  That line includes Worcester Park station from where trains reach Waterloo in around 25 minutes.

The area is the north-western corner of the London Borough of Sutton, which has been Liberal Democrat-controlled since 1990.  When this ward was created in 2002 it was one of the Lib Dem wards with a safe majority.  The Lib Dems performed relatively poorly in 2006 and Worcester Park was gained by the Conservatives, but the Lib Dems bounced back at the last council elections to split the ward's representation, gaining two of the three seats.

The Lib Dems have a large majority in Sutton, but this by-election is in a split ward and the Tories will fancy their chances of victory.  They have selected Simon Densley, a local school governor and IT worker, while the Lib Dem candidate is Roger Roberts, a veteran councillor who lost his seat in the neighbouring Nonsuch ward two years ago.  Labour's perennial Worcester Park candidate Hilary Hosking, who works in the rail industory, is standing again; she is the only candidate who lives in the ward.  Also on the ballot paper are George Dow of the Green Party, who is based at the other end of the borough in Wallington and fought Carshalton and Wallington at the last general election, and UKIP's David Pickles who was their parliamentary candidate for the local seat of Sutton and Cheam two years ago.

The campaign has seen an interesting own goal by the Lib Dem side: the area has recently lost a police sergeant, so to highlight this Lib Dems put out a leaflet promoting the website saveoursergeants.org.uk but failed to buy the domain name first, allowing the Tories to snap it up and use it to say nasty things about the Lib Dem candidate.
