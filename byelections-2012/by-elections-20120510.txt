By-elections in the week after the main local elections always tend to have an "after the Lord Mayor's Show" feel about them.  Nevertheless there are two by-elections this week together with a poll in Scotland which was postponed from the May elections.

CHINNOR, South Oxfordshire council; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Geoff Andrews, who has moved away from the village.

A rather isolated large village in the Oxfordshire countryside, Chinnor lies on the ancient Icknield Way underneath the escarpment of the Chiltern Hills.  It once had industry in the form of a cement works, but now the main reason to visit the village is a preserved steam railway linking Chinnor with the Buckinghamshire town of Princes Risborough, which has a rail link to London.

The Conservative vote in Chinnor has grown over the years and rather left behind the main challenge, which has traditionally come from Independents associated with the parish council.  The ward's two seats split C/Ind in 2003 but the Conservatives gained the Independent seat in 2007 and increased their majority last year.

The by-election is again a three-way fight between the Conservatives' Lynn Lloyd, independent candidate Martin Wright who with Lloyd sits on the parish council, and Labour candidate Simon Stone.

DUNOON, Argyll and Bute council; a postponed poll from last week caused by the death of SNP councillor Alister MacAlister at the age of 81, a day after he was nominated for re-election.

The resort town of Dunoon can be found on the western side of the Firth of Clyde, in the deeply-inlet west coast of Scotland.  Despite being just thirty miles west of Glasgow as the crow flies, the roads are such that driving to Glasgow around the head of Loch Long is a 75-mile journey; a better option is to use the frequent ferry service to Gourock on the Renfrewshire side of the firth, which cuts the distance travelled in half.  The town's economy has never really recovered from the closure of the US submarine base at Holy Loch following the end of the Cold War; possibly the biggest earner for the town these days is the Cowal Highland Gathering, held here every August.

The three-seat Dunoon ward takes in the town together with the sparsely-populated peninsula to its south between the Firth of Clyde and Loch Striven; however, it does not include the Dunoon suburbs of Kirn and Hunter's Quay to the north.

The first elections under STV in 2007 elected independent candidates Dick Walsh and Jimmy McQueen with MacAlister the final candidate to make quota, well ahead of the Labour and Lib Dem candidates.  Both independents had previously sat on Argyll and Bute council, McQueen for the former Ardenslate ward which covered the Dunoon waterfront (defeating MacAlister in the 2003 election), Walsh for the Auchamore and Inellan ward which covered the peninsula.

Both McQueen and Walsh are standing for re-election.  The SNP had originally gone for two seats here this time round but have decided not to nominate anyone else after MacAlister's death; their remaining candidate is Michael Breslin.  Mick Rice is the Labour candidate this time, Tony Miles is standing for the Lib Dems again despite giving an address in Lenzie on the other side of Glasgow (a road distance of 87 miles from the ward you are standing in must be some sort of record for a UK local election) and William Green is the Conservative candidate.

With this ward's three seats outstanding Argyll and Bute council's composition is currently Ind 13 SNP 12 C 4 LD 4.  With no group having a majority the result of this election is being waited for before coalition negotiations begin.

KIDSGROVE, Newcastle-under-Lyme council, Staffordshire; caused by the disqualification of 20-year-old former Labour councillor Kyle-Noel Taylor who is serving a six-month prison sentence for assaulting his ex-girlfiend.  Taylor had appealed against the sentence; the rejection of his appeal came too late for the by-election to be combined with the normal May elections so the voters of Kidsgrove are going to the polls twice in as many weeks.

The town of Kidsgrove marks the northern end of the Potteries.  Once a coal-mining town, it is now a commuter town for Stoke-on-Trent, with its railway station having three trains to Stoke every hour (one of which continues to London Euston), two trains per hour to Crewe and one to Manchester.  The town is located at the junction of several transport arteries, presently the Stoke-Manchester and Crewe-Derby railway lines, previously the Trent and Mersey, and Macclesfield canals.  The Kidsgrove ward only covers the north-eastern part of the town it is named after, the Whitehill area.

These days the town votes like a coalfield town (Labour polled 66% here last week) but it was not always so; the ward's three seats split 1LD/2Lab at the first election on the current boundaries in 2002, the Lib Dem councillor was re-elected in 2006 and the Lib Dems gained the other two seats in 2007 and 2008.  Kyle-Noel Taylor narrowly defeated the Lib Dems in 2010 despite Labour disowning him after his arrest for assault shortly before the election; it was too late for Taylor to be replaced as the Labour candidate.  Labour took the other two Lib Dem seats at a double-vacancy election in 2011, UKIP finishing as runners-up that year.  There was no UKIP candidate last week and the Conservatives were runners-up, seven votes ahead of the Lib Dems.

Last week's election gave Labour an overall majority on Newcastle-under-Lyme council and with those sort of figures a second Labour victory in Kidsgrove looks certain.  Their candidate this week is Terry Turner; his opposition comes from Linda Harold for the Conservatives, Phil Crank for the Lib Dems and Claire Vodrey, who also stood in last week's election for the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition.
