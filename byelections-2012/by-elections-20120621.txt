This is a busy week with seven by-elections plus the final piece of unfinished business from the May elections, and the contests this week will have something for everyone with a good geographical and demographic spread.  There is a distinct New Town flavour this week, with the Conservatives defending county and district council seats in Hemel Hempstead and a difficult Lib Dem defence in Peterlee.  The Tories also defend the only rural ward in this selection, in Huntingdonshire, a London suburban seat in Esher and a West Midlands suburban seat in Stourbridge.  Labour have one defence in urban Carlisle.  But first we make a return visit to a ward in Devon which has featured in this column very recently indeed.


TAVISTOCK NORTH, West Devon district council; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Mike Harper for personal reasons.

[Tom, can you put this in a 'quote' box or similar?]
"Tavistock, located twenty-five miles north of Plymouth, is the largest town in the sparsely-populated West Devon local government district.  Although known to the wider world almost solely as the birthplace of the Elizabethan admiral Sir Francis Drake, the town was already rich by Drake's time through a combination of religion (Tavistock Abbey), the cloth trade and tin-mining.  After the dissolution of the Abbey the dominant force in the town became the Dukes of Bedford who took over the abbey's land.  

Copper-mining became the major local industry by about 1800, earning the Dukes of Bedford so much money that they were able to comprehensively rebuild the town centre.  With such wealth eventually comes a major liability for death duties, and in 1911 the Bedford family had to sell most of their holdings in the town in order to meet them; the town council ended up with much of the property and as a result of these holdings is one of the richest parish councils in England.

Today Tavistock is a typical country market town with some Plymouth commuting and a significant tourist trade, drawn by its scenery, rural tranquility and the town's many independent shops.

The Tavistock North ward covers the part of the town north of the River Tavy, including much of the town centre, together with some rural scenery to the north, south and east (including a small part of the Dartmoor National Park).  Its past election results suggest that this is the sort of the area where the person matters almost as much as the party; the ward's three seats split 2C/1LD in both 2003 and 2007; the Lib Dems then gained a seat in a February 2008 by-election following the resignation (or possibly death; sources conflict) of one of the Conservative councillors.  The Conservatives did bounce back in 2011 to win all three seats, but the third Tory seat was gained with a majority of just one vote over a slate of independent candidates."

You may recognise these words from my preview for the by-elections held on 22nd March this year, which also included a Tavistock North by-election following the resignation of a Conservative councillor.  I wrote at the time that 'the poor Tory performance in the 2008 by-election, also held after a seat became vacant within a few months of election, does not give them much grounds for optimism this time round with the resigning councillor under somewhat of a cloud', and so it came to pass as they lost that by-election to Independent candidate Jeff Moody, who had been just 8 votes short in the May 2011 election.  

Having to defend a second by-election, also due to resignation, just twelve weeks later is probably the last thing the local Tory association needs.  After failing in March with a TV star candidate, this time they are trying a different strategy by persuading independent town councillor John Sheldon to stand under their banner.   Confusingly, while a former-Independent town councillor is standing for the Conservatives, a former Conservative district councillor is standing as an Independent: she is Caroline Keane, who was elected as a Conservative councillor for the predecessor ward in 1999 and came within 21 votes of being re-elected as an Independent in 2003.  Joyce Hillson is standing for the Liberal Democrats and the ballot paper is completed by Labour candidate Moira Brown, who also stood here in 2011 and in the March by-election.

HEMEL HEMPSTEAD TOWN, Hertfordshire county council; and WOODHALL FARM, Dacorum district council, Hertfordshire; both caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Steve Holmes, who was a member of the Dacorum cabinet, after he was arrested on suspicion of possessing child pornography.

A small agricultural market town throughout the 19th century, Hemel Hempstead boomed after the Second World War as in 1946 it was designated as one of the first New Towns, to house people displaced by the Blitz and slum clearance in London.  The town has been a success and the 2001 census found that it had overtaken Watford to become the largest urban area in Hertfordshire.

The county and district wards cover separate areas.  I'll start with Hemel Hempstead Town county division which contains relatively little of the New Town developments.  It essentially has three parts: Aspley at the south end, originally a nineteenth century mill town based on the paper industry; Boxmoor at the west end, a Victorian-era development around Hemel Hempstead railway station; and the town centre at the north end of the division along the Gade Valley.  Hemel's railway station, in Boxmoor, has four trains per hour to Watford and Euston, two of which also call at Aspley railway station, plus an hourly train to East Croydon via Watford and the West London Line.  Labour came within 500 votes of winning in 2005 but fell back to third place in 2009 as the division became safe Conservative.  In 2011 the four district wards wholly or partially covered by the division returned a full slate of Conservative district councillors.

Woodhall Farm, on the other hand, was one of the last developments to be completed, with the housing dating from the mid to late-1970s; before then the site was a fireworks factory.  The ward is at the north-eastern end of town on the road to Redbourn.  Much of the housing here was privately developed, and this is reflected in the ward being a safe Conservative area, although there are some areas here which rank worse on the deprivation indices than anything in the Hemel Town county division.  The Conservative majority here in 2011 was virtually identical to 2007.

Both by-elections have a field of six candidates.  For Hemel Town county division the new Conservative standard-bearer is William Wyatt-Lowe, a district councillor for Adeyfield East ward (and husband of the remaining Woodhall Farm district councillor) who is described as a successful local businessman.  Chris Angell, a pension fund chairman and local church treasurer, is standing for the Liberal Democrats, while Labour have selected Berkhamsted-based university lecturer Mike Bromberg.  Paul Harris, who is retired after 20 years' work in adult education, is the Green Party candidate; Howard Koch, a dentist from Stanmore in Middlesex, is the UKIP nominee; and retired enviromentalist Rodney Tucker is standing as an Independent.

In Woodhall Farm, the Tories have nominated Rosie Sutton.  Labour's candidate here is former district councillor (for Bennetts End ward) Paul Eastwood who used to manage the Woodhall Farm council estates.  The Liberal Democrat candidate Nitesh Dave teaches science at Astley Cooper School.  Paul de Hoest from Berkhamsted, a Navy officer turned senior director in the City, is standing for the Green Party; Simon Deacon, a parish councillor for the nearby village of Markyate, is the English Democrats candidate; and Howard Koch is again the UKIP nominee.

PETERLEE WEST, Durham county council; caused by the death of Liberal Democrat councillor Barbara Sloan, a former Easington district councillor, at the age of 75.

We move north to the final New Town contest this week, although this New Town is not on the same scale as Hemel Hempstead.  Roughly halfway between Sunderland and Hartlepool, Peterlee was originally built to house coal miners and their families, and is named after an early-20th-century Durham miners' leader.  Despite the high hopes of the New Town pioneers, Peterlee is a rather deprived town with few transport links other than the A19 road to Sunderland and Hartlepool.

The Peterlee West ward is almost entirely built up, hard up against the eastern end of the A19.  It is based on two wards of the now-abolished Easington district council, Acre Rigg to the north and Howletch to the south.  Easington was notorious for the number of Labour councillors elected unopposed (28 out of 44 in 2003, 25 out of 47 in 2007) and Howletch ward was uncontested in the 2003 and 2007 election.  Acre Rigg, on the other hand, was an anomaly in that it was Easington's only Liberal Democrat ward, apparently based on a personal vote for Sloan.  While at the 2005 county elections Labour won Peterlee West with 85.8% of the vote against only Conservative opposition, the 2008 elections to the new Durham unitary council saw the two Lib Dem councillors for Acre Rigg face off against the two Labour councillors for Howletch, the Lib Dems winning by 56% to 44%.

There have been no local elections in Durham since 2008 (Durham county council is next up for election in 2013), so it's difficult to tell how the very different political climate four years will play out in the by-election.  However, if we look at demographically and culturally similar wards in places like Sunderland, it would appear that the local Lib Dems, particularly without Sloan, are staring defeat in the face.  Their new candidate is Wendy Bentley, while Labour have gone for a strong candidate in Jimmy Alvey who is deputy leader of Peterlee town council.  The Tories have found a candidate, NHS nurse Harvey Morgan from Crossgate Moor near Durham, and Karen Hawley is standing as an Independent.

HARRABY, Carlisle city council; caused by the death of Labour councillor Dave Weedall, who was first elected to the council in 1967, at the age of 77.

The Harraby ward is essentially south-eastern Carlisle along the A6 London Road.  Much of this area on the fringes of the city is post-war housing and relatively high up the indices of multiple deprivation, although there are some nicer areas at the very edge of the built-up area.

Carlisle's city wards have the same boundaries as the city's Cumbria county council divisions, so this area goes to the polls every year.  The picture this gives us is of a safe Labour area with a respectable Conservative vote in second place; the narrowest result in recent years was in 2008 when the Labour majority was 172 votes.  Since the formation of the Coalition the Conservative vote here has gone into serious decline and the ward has become very safe for Labour.

Labour's candidate in the by-election is Don Forrester, who lives in Wetheral.  He is opposed by Keith Meller for the Conservatives, a businessman from Irthington who also fought the Castle ward county by-election in March; Eddie Haughan, from Scotby, who came third in May standing for UKIP and is trying again; James Tucker for the Green Party, the only candidate to live within the city, who fought Denton Holme ward in May; and Michael Gee, from Dalston, for the Liberal Democrats, who finished last in this ward last month.

EARITH, Huntingdonshire district council, Cambridgeshire; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Philip Godfrey.

We move to the Fens to arrive in Earith ward, a ward consisting of four villages on or just off the A1123 Huntingdon-Soham road.  At the eastern end is Earith, once the most easterly village in the old county of Huntingdonshire, on the north bank of the River Great Ouse.  Further to the west is Bluntisham, probably the largest village in the ward and once home to the crime writer Dorothy L Sayers, whose father was the rector.  Continuing west are the twin villages of Holywell and Needingworth; the Old Ferry Boat Inn in Holywell is one of several claimants to the title of UK's oldest pub.  

In 2010 a small part of the west end of the ward was transferred to St Ives South ward after the town of St Ives outgrew its parish boundary; this means that results prior to 2010 are not directly comparable.

This ward has always been a very safe Conservative area, with big majorities at every election since 2004 (including a previous by-election in October 2006).  At his most recent re-election in 2011 Philip Godfrey had 61.7% of the vote over a fractured opposition; Labour beat the Lib Dems into third place that year.  Holywell-cum-Needingworth parish is part of the safe Conservative St Ives county division, while the other two villages are covered by the even safer Somersham and Earith county division, and the ward is part of the safe Conservative parliamentary seat of North West Cambridgeshire.

The Conservatives have selected Robin Carter, from Bluntisham, as their candidate to succeed Philip Godfrey.  The Labour and Lib Dem candidates from 2011, Iain Ramsbottom and Tony Hulme respectively, are both standing again; they both give addresses in Somersham ward, just to the north.  The UKIP candidate is Alan Fitzgerald from Bluntisham; while UKIP have county and district councillors in Huntingdonshire this is not a strong ward for them.  The ballot paper is completed by a shadow minister; Lord Toby Jug, the Shadow Minister for Rock and Roll and Tea Drinking and a St Ives resident, is the Official Monster Raving Loony Party candidate.

NORTON, Dudley metropolitan borough council, West Midlands; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Angus Adams at the age of 67.  A former nuts and bolts salesman, Adams was the chairman of Centro, the West Midlands passenger transport authority.

"'Or take Golf', said Mr Carmody, side-stepping and attacking from another angle.  'The only good golf-course in Worcestershire at present is at Stourbridge.'"
  -PG Wodehouse, Money for Nothing

Some things have changed since Wodehouse's day, with Stourbridge having now been removed from Worcestershire into the West Midlands metropolitan county.  Stourbridge Golf Course can now be found within the Norton ward of the Metropolitan Borough of Dudley, which is essentially the south-western end of the town of Stourbridge.  Hard up against the Green Belt, this ward contains some of the most desirable residential areas in the whole of the West Midlands.

Unsurprisingly given this, Norton is a safe Conservative ward, but it was not always so.  Until 2003 this ward regularly elected Liberal Democrat councillors, but in 2004 when Dudley's ward boundaries were redrawn (although Norton ward escaped unchanged) the Conservatives narrowly won all three seats, Angus Adams winning the final seat by just 53 votes over the Lib Dems.  Since then the Lib Dem challenge has faded badly and last month they finished fourth behind Labour and UKIP.

On those figures the Conservative candidate Colin Elcock should have little trouble winning the by-election; he is retired after working for many years in the drinks industry, and fought Cradley and Wollescote ward last month.  Labour have selected Brierley Hill-based Adnan Rashid, while the Liberal Democrats have gone for their former Norton councillor, retired teacher and solicitor Christopher Bramall who is their regular Stourbridge parliamentary candidate; last month he fought Wollaston and Stourbridge Town ward.  Three minor party candidates have also been nominated: Benjamin Sweeney for the Green Party who finished last in this ward in May's election, former RAF fireman Glen Wilson for UKIP, and Kevin Inman of Upper Gornal for the National Front.

ESHER, Elmbridge district council, Surrey; a postponed poll from May following the death of Bruce King who had been nominated as the Labour candidate.

We move from West Midlands suburbia to London suburbia for the final contest in this preview, which is also the last word on the May 2012 local elections.

The town of Esher (pronounced EE-sher) grew up as a stagecoach stop on the old London-Portsmouth road, and was once home to a royal residence: Clive of India's mansion Claremont, at various times used by Queen Victoria, King Louis-Philippe of France and Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg, later King of the Belgians, and now used as a school.  Much of the grounds of Claremont (laid out by some of Britain's most famous landscape gardeners) are now National Trust property, and there is much woodland in the south of the ward, the Esher and West End Commons.  The town itself occupies the centre of the ward, and the most notable features of the ward's northern end are the town's railway station on the South Western main line (half-hourly trains to Waterloo) and the Sandown Park racecourse, home to the Eclipse Stakes in early July each year.

Esher has a reputation as a very prosperous middle-class area, and this was reinforced by the early 1990s sitcom On the Up, which was set in Esher and starred Dennis Waterman as a self-made millionaire.  The politics of the area also reflect this, as Esher is within the part of Surrey in which Residents Associations are a major force in local politics.  The Esher Residents Association are not one of the stronger ones electorally, and although they normally poll a very respectable vote (41.5% at the most recent election in 2011) they have not won this ward since 2002 and the ward has a full slate of Conservative councillors.  Esher does, however, have a Residents Association county councillor who represents the East Molesey and Esher county division.  The Residents don't stand at parliamentary level and Esher and Walton is a very safe Conservative constituency.

The Conservative councillor up for re-election is solicitor Tim Oliver, who won a by-election in June 2009 after the previous Tory councillor resigned due to pressure of business; he was a member of the Elmbridge cabinet last year.  Gary Lay is standing for the Esher Residents Association.  The new Labour candidate is Mick Moriarty, who fought this ward from 2002 to 2004, and Denis Hill has been attracted by the postponement to stand for UKIP; he is the only candidate not to live in the ward, giving an address in Thames Ditton.
