So, politics is back with a vengeance with the kids back to school, the summer holidays over and the party activists getting ready for the conference season.  Nick Clegg has been under a bit of pressure recently, and if he was looking for succour in by-election gains this week he will be disappointed, as all three of this week's by-elections are Liberal Democrat defences; while they all look pretty safe on paper there is always the potential to shock.  There is a double contest in Lincolnshire which we will come to later, but first we travel to the hinterland of Bristol.

DODINGTON, South Gloucestershire council; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Dafydd Holbrook.

"Y is for Yate, the kind of town that referees come from."
- Half Man Half Biscuit, "The Referee's Alphabet"

Most of the time wards have names which give you a good clue as to where they are and what areas they cover; sometimes the name is no help; sometimes the name is downright misleading.  Dodington ward falls into the misleading category, as it doesn't include the village of the same name (2.5 miles south-east of Chipping Sodbury) or indeed much of the parish of the same name, the rural part of which falls within Westerleigh ward.  Instead, this Dodington ward is essentially a southern extension of Yate that has outgrown the town boundary, based on the Shire Way estate and the Abbotswood area on Rodford Way.

Yate has experienced a lot of population growth over the years as it has evolved from a small Gloucestershire town with some manufacturing into essentially a Bristol commuter town.  Its growth was recognised by the last Parliamentary boundary commission, which for the first time gave it a place in a constituency name (Thornbury and Yate).

Thornbury and Yate, like the predecessor seat of Northavon, is a Liberal Democrat stronghold and in 2010 re-elected for a fourth term Steve Webb, now a junior minister with responsibility for pensions.  The Lib Dem strength goes down to local level with a stranglehold on most of the constituency's wards, and Yate is one of their strongest areas in the country.  The Dodington ward swung strongly towards the Lib Dems at the last election in 2011, with Holbrook topping the poll.

Defending the seat for the Liberal Democrats is Tony Davis, who fought the hopeless ward of Frenchay and Stoke Park last year.  He is one of three Yate-based candidates for the three main parties, the other two being Kate Duffy for the Conservatives and Michael McGrath (who fought Yate North last year) for Labour.  The local UKIP branch appear to be concentrating on a town council by-election in Bradley Stoke on the same day, but not to be left out they have nominated Aaron Foot who gives an address some distance away in the village of Wick.

NETTLEHAM AND SAXILBY, Lincolnshire County Council; and NETTLEHAM, West Lindsey district council, Lincolnshire; both caused by the death of Liberal Democrat councillor Ray Sellars at the age of 72.

We move to Lincolnshire to a rural area which wraps around the north of Lincoln.

The Nettleham ward is based on the large village of the same name to the north-east of Lincoln, which was the site of the palace of the Bishops of Lincoln until the Lincolnshire Rising of 1536 trashed it.  Today the ward's economy is based on rather more modern things, with an oil well operating south of the village.  As well as Nettleham, the ward covers the parishes of Greetwell to the south and Grange de Lings and Riseholme to the west; Riseholme is the home of Riseholme College, an agricultural science college which is part of Lincoln University.

The county division of Nettleham and Saxilby continues to the west across Ermine Street and down the cliff into Saxilby ward, named after the large village on the A57 Lincoln-Worksop road and the Lincoln-Gainsborough railway line (roughly hourly trains to Lincoln and Sheffield plus occasional services to Doncaster).  The Saxilby ward also includes five other parishes.

West Lindsey used to elect by thirds but went over to whole council elections from last year.  Nettleham ward has voted Lib Dem at every election since 2002 when the ward went Independent - and that Independent councillor was re-elected as a Liberal Democrat in 2006.  The majorities have generally been safe except in 2008, when the Lib Dem majority was suddenly cut to just nine votes; the Conservative candidate Giles McNeill could probably curse the intervention of UKIP, who stood here for the first time that year and polled 46 votes.  McNeill has stood here at each election since with diminishing returns.  Ray Sellars, already the county councillor, was elected here for the first time in 2011.

Saxilby ward re-elected its two councillors in 2011 with a C/LD split, but the winning Conservative candidate Jackie Brockway had originally been elected in 2007 as a Liberal Democrat (defeating McNeill).  This ward also hides a close result in its past, with a Conservative majority of fifteen votes in the 2003 election; that was a straight fight with Labour, who haven't stood for the ward since.

The two wards add up to a county division which is safe for the Lib Dems, their lead over the Conservatives being 61-34 at the 2009 election.

The county ballot paper has some interesting names.  Charles Shaw, who wasn't that far off winning Lincoln East at the 2009 county election, is the defending Liberal Democrat.  His main challenge will come from Saxilby district councillor and ex-Lib Dem Jackie Brockway.  Labour have selected Richard Coupland who, like Shaw, is based in Lincoln.  Three other candidates have also come out of the woodwork: Elliott Fountain of the English Democrats has come from the other side of the county in Boston, Howard Thompson is standing for UKIP and David Watson for the well-organised county council group Lincolnshire Independents.

In the Nettleham by-election Guy Grainger defends the Lib Dems' district council seat; he lives in Market Rasen and fought Middle Rasen ward last year.  Giles McNeill is having his fourth crack at the ward as the Conservative candidate, and the ballot paper is completed by UKIP's Howard Thompson, the only candidate to stand in both by-elections.
