28th July sees six by-elections take place, all in London and eastern England.  Labour have one defence in the suburbs of Leicester, the Lib Dems will try to hang on to two seats in Chelmsford, while the Conservatives defend one seat in Leicestershire, one in Northamptonshire and one in Kensington, which is the subject of this week's first preview.

BROMPTON, Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, North London; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Baroness Ritchie of Brompton, who was the cabinet member for family and children's services, at the age of 62.  Outside politics she is probably best known for being the stepmother of Guy Ritchie, successful film director and ex-husband of Madonna.

Welcome to one of the most touristy areas in the whole of London.  If you've been to Harrods, you've been here.  If you've been to the Brompton Oratory, one of London's most famous Catholic churches, you've been here; the Oratory's church hall is one of the polling stations for this by-election.  If you've been to any of the cluster of museums around Exhibition Road in South Kensington (the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Science Museum, the Natural History Museum) you've been here.  This is one of those long thin wards, with its core lying one or two blocks south of Brompton Road or Old Brompton Road between the Scotch House junction and Queens Gate.  Most of the ward is within the SW7 postcode district (South Kensington) with parts in SW3 (Chelsea) and SW1 (Westminster), and the ward is served by two Underground stations: Knightsbridge (on the Piccadilly Line) and South Kensington (on the Circle, District and Piccadilly Lines).

Any area where the local shop is Harrods is going to be rich.  While these sort of statistics aren't generally available at ward level, the 2011 ASHE income survey found that the Kensington parliamentary constituency as a whole was by far the highest-earning constituency in the UK, with a median employed gross income of £788 per week (the median for the UK as a whole is £404 per week).  This combined with the 2001 census statistics suggest that Brompton ward has become a popular area for high-earning immigrants to the UK, the last census finding that 36% of the ward's population were born outside the EU-15, the largest single contingent from the USA (almost 1,000 people in total).  Many of those, of course, won't be eligible to vote in the by-election.

These demographic and economic indicators indicate that Brompton ward isn't dissimilar to the Kensington constituency as a whole.  Kensington is a very low-turnout constituency where the Conservative vote can be weighed rather than counted, and similarly Brompton ward is extremely safe; last month Boris Johnson polled 77% of the vote here, and the Tories had 67% at the last council election in 2010 and polled 80% at a by-election in June last year after the death of one of their other councillors.  Shireen Ritchie (as she was then) beat the alphabet to come top of the poll in 2010, and was awarded a peerage a few weeks afterwards.

The Conservative candidate in the by-election very much fits the stereotype described above; he is Abbas Barkhordar, an Iranian-born banker with Schroders, who lives in West Kensington.  His competition will come from Mark Sautter of Labour, a chartered accountant, who was a distant runner-up in last year's by-election; Moya Denman from the Lib Dems who is the only candidate to live in the ward; and Notting Hill-based David Coburn from UKIP who are fighting the ward for the first time.

CHELMSFORD NORTH, Essex county council; and PATCHING HALL, Chelmsford city council, Essex; both caused by the death of Liberal Democrat councillor Tom Smith-Hughes at the age of 63.  A retired economist, he was Leader of the Opposition on the county council.

It's a strange coincidence that the day of the last by-election in Brompton ward, Kensington (8th June 2011) also saw a Lib Dem defence in a Chelmsford division of Essex county council.  That was in Chelmsford Central and resulted in a Conservative gain.  An omen perhaps?

This time the Lib Dems are defending Chelmsford North, which is actually the north-western end of the Jubilee city of Chelmsford and would appear to be mostly housingestateland with few distinguishing features.  There is also a district by-election in Patching Hall, one of the two Chelmsford city wards covered by the county division, which can be found on the Broomfield road and is a slightly older area, Patching having a Domesday book entry.  The other ward covered by the county division is St Andrew's, named after the parish church on Chignall Road.

Previous results in Patching Hall shows that the Lib Dems have a fight on their hands to keep the district council seat.  The 2003, 2007 and 2011 elections have all had basically the same result, with a personal vote for Tom Smith-Hughes at the top of the poll but the third Lib Dem seat being won by not all that much over the Conservatives (35 votes in 2003, 115 votes in 2007, 44 votes in 2011).  The county division looks safer on paper, with a 759-vote majority for Smith-Hughes at his final re-election in 2009, but since 2011 the Lib Dems no longer have a full slate of district councillors for the division as the Conservatives gained one of the three seats in St Andrew's ward last year.

For the district by-election the Liberal Democrats have selected Paul Bentham, a healthcare worker and local school governor.  The Tory candidate is Stephen Fowell, who fought this ward in 2010 and was 64 votes away from election.  Also on the ballot paper are Chris Vince, a secondary school teacher from Springfield, for Labour; Reza Hossain for the Green Party; and Ian Nicholls for UKIP.

The county by-election has higher-profile candidates, with the defending Lib Dem being Patching Hall ward councillor Stephen Robinson who came very close to winning the Chelmsford parliamentary seat in 2010.  For this by-election the Conservatives have selected Robert Pontin, who stood down from the district council last year after one term as councillor for Moulsham and Central ward.  Workshop teacher Nastassia Player is standing for Labour, Reza Hossain again for the Greens and Leslie Retford for UKIP.

GRANGE PARK, South Northamptonshire district council; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Paul Farrow who was vice-chairman of the council.

Grange Park is a sizeable village just south of Northampton, with 3,058 electors shown on the 2011 local government register.  It has excellent road connections, being just off the M1 motorway at junction 15.  So, why doesn't it appear in my 2011 AA road atlas?

The answer to this is simple and very interesting: it's an almost completely new village, mostly developed in the last decade.  The 2001 census found just 327 people living in the parish.  Two years later there were 2375 registered electors, and the district ward that contained the village (Courteenhall, with two councillors) had grown so much that the entire district had to have new ward boundaries.  Grange Park became a ward of its own, with two councillors of its own, in 2007.

The age of the area means that there are few reliable statistics, but with such a recent private development you'd expect a relatively prosperous demographic.  That would appear to be borne out by the ward's election results; the Conservatives were unopposed here in 2007 (South Northants is one of those councils that has lots of unopposed returns), beat the Lib Dems 76-24 in a 2009 by-election and beat a single Independent candidate 75-25 at the 2011 election.

This by-election, like the 2009 one, is a straight fight between the Conservatives and Lib Dems.  The Tory candidate is a former councillor for this ward: Tharik Jainu-Deen is seeking to return to the council after standing down last year.  He is opposed by Liberal Democrat candidate Shaun Hope, who lives in the nearby village of Milton Malsor.

RAVENHURST AND FOSSE, Blaby district council, Leicestershire; caused by the death of Labour councillor Phil Fox at the age of 66.  A retired teacher and published poet, he had served as a Blaby district and Braunstone town councillor since 1995 and had been leader of the Labour group on the district council.

(I am grateful to LeicesterLad from the Vote UK forum for background information on this election.  LeicesterLad is the election agent for the Conservative candidate in the by-election.)

From Grange Park it's seven junctions up the M1 to junction 21 for Leicester.  At this point we are at the edge of the built-up area of Leicester but not at the city limits, as there are several suburbs of Leicester which have never been annexed by the city.  Some of these form the basis for the Blaby local government district, which in addition to Blaby itself includes such towns as Narborough, Enderby, Braunstone Town and Glenfield, the home of Leicestershire county council, together with a small rural area.  

From junction 21 in order to reach Leicester city centre it's necessary to travel up the Fosse Way through Braunstone Town, and this is where you will find the Ravenhurst and Fosse ward, which straddles the Fosse Way and is hard up against the effectively indistinguishable city boundary.

Poltically the name of Blaby will forever be associated with Nigel Lawson, whose constituency this was.  There is no a longer a Blaby constituency, the name having been changed to South Leicestershire in 2010 after the Boundary Commission realised that not many people knew where Blaby is.  The name may have changed but the seat is still substantially the same as it was in Lawson's day, although the safe Conservative nature of the parliamentary seat masks a more mixed political pattern on the district council, on which the Conservatives lead in Narborough, Enderby, Leicester Forest East and the rural wards, the Lib Dems do well in Blaby, Glen Parva and Glenfield, and Labour have a stronghold in Braunstone Town where they hold the county council seat and six of the seven district council seats; the county councillor is Phil Fox' widow.

Three of those Labour seats are returned by Ravenhurst and Fosse ward, where the Conservatives are getting further and further away from fielding a full slate, getting down to one candidate last year.  The ward was fairly close in 2007 (Labour majorities 140, 72 and 34) but Labour pulled away in 2011 and made the ward safe again.

The by-election is a straight Labour/Conservative fight.  The Labour candidate Sam Maxwell is a town councillor for part of the ward and a former mayor of Braunstone Town.  Against him the Conservatives have decided to give some electoral experience to 22-year-old Michael Potter, from Narborough.

SILEBY, Charnwood district council, Leicestershire; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Roy Brown at the age of 65.  A long-serving Barrow and Sileby parish councillor, he had served with the Leicestershire Regiment in Aden, Malta and Bahrain, and was Mayor of Charnwood in 2009/10.

Moving from south-west of Leicester to north of Leicester and the large village of Sileby, the venue for the final by-election this week.  Seven miles north of Leicester, the village boomed in the later industrial revolution thanks to its position on the Midland main line, with factories making boots, shoes and hosiery and also clay pits.  Today Sileby railway station has hourly trains on the Ivanhoe line, running south to Leicester and north to Loughborough and Nottingham.  The ward doesn't contain the whole of Sileby, part of the village being included in the Barrow and Sileby West ward.

The village's position on a commuter railway line makes it a desirable area and this is a safe Conservative ward on Charnwood district council, the Tories beating Labour at last year's council election by 65-35.

The by-election sees four candidates.  Former Conservative district councillor and current parish councillor Ken Jones, an ex-manager at a local factory, is back on the ballot paper after standing down in 2011.  The Labour candidate is Richard Watson, a local painter and decorator, who finished last in 2011.  Also standing are Stephen Coltman for the Liberal Democrats, who lives in Loughborough, and the BNP's Charnwood organiser Stephen Denham, from the nearby village of Syston.
