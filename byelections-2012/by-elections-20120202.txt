Again just one by-election this week, and we're off to rural Staffordshire.

MADELEY, Newcastle under Lyme, Staffordshire; caused by the death of Labour councillor Bill Sinnott.

Madeley ward is a place which many people pass through but few stop at.  It can be found 5 miles west of Newcastle-under-Lyme town centre on the A525 Newcastle-Whitchurch road; the main village of Madeley lies on the West Coast Main Line, although there has not been a station here for many years, while to the east of the village the M6 motorway makes a 120-degree curve from west to north-east as it bypasses the Potteries conurbation.  The ward also includes the villages of Little Madeley and Madeley Heath either side of the motorway.  Famous residents in the ward, according to Wikipedia, are Gordon Banks and Lemmy from Motörhead.

Although the ward looks fairly prosperous according to the deprivation indices, it has a coal-mining history, with collieries once upon a time at Madeley and Leycett; nearby was Silverdale Colliery which remained open until 1998.  It's probably this, rather than Keele University being in the next ward, which accounts for the fact that the ward was fairly safe Labour when the current ward boundaries came in in 2002.

The Labour majority dwindled during the later Blair years, and in 2006 Labour won by 29 votes over the Conservatives with the Lib Dems 46 votes further behind.  The Tories gained the ward from Bill Sinnott in 2007 by a margin of 92 over both the Lib Dems and Labour, who tied for second place.  Strangely, the Tories did not follow up with a gain of the other seat on general election day in 2010; even though this ward is part of the safe Conservative parliamentary seat of Stone, the Lib Dems inexplicably made the gain from Labour by 131 votes over the Conservatives, Labour finishing a poor third.  Last year Bill Sinnott gained his seat back from the Conservatives with a majority of 38, the Lib Dems being back in third place.

These wild swings - in the last three elections the ward has voted for all three main parties - make the by-election rather tricky to call.  Much will depend on the campaign, in which all three main parties have selected local candidates.  Defending the seat for the Labour is John Smart, about whom I have no information, while the other two main candidates both have some recent entertainment experience; the Lib Dem candidate, guest-house owner Simon White, appeared last year on the Channel 4 show "Four in a Bed", in which guest-house owners take turns to stay with each other; while the Conservatives' standard-bearer, computer engineer Howard Goodall, is a member of the Stoke Repertory Players, whose production last week was 'Fur Coat and No Knickers'.  Insert your own joke here.  Completing the ballot paper is Elaine Blake of UKIP; UKIP have a very active and successful branch in Newcastle-under-Lyme but in this ward have always been also-rans.
