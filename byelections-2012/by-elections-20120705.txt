In one of the busiest by-election nights of the year, nine polls will take place on 5th July.  There is something for everyone here with all three main parties plus the Greens having seats to defend.   The Greens are defending their redoubt in the Malvern Hills; the Lib Dems will try to hang on to wards which last month voted overwhelmingly for the Tory candidate for Mayor of London and the Labour candidate for Mayor of Liverpool; Labour will hope to elect a successor to take on the council seat vacated by the new Mayor of Liverpool and are also defending a ward in Chesterfield; while the Conservatives have four wards to worry about, two in Kent, one on the Essex coast and one on the Lancashire coast.  

There is a Western theme to this week's contests, with polls in the Kent towns of Westgate-on-Sea and West Malling, the West ward of the Worcestershire town of Malvern and two wards on the west coast of England, one of which has a connection to the West's fastest milkcart...


HEYHOUSES, Fylde district council, Lancashire; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Peter Wood due to pressure of work.

We're in the coastal resort town of St Annes on the Sea here, a planned Victorian resort just south of Blackpool which has fused with the neighbouring older town of Lytham to form the larger town of Lytham St Annes.  The Heyhouses ward, named after one of the hamlets that was here among the sand dunes before the town of St Annes was developed, is on the landward side of town.  The northern half of the ward is Lytham Moss, a low-lying and rich agricultural area.  In the middle is the ward's population, centred around some large Government buildings off Heyhouses Lane which were once the home of ERNIE, the random number generator that determined each month's Premium Bond winners.  (The original ERNIE is now on display in the Science Museum, for which see the Brompton ward preview from last week.)  At the southern end of the ward, adjoining the useless railway line to Blackpool South, is more open space: the Royal Lytham and St Annes Golf Club, which will host the 2012 Open Championship in two weeks' time.

Lytham St Annes has a reputation as a retirement area and also as a wealthy area, with many people living here who work in the aerospace industry at Warton, on the road to Preston.  Stereotypically this results in a Tory ward with the Lib Dems running second; although the St Annes Tories performed rather poorly in 2009 and lost one of the town's two Lancashire county divisions to the Lib Dems (however, that was St Annes North which does not include this ward), they got a swing in their favour in 2011 compared to the previous district election.

Peter Wood's resignation cost the Tories their majority on Fylde district council, so they will be desperate to hold the seat.  They have selected Barbara Nash, a careers consultant who is married to a Fylde district and St Annes town councillor; she fought Ashton ward in last year's district election.  On paper her main opposition will come from the Lib Dems' Carol Gilligan, a businesswoman who came last in St John's ward last year.  Four other candidates have come out of the woodwork: Ian Roberts of the Green Party who is campaigning against the shale gas drilling/fracking in the Fylde and did pretty well here in the last St Annes town council election; Bill Dickson of UKIP; independent candidate Palmira Stafford, a local businesswoman who is involved with several local organisations; and Bill Whitehead, who was a UKIP candidate in the last Lancashire county council election, is standing under the banner of "Integrity UK".  There are more detailed profiles of the candidates at <http://www.counterbalance.org.uk/latest/heyhrr.htm>.

ALLERTON AND HUNTS CROSS and RIVERSIDE, both Liverpool city council; caused respectively by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Vera Best due to poor health and by the election of Labour councillor Joe Anderson as Mayor of Liverpool.  Vera Best has since died.

(My thanks to Richard Marbrow for help with this preview.)

The Allerton and Hunts Cross ward can be found in southern Liverpool and consists of three separate areas around Clark Gardens in the centre of the ward; part of Allerton to the north-west (much of the Allerton area is in the neighbouring Church ward), Hunts Cross to the south-east and part of Woolton to the north-east.  The deprivation indices give a mixed picture of the ward, with Allerton near the bottom of the indices, Woolton mostly in the top half and the rest somewhere in between - so, overall pretty middle-class and affluent by Liverpool standards.  The area is well-connected with two railway stations, the new intercity station of Liverpool South Parkway (formerly Allerton) at the south-west corner, and Hunts Cross station which is the southern terminus of the Merseyrail Northern Line.

Allerton and Hunts Cross was a Lib Dem ward.  I say 'was' because this is Liverpool, and the way the Liberal Democrat vote in Liverpool and the surrounding area has simply evaporated since the formation of the Coalition is a sight to behold.  The Lib Dems polled 63.2% when the ward was created in 2004, and as recently as 2008 the Lib Dems had 48.6% of the vote here to 20.7% for Labour in third place thanks to that rare sight, a second-placed finish for the Conservatives in Liverpool.  By then the shine had already started to come off the Liberal Democrat administration in Liverpool, and it took a defection for the party to hold on to overall control after the 2008 elections.  In hindsight, this was probably not a wise move as the Lib Dem administration became more and more controversial under its leader Warren Bradley (who was recently fined £1000 for perjury after falsely nominating his son to stand in the 2011 election).  Labour took overall control of the council in 2010 and came to within five points in this ward, Vera Best being re-elected.  At this point the wheels really started to come off the Lib Dem bus with the national picture being added to the local picture, the formation of the Coalition going down like a lead balloon in this determinedly anti-Tory city.  In the 2011 elections Labour won here with 55.2% to 26.7% for the Lib Dems, and increased their lead in May to 62-18. 

The main personal beneficiary of the Lib Dem collapse was the Labour group leader Joe Anderson, who became Leader of the Council in 2010 as Labour gained overall control of the city, and was convincingly elected Mayor in May, polling 59% of first preferences with no other candidate getting more than 8.5%.  His Riverside ward includes some of the most famous areas of the city, running south from the edge of the city centre to take in the Albert Dock and all the tourist sights that implies, Chinatown, the Anglican cathedral, Dingle and so on.  The ward includes Liverpool Central railway station and Brunswick station, the next stop down the Northern line.  However, most of the ward's population live in the notorious byword for urban deprivation that is Toxteth.  Any ward that includes Toxteth is going to be safe Labour, and the Labour vote has grown from 57% in 2004 to 81% last May, the Lib Dems failing to stand a candidate.

You'd have to make Labour favourites in both by-elections, although Allerton and Hunts Cross has more at stake with the Lib Dems defending their last seat in this ward.  Their candidate is Mirna Juarez, who is opposed by Labour's Rachael O'Byrne, a sabbatical officer at Liverpool Hope University and daughter of a council cabinet member.  Also standing are Chris Hall for the Conservatives, the regular Green Party candidate Maggie Williams, the regular Liberal Party candidate Christopher Hulme, and Lynne Wild under the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition (TUSC) label.

In Riverside ward the Labour party have selected Hetty Wood to fill Joe Anderson's council seat, which he had to give up upon election as Mayor; she would appear to be a qualified barrister on the executive of the Young Fabians.  Her opposition comes from Peter Cranie who fought the ward in May for the Green Party, Alma McGing who tried here in 2011 for the Tories, Chris McDermott for TUSC and the Lib Dems' Nicola Beckett.

ST HELEN'S, Chesterfield borough council, Derbyshire; caused by the death of Labour councillor Trevor Reynolds at the age of 69.

From a council on the west side of the Pennines which has seen a spectacular Lib Dem collapse in recent years, we move to the other side of the Pennines to a not dissimilar area electorally.  This is Chesterfield, the largest town in Derbyshire now that Derby has gone unitary.  The St Helen's ward of Chesterfield lies immediately north of the town centre along the Sheffield Road, and includes the town's college.  This is generally a working-class part of a rather socially divided town.

Chesterfield council had a big Lib Dem majority in 2003 and 2007, following on from their gain of the parliamentary seat in 2001, but Labour recovered the parliamentary seat in 2010 and turned the council round in 2011 to secure a big majority of their own.  With most of the wards being straight Lib Dem/Labour fights, this required an enormous swing to gain a very large number of seats.  St Helen's was one of the wards Labour gained last year, winning 61-39 after losing in 2007 by 35-65.

The by-election sees Tom Murphy standing for Labour against a split in the Lib Dem camp; Tony Rogers is the official Liberal Democrat while Keith Lomas, a former councillor for this ward, has gone off to stand for UKIP after failing to get the Lib Dem nomination.  Also on the ballot paper are Shelley Dale for the Conservatives, who rarely contest local elections in Chesterfield, and the Green Party's Kate Barker.

GROVE, Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames, South London; caused by the resignation of Marc Woodall, a Liberal Democrat councillor, to take up a politically restricted post with Surrey county council.

For the week's final by-election with serious Lib Dem interest, we move down to the London suburb of Kingston upon Thames.  The Grove ward covers the town centre, running south from the railway station along the riverfront past the town hall, Surrey County Hall and Kingston University.  Several Saxon kings were crowned here in days of olden time, and as a result the town has the status of a Royal Borough.

This is quite a safe Lib Dem ward at local level, returning a full slate of Lib Dem councillors at every opportunity since 2002, including a November 2004 by-election.  The closest result in recent years was in 2006 when the Lib Dems beat the Conservatives 43-32; in 2010 their lead increased to 44-27.  The Green Party normally run third here over Labour.  Even at the GLA elections in May, when the Lib Dem vote went into meltdown, they held up enough here to finish a respectable third on the list vote with 18% (to 31% for the Conservatives and 23% for Labour).  Boris beat Ken here 48-26.

Rebekah Moll, an intern for the local MP Ed Davey, is defending the council seat for the Lib Dems.  The Conservatives have made an interesting choice of candidate in criminal barrister Adrian Amer, who stood here against Norman Lamont as a Liberal Party candidate in the 1992 general election.  The Greens have selected 19-year-old Ryan Coley, while retired charity worker Laurie South is the Labour candidate.  Also on the ballot paper are David Child for the BNP, Jonathan Rudd of the Christian People's Alliance and Michael Watson who is standing for UKIP.

TOLLESBURY, Maldon district council, Essex; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Russell Porter at the age of 63.  Fluent in several languages, former councillor Porter was working on twinning Maldon with the Belarus city of Brest, and in recognition of this the Belarussian government was intending to appoint him as a consul.

The village of Tollesbury can be found on the marshy Essex coast, at the end of the northern bank of the Blackwater estuary.  Much of the marsh is a site of special scientific interest (Tollesbury Wick Marshes) and the shallow marshy waters are the source of the village's main export: oysters.

The ward was for some years represented by Independent councillor Ron Laurie who was re-elected with big majorities until he retired in 2011, leaving his seat open.  The result was a surprisingly close contest between Russell Porter for the Tories and Stevan Slodzik for Labour, this not being the sort of area where you would expect a high Labour vote (Labour polled 8% in the wider Heybridge and Tollesbury county division in 2009).

In the by-election the new Tory candidate is local farmer and keen conversationist Andrew St Joseph, who picked up an award from a German national park a couple of months ago for his part in research on wetland birds.  Stefan Slodzik is trying again for Labour after his good result last year, and Gerald Munson, the chairman of the neighbouring Tolleshunt D'Arcy parish council, is standing as an independent.  Scanned election leaflets from all three candidates can be found at <http://tollesbury.weebly.com/diary.html>.

WEST, Malvern Hills district council, Worcestershire; caused by the resignation of councillor Luna Deller of the Green Party, who is moving to Kuala Lumpur.

From the marshes of Essex to a complete contrast: the Malvern Hills, which rise on the boundary of this ward to Worcestershire Beacon, the highest point of Worcestershire at an altitude of 425 metres, from which nineteen counties can be seen on the clearest of days.  The view at the top of Worcestershire Beacon is described on a toposcope designed by Arthur Troyte Griffiths, the inspiration of one of Elgar's Enigma variations; Elgar lived in the Malvern area for many years and is buried in Little Malvern.  On the east flank is the spa town of Great Malvern, while on the western slopes can be found the village of West Malvern after which West ward is named; the ward also runs around the north end of the hills to include the north of the town of Great Malvern.

For some reason this ward has become the Green Party's stronghold in Worcestershire; the ward's two seats split Green/Lib Dem in 2003, then Green/Conservative in 2007.  Last year the Greens stood two candidates here and won both seats, with the Conservatives not far behind.  This sets up an interesting by-election.

The Greens have selected Malvern town councillor Julian Roskams, who is endorsed by the Liberal Democrats who are not standing in the by-election.  The Conservatives have selected Jennie Kelly, who lost her seat here last year.  Also on the ballot paper are Mike Savage of UKIP, who is the chairman of a local airfield and runs a computer company, Labour's Chris Burrows, a teacher, and independent candidate Sarah Rouse.

WEST MALLING AND LEYBOURNE, Tonbridge and Malling borough council, Kent; caused by the death of the Leader of the Council, Conservative councillor Mark Worrall.

The final two by-elections this week are in Kent, and we start in the interior with a poll in West Malling and Leybourne ward.  West Malling is a historic market town on the old road and railway line from London to Maidstone and Ashford (two trains per hour to Maidstone and Victoria) and has consequently become popular with commuters.  Closer to the M20 motorway, Leybourne has been strongly developed in recent years and has now merged into the larger Maidstone conurbation.  It's a measure of how much development has taken place in the area that both West Malling and Leybourne have been bypassed in the last ten years.

With that sort of recent, affluent demographic it's no surprise to find out that the ward is safe Conservative, the party getting a good swing in their favour in 2011 partly thanks to an intervention by Labour, who didn't stand here in 2007.  It's slightly more surprising to find out that West Malling itself is part of a Lib Dem county council division (Malling Central) although that's because the rest of the county division covers the strongly Lib Dem areas of East Malling and Larkfield.  Leybourne is included within the safe Tory Malling North division on the county council.

The Tories are standing Sophie Shrubsole for the by-election and on paper she should have little trouble being returned; she lives in Leybourne and works for Westminster Business Council.  The Liberal Democrats have reselected West Malling resident Yvonne Smyth who was their top candidate here last year, Labour have gone for Kathleen Garlick who last year fought the neighbouring new development of Kings Hill, and UKIP are standing Peter Stevens who finished last in this ward in 2011.  Also standing are Howard Porter of the Green Party and Michael Walters of the English Democrats, who is the only candidate to give an address outside the local area, living in Rochester.

WESTGATE-ON-SEA, Thanet district council, Kent; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Brian Goodwin.

We finish this week's previews as we started: in a Victorian seaside resort, in this developed in the 1860s as a resort intended for the upper- to middle-classes of London, linked to London by the Chatham railway line (hourly trains to Victoria, taking ages).  Perhaps because of the proximity of Margate, of which Westgate-on-Sea is the western end, this wasn't entirely successful; the proprietors going bust in 1884 and the area ending up in the hands of Coutts' bank can't have helped.  Although the ward's deprivation profile is a bit better than Margate as a whole, that's nothing to shout out about.

Nonetheless this is normally a Conservative ward and part of a pretty safe Conservative county division (Margate West) in which UKIP ran second in 2009.  Since 2007 the Conservatives have shared representation of the ward with Independent councillor Thomas King, who topped the poll last year.

Both the Conservatives and Labour have selected fairly young candidates.  The Tories are running James Maskell, a shop assistant and former school governor who blogs at <http://villeviews.blogspot.co.uk/>, while Labour have selected the current mayoress of Margate, 28-year-old mother of two Jodie Hibbert.  There are two rival independent candidates standing, cafe owner Ash Ashbee who was runner-up in Birchington North ward last year, and Claire Mendelsohn, a holistic therapist from Ramsgate who is endorsed by the Thanet Independent Group, which supports Labour in its minority administration running Thanet council (but doesn't include Thomas King).  Jeff Elenor, a retired civil servant, is standing for UKIP and the Lib Dems are fighting the ward for the first time in over a decade with Bill Furness, a former Eastleigh district councillor who is the vice-chairman of the neighbouring Birchington parish council.  There are more detailed profiles of the candidates at <http://www.thisiskent.co.uk/Westgate-election/story-16463752-detail/story.html>.
