6th December sees the last by-election in Cornwall before the main Cornwall Council election in May 2013.  While there are two vacant seats on the council, the Ludgvan vacancy will not be filled as councillor Irene Bailey resigned with less than six months of her term left.  So, for the final electoral test here for five months, it's time for a trip to the outskirts of Hayle.

GWINEAR-GWITHIAN AND ST ERTH, Cornwall council; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Ray Tovey at the age of 65.  A retired graphic designer and art lecturer with a passion for motorcycling, Mr Tovey had served on the now-abolished Penwith district council and had been a Cornwall cabinet member for localism and devolution until shortly before his death.

One of the more curiously-shaped electoral divisions, Gwinear-Gwithian and St Erth curves around the landward side of the Cornish town of Hayle.  The Gwinear-Gwithian parish covers the villages of Gwithian, on St Ives Bay north-east of Hayle, and Gwinear to the east of Hayle, while St Erth, the railway junction for St Ives, is located south-west of Hayle.

The only previous election result for this division is from the first election to the unitary Cornwall Council in 2009, in which Tovey rather narrowly defeated independent candidate Sheila Furneaux.  Tovey had been the Conservative district councillor for the main predecessor ward (Gwinear, Gwithian and Hayle East) since winning a by-election in October 2007, in which he resoundingly defeated independent Derek Elliott and a Labour candidate.  The other former district ward covering the present division, St Erth and St Hilary, had been Conservative since the May 2007 election in which the Conservatives defeated Furneaux in a straight fight.

This by-election has attracted a field of seven candidates, with all the three main parties, Cornish nationalists Mebyon Kernow and three Independents standing.  The Conservatives will try to defend the by-election with Lionel Pascoe, who was the other district councillor for Gwinear, Gwithian and Hayle East ward from 2006 to the abolition of Penwith district council in 2009; he is the current vice-chairman of Gwinear-Gwithian parish council and lives in the hamlet of Fraddam, part of the parish.  The 2009 runner-up Sheila Furneaux, a dental nurse from St Hilary, is standing again as an Independent.  The Liberal Democrat candidate is Yvonne Bates, who lives in Angarrack, another hamlet in Gwinear-Gwithian parish.  St Ives-based Malcolm Hurst is standing for Labour, and Mebyon Kernow are standing here for the first time in the form of John Gillingham; he gives an address in the hamlet of Bolenowe, south of Camborne.  Of the two other independent candidates, Derek Elliott is from Angarrack and stood for Cornwall council in 2009 (as the UKIP candidate in Hayle South) while Michael Roberts lives in Gwithian and has sat on Gwinear-Gwithian parish council for ten years.

The two parish councils jointly arranged a 'Meet the Candidates' event last week at the parish hall in Gwinear.  All seven candidates attended and a report is available at the Gwinear-Gwithian parish council website [http://www.ggpc.org.uk/2012/12/meet-the-candidates-event-what-happened/].

England sees five by-elections on 6th December, including a rare double by-election for two seats in the same ward.  The Liberal Democrats are defending a seat in one of their local government strongholds in London, while the Conservatives need to fend off Liberal Democrat challenges to hold marginal seats in the Essex and Oxfordshire commuter belts, but should have less trouble holding a safe ward in the Staffordshire commuter belt.  There are also by-elections in Cornwall and Wales which will be covered in the relevant blogs.

SHENFIELD, Brentwood district council, Essex; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Lionel Lee, in order to spend more time with his wife who is ill.  Lee had served for Shenfield ward since 2004 and had previously been an Essex county councillor from 1993 to 2009.

Like St Erth in Cornwall (which also has a by-election today, see the Cornish Elections blog), Shenfield is a place probably best known for its railway station.  An outer suburb of the Essex town of Brentwood on the road to Chelmsford, Shenfield is the junction station for Southend-on-Sea off the Great Eastern main line and the terminus of the Great Eastern's inner-suburban service from Liverpool Street (which will become part of Crossrail from 2018).  This gives Shenfield a ridiculously-high thirteen hourly trains to Liverpool Street, making it a perfect location for London commuters.  Shenfield's other claim to fame is that the minister of its church was once Nathanial Ward, who wrote 'The Body of Liberties', the first constitution of Massachusetts.

For much of its recent electoral history, the ward has voted like a London commuter ward as a super-safe Conservative seat; the Tory vote peaked at 77.7% in both 2007 and 2008.  However, in May this year the Conservatives surprisingly lost the ward to the Liberal Democrats on a huge swing by the large margin of 242 votes.  I don't know why this is, although there are suggestions that the Conservative group on the council may be less than united.  The local county council division (Brentwood North) was a Liberal Democrat gain from the Conservatives in 2009, although the Lib Dem strength in the county division comes from Brentwood North and Pilgrims Hatch wards which have full slates of Lib Dem district councillors.

With the Tories having to defend another seat in the same ward less than seven months later this by-election could be very interesting.  The new Conservative candidate is Steve May, about whom I have no information, while the Liberal Democrats have selected 41-year-old mother-of-two Liz Cohen.  Labour and UKIP have both selected candidates who stood in neighbouring wards in May, Richard Millwood (from Brentwood North) and David Watt (from Hutton South, who stood here in 2011) respectively.

STONECOT, Sutton London borough council, South London; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Brendan Hudson, who was Mayor of Sutton in 2009/10.  Hudson now has a politically restricted post as chair of NHS Sutton Clinical Commissioning Board.

Another of the endless residential tracts that characterise south-west London, Stonecot ward falls into two main parts.  At the north-eastern end of the ward is the area around Sutton Common Road which is part of Sutton proper, while the south-western end is more properly part of North Cheam.  In the middle is Kimpton Industrial Estate, described by the council as "one of south London's key employment areas".

Sutton council is one of the longest-running sources of Liberal Democrat strength in the UK, having been continuously run by the yellow party since 1990.  The Conservatives fought back strongly in the 2006 election but failed to take control, and the Liberal Democrats increased their majority in 2010 and got a swing in their favour at a by-election earlier this year in Worcester Park ward, which borders Stonecot ward.  Stonecot ward was typical of this description of the wider borough; while the top Conservative was only 12 votes behind the third Lib Dem candidate in 2006, that gap widened to 694 votes in the 2010 election.

This May's London Assembly elections saw the ward vote strongly for Boris, who beat Ken by 58% to 25%; in the list section the Tories also topped the poll with 39%, with Labour beating the Lib Dems into second place and a relatively high UKIP vote (9%).

The five-strong field for the by-election is headed by the Liberal Democrats' Nick Emmerson, who is described as a freelance social interviewer, whatever that means.  His main challenge will come from the Tory candidate Graham Jarvis, a self-employed journalist and PR consultant.  Labour are standing former teacher Bonnie Craven, the Greens have nominated ex-Lib Dem councillor Joan Hartfield, and the UKIP candidate is retired aeronautical engineer Jeremy Wraith.  More information on the candidates can be found at [http://www.thisislocallondon.co.uk/news/londonnews/10082928.Stonecot_byelection_candidates/].

SUNNINGWELL AND WOOTTON, Vale of White Horse district council, Oxfordshire; a rare double by-election caused by the resignation of Jane Crossley for undisclosed reasons and the disqualification of Tim Foggin who failed to attend any meetings of the council in six months.  The Conservatives will be defending both seats in this two-seat ward.

"Runs it not here, the track by Childsworth Farm,
Past the high wood, to where the elm-tree crowns
The hill behind whose ridge the sunset flames?
The signal-elm, that looks on Ilsley Downs,
The Vale, the three lone weirs, the youthful Thames?--
This winter-eve is warm,
Humid the air! leafless, yet soft as spring,
The tender purple spray on copse and briers!
And that sweet city with her dreaming spires,
She needs not June for beauty's heightening."
-Matthew Arnold, "Thyrsis"

Now here's a slice of rural/commuter England in the Oxford area.  Despite the order of the names, the largest village in this ward is Wootton, on the road from Abingdon to Eynsham about three miles north-west of Abingdon.  To the west of Wootton is the tiny parish of Besselsleigh on the Oxford-Swindon road, while the village of Sunningwell lies at the ward's eastern end.  To the north-east of Wootton can be found Boars Hill, whose views of Oxford, the Vale and the upper Thames valley inspired Matthew Arnold's poem "Thyrsis", quoted above.  That poem attracted lots of people to settle on Boars Hill; the settlers built houses with fences and walls and planted trees, which had the effect of spoiling the view for modern generations.

Abingdon and the surrounding area is another strong Liberal Democrat area, but unlike Sutton the Tories have been making serious inroads in recent years and are now clearly in the ascendency here, having gained from the Liberal Democrats the two county council divisions covering the ward in 2009, the parliamentary seat (Oxford West and Abingdon) in 2010 from shadow minister Evan Harris, and this ward's two district council seats in 2011.

On the 2011 result this ward still just about counts as a marginal, and the Liberal Democrats will hope that they can profit from the double vacancy to win at least one seat back.  The Tories can take some comfort from the fact that the by-election is a straight Tory-Lib Dem fight and there is no UKIP candidate this time.  The defending Conservatives are Adam Hardiman and Richard Treffler, both of whom live in Oxford; Hardiman is a semi-retired computer engineer who is a parish councillor and tuba player with the City of Oxford Silver Band, while Treffler works for the kitchen and electrical appliances manufacturer Miele.  The challenging Liberal Democrats, both from Boars Hill, are retired social worker Elizabeth Miles and former district councillor Valerie Shaw, who lost her seat in this ward in 2011 but still sits on Wootton parish council.

WOMBOURNE NORTH AND LOWER PENN, South Staffordshire district council; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Joan Williams at the age of 81.  A member of South Staffordshire council since 1979, she had served as the council's cabinet member for environmental services.

One of many claimants to the title of "largest village in England", Wombourne is in the long tail of the curiously-shaped South Staffordshire district, which runs along the western edge of the West Midlands metropolitan county.  Wombourne is off the A449 Wolverhampton-Kidderminster road, and is the first village encountered after leaving the Wolverhampton built-up area.  The village is close enough to the Black Country to have some industry thanks to its location on the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal; historically it was a small centre for nail-making, while today one of the major employers in Wombourne is McCain's, who have a plant here making frozen potato products.

The Wombourne North and Lower Penn ward, one of three covering the town, also takes in the much smaller village of Lower Penn to the north.

Unlike the two other commuter belt wards the Conservatives are defending this week, Wombourne politics are not seriously contested.  The Conservatives won the ward unopposed in 2007 and in 2011 the only non-Conservative candidate contesting the ward's three seats was a single UKIP candidate.

The ballot paper for this by-election has three candidates.  Barry Bond, the new Conservative candidate, fought the strongly Independent ward of Essington in the 2011 election.  His main opposition from UKIP's Lyndon Jones, the opposition candidate from 2011 who is trying again.  Both Bond and Jones live in Wombourne; the remaining candidate, Labour's John Brindle, is from Featherstone at the other end of Wolverhampton, and was runner-up in his home ward last year.

The last electoral test in Wales this year is a council by-election in a safe Labour ward in Neath.

NEATH SOUTH, Neath Port Talbot county borough council, Glamorgan; caused by the death of Labour councillor Mal Gunter.  Mr Gunter had served in local government since 1987, including a year as Mayor of Neath Port Talbot in 2008/9, and had a 37-year career at BP in Llandarcy.

One of the things Neath is rather famous for among electoral geeks is its misnamed electoral divisions.  The four wards covering the Neath community are called Cimla (pronounced Kimla), Neath North, Neath South and Neath East, which looks rather uncontentious until you look at a map and realise that Neath East is actually the furthest west of the four.  [Map: http://img443.imageshack.us/img443/861/neatheast.jpg; I think doktorb holds the copyright on that one]  Neath South is rather misnamed as well, as it contains a large part of Cimla including Cimla Hospital, being basically a residential ward going up the Cimla Road.

Neath South is a Labour ward as you would expect, with the main challenge at the last three elections coming from the Neath Port Talbot Independent Party (formerly the Residents Association) who were fairly close in 2004 but have faded badly since then.

The new Labour candidate is 28-year-old Andrew Jenkins, a Swansea University politics graduate from up the valley in Resolven, who narrowly lost out on election in Bryncoch South ward in May.  The Neath Port Talbot Independents, Plaid and the Tories are not standing after being badly burnt here in May, but the Liberal Democrats have ensured a contest by selecting another young candidate, Charlotte Cross from Cimla.
