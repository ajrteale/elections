It's all Southern England in Thursday's four by-elections.  The Lib Dems have a difficult defence in north-west London

DOLLIS HILL, Brent borough council, North London; caused by the death of Liberal Democrat councillor Dr Alec Castle.  Dr Castle, a former lecturer, was 66 years old; he had served as a Labour councillor in Brent from 1998 to 2002 and as a Liberal Democrat councillor since 2006.

A working-class tract of north-west London, Dollis Hill can be found to the south-west of the M1 terminus at Staples Corner, the ward being located south-west of the A5 and generally south-east of the A406 North Circular Road.  The ward has an interesting social makeup: the 2001 census found a White British population of just 25%, with Indians (16%) and Irish (13%) as the next-most-populous ethnic groups and about one-sixth of the population identifying themselves as black.  17% of the population gave their religion as Muslim and 15% as Hindu.  The entire ward is placed in the worse-off half of the deprivation indices.

The area is named after the Dollis Hill Estate, created in the early nineteenth century by the Finch family buying up several farms in the area and building Dollis Hill House, which in late Victorian times became the home of Lord Aberdeen and a haunt of famous people including Mark Twain and William Gladstone.  Lord Aberdeen moved out in 1897 after being appointed Governor-General of Canada, and the estate was then sold to Willesden urban district council who turned the land into Gladstone Park.  Unfortunately Dollis Hill House was demolished earlier this year after being severely damaged by fire in the 1990s.

The ward named after the estate (which confusingly does not include the Dollis Hill underground station) appears to be very politically volatile.  As recently as 2002 it was a safe Labour ward, with Labour polling 50% to 34% for the Conservatives and 9% for the Lib Dems.  Then in 2003 came along an event since which politics in the area has never been the same - the Brent East by-election which resulted in a Lib Dem gain from Labour by Sarah Teather.  At the time Dollis Hill ward was the northern end of the Brent East constituency (which was abolished in 2010).  The Lib Dems followed up in the 2006 Brent Council elections by gaining one of the three seats in the ward from Labour, and in 2010 the Lib Dems gained the other two seats to make it three out of three, although the ward remained marginal (the Lib Dem majorities were 108, 79 and 27 votes) - this at an election in which Labour regained overall control of Brent council.

This ward is still part of Sarah Teather's constituency (now Brent Central) and the by-election here will be the first post-Coalition test of the formidable Brent Lib Dem campaigning machine.  Given this and the fact that Ken Livingstone lives in the neighbouring Mapesbury ward, the 2008 GLA results are perhaps less useful here than they are in other parts of London; Ken beat Boris here by 49% to 29%, while the Conservatives narrowly beat the Lib Dems into third place (interestingly, Respect were best of the rest).

With the marginal nature of the ward much will depend on the candidates.  The defending Lib Dem candidate Alison Hopkins, described as 'local through and through' having lived in the area for 55 years, is campaigning against cuts to Brent council's library service and plans by neighbouring Barnet council to build a rubbish dump just outside the ward boundary.  For Labour, Parvez Ahmed, who owns a Bangladeshi restaurant in Kilburn, wants the speed limit reduced in residential streets.  Samer Ahmedali is the Conservative candidate; he lives in Harrow and is a manager at a Wembley supermarket.  The ballot paper is rounded off by retired college lecturer Pete Murry, standing for the Green Party.

ST BARTHOLOMEWS, Tendring district council, Essex; caused by the death of Holland-on-Sea Residents Association councillor Mary Bragg.

Another of those cases where ward and, in this case, district names are not very helpful.  The Tendring local government district is the north-eastern corner of Essex, basically everything beyond Colchester, with the seaside resort of Clacton-on-Sea and the port of Harwich being its largest towns.  St Bartholomews ward (named after a local church) covers the western part of Holland-on-Sea, an eastern suburb of Clacton.  

This ward is coastal retiree territory, with the 2001 census finding that the population of the ward had a median age of 61 (the median age of England as a whole is 37); perhaps because of this the ward is one of the better-off parts of Clacton according to the deprivation indices.  Not quite 'Frinton for the incontinent' as a famous Liverpool Street station graffito had it, but not far off either geographically or demographically.
