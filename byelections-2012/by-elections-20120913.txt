Back to normal for local by-elections this week, with the first by-election in Scotland since the full council elections in May to replace a legendary independent councillor.  There is a second Independent defence in the East Anglian town of Thetford, and Labour are defending council seats in Burnley and Loughboorugh.  But to start this week it's a trip to the Marches for the week's Conservative defence.

CHURCH STRETTON AND CRAVEN ARMS, Shropshire Council; caused by the death of Conservative councillor James Gibson.

Two of the tiny market towns in which the Marches specialise, Church Stretton and Craven Arms can both be found on the A49 Shrewsbury-Hereford road and the adjoining railway line.  However, they have rather different characters.

The first town of any size south of Shrewsbury on the A49, Church Stretton has the feeling of an inland resort, hemmed into a valley between the steep hills of Caer Caradoc to the east and the Long Mynd to the west.  In fact, it was a Victorian- and Edwardian-era resort, marketed as a Little Switzerland and a spa town.  One of the relics from that era is the Long Mynd Hotel, which dominates the view to the south of the town; during the Second World War the hotel and other buildings in the town were used by St Dunstan's, the charity for blinded service personnel which had been evacuated from Sussex.  Earlier this year the hotel was sold by the Chapman family to a national company.  The spa is still going and Princes bottled mineral water comes from here.

Once over the pass to the south of Church Stretton, the ward continues to take in four rural parishes - Wistanstow, Hopesay, Sibdon Carwood and Onibury (a landmark on the A49 thanks to its level crossing) around the town of Craven Arms, which markets itself as the Gateway to the Marches.  Craven Arms is very unlike Stretton, which is an ancient market town; Craven Arms is a railway town, named after a coaching inn on the A49 which is still in existance as the Craven Arms hotel.  There is still a railway junction here, with the single-track Heart of Wales Line (four trains a day to Swansea) branching off the Shrewsbury and Hereford line (hourly trains in each direction).  The town's railway origins means it tends to get looked down on by people from the nearby area.

The division is not safe Conservative as you might expect, with the Liberal Democrats running fairly close behind at the only previous election in 2009.  The relative dominance of Conservative and Liberal Democrat candidates last time masks some interesting patterns.  In particular, Church Stretton had a large Green Party vote; from 2003 until its abolition in 2009 the Greens held one of the two South Shropshire district council seats in Church Stretton North ward.  In 2009 the Tories and Lib Dems both put up one candidate from each town and the Craven Arms-based candidates finished top of their party; this actually points to a good Conservative performance in Stretton as their only district councillor from the town stood as an independent after failing to get the Conservative nomination (the late James Gibson had been the town's county councillor).

The three main parties are all standing candidates for the by-election.  Both the Conservatives and Lib Dems have selected high-profile candidates from Church Stretton.  Defending for the Conservatives is Lee Chapman, the same man who recently sold the Long Mynd Hotel; before 2009 he was a district councillor representing Wistanstow with Hopesay ward.  The Lib Dems' Bob Welch, who was Mayor of Church Stretton from 2007 to 2012, is trying again after coming fourth in 2009.  Labour have renominated Clive Leworthy who is chairman of Craven Arms town council.  There is no Green candidate, so it will be interesting to see where the substantial Green vote from last time goes.

TRINITY, Burnley borough council, Lancashire; caused by the death of Labour councillor Tony Lambert at the age of 72.  A former policeman, he had served as Mayor of Burnley in 2010-11.

A very deprived ward of a very deprived town, Trinity ward covers the	area immediately to the west of Burrnley town centre; a series of densely-packed terraces clinging to a hillside.  At the centre of the ward is Burnley's main railway station (Manchester Road), with Burnley Barracks station and the M65 motorway at the northern end.

Burnley was infamous for its far-right vote in the noughties, but Trinity ward has never elected anything other than Labour councillors since the last boundary review in 2002, although the ward hasn't always been safe; the Labour majority was cut to just one vote by the Lib Dems in 2010, on the day the Lib Dems gained the Burnley parliamentary seat.  The BNP also came close a few times before then, peaking in 2006 when they were just eighteen votes behind Labour.  The Liberal Democrats suffered a stonking swing against them in 2011 but recovered a bit in May, possibly helped by the absence of a Conservative candidate.

The new Labour candidate is Tony Martin, who last stood for the council in 2011 when he narrowly came last in Cliviger with Worsthorne ward.  Stephanie Forrest has been renominated for the Liberal Democrats after getting a positive swing in May.  Former BNP councillor Derek Dawson (Gannow ward) is standing under their colours.  Three other candidates are standing: in alphabetical order they are Padiham-based Craig Ramplee for UKIP, who fought Rosehill with Burnley Wood ward last year; former BNP candidate Steven Smith splitting the far-right vote as a National Front candidate; and 18-year-old sixth-form student and football referee Tom Watson for the Conservatives.

LOUGHBOROUGH SOUTHFIELDS, Charnwood district council, Leicestershire; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Graeme Smith due to pressure of work.

The Loughborough Southfields ward covers a tract of Loughborough south of the town centre.  It is named after Southfields Park and also includes Queen's Park, the Loughborough High and Grammar Schools, and part of the Loughborough University campus.

The electoral history of this ward is very boring, with the 2003, 2007 and 2011 results all being easy Labour wins about 100-200 votes ahead of the Conservatives.

Labour have gone for a veteran candidate to hold the by-election: Mary Draycott served on Leicester city council for many years, including as Lord Mayor, and now lives in Shepshed.  She is opposed by the top-polling Conservative and Lib Dem candidates from last year, Ted Parton and Diana Brass respectively.

THETFORD-ABBEY, Breckland district council, Norfolk; caused by the resignation of Independent councillor Pauline Quadling due to work commitments and poor health.

This is one of those wards with a slightly misleading name.  Thetford has a ruined priory which was once one of the most important monasteries in East Anglia, but that's on the other side of town.  The Thetford-Abbey ward covers the north-west quarter of the town of Thetford along the road to King's Lynn, including the town's railway station, and is named after the Abbey estate.  The ward continues several miles outside the town's built-up area into the Thetford Forest, following the parish boundary.

This ward has quite an interesting recent electoral history.  Labour won both seats in 2003 but lost them to Pauline Quadling and a Conservative candidate in 2007.  At the most recent election in 2003 Labour took the Conservative seat (by 20 votes) but failed to knock out Quadling who increased her majority.

With no independent candidate standing to replace Quadling, and the three main parties being separated by just 44 votes in 2011, a hard-fought by-election is in prospect.  Brenda Canham, who lost out to her running-mate by just seven votes last time and also fought the ward in 2007, is the Labour candidate.  The Conservatives have selected Roy Brame, who stood last year in Thetford-Castle ward, while the Liberal Democrats have renominated Mike Brindle.  Finally, UKIP have gone for Denis Crawford who was runner-up in the nearby Harling and Heathlands by-election in July.

CAMPSIE AND KIRKINTILLOCH NORTH, East Dunbartonshire council; caused by the death of East Dunbartonshire Independent Alliance councillor Charles Kennedy.

This is the first local by-election in Scotland since the May 2012 local elections for all local councillors in the country (the Dunoon election a week after the May elections was a postponed poll).  It comes in the Campsie Fells, the first major high ground north of Glasgow.  The Campsie and Kirkintilloch North ward runs along the southern slopes of the Campsies to the villages of Lennoxtown and Milton of Campsie, together with a small part of the town of Kirkintilloch.  The Scottish boundary commissions seem to have a vendetta against Kirkintilloch; it's split between two Westminster constituencies without being the majority part of either, and between three East Dunbartonshire wards all of which contain other areas as well.

The politics of this ward since 2007 has been dominated by Charles Kennedy, who served on East Dunbartonshire council for many years, originally as a Labour councillor (he was elected as Labour for the single-member Milton ward in 2003).  Kennedy had an enormous personal vote and polled more than half of the first preferences in 2007 and 2012, which was more than twice the quota for election under Scotland's single transferable vote system.  Kennedy could only win one seat though, and Labour and SNP hold the other two seats in the ward.  The Liberal Democrat vote in the ward completely collapsed in May, and the Conservatives were also well down.  Kennedy's surplus votes normally went to Labour over the other parties.

The council as a whole is currently run by a Labour/Lib Dem/Conservative coalition, with the SNP in opposition on the council.

The by-election will be held under the Alternative Vote, and this by-election is unpredictable enough that transfers could be crucial.  There is no East Dunbartonshire Independent Alliance candidate, but Independent candidate Brian Reid, of Lennoxtown, has agreed to sit in a group with the remaining EDIA councillor if he is elected.  The three candidates representing the administration on the council are Gemma Welsh for Labour, Alasdair Sinclair for the Conservatives (who fought Bishopbriggs South in May) and Susan Murray for the Liberal Democrats.  Campaigning can be a dangerous business sometimes: Murray found and reported a gas leak while out on the stump.  The SNP candidate is Billy Hutchison and the ballot paper is completed by 18-year-old Scottish Youth Parliament member Ross Greer, who is standing for the Scottish Greens.
