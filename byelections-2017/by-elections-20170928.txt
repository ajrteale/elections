Twelve by-elections on 28th September 2017:

<Start with tribute to Mark Senior>

Tain and Easter Ross

Highland council; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Jamie Stone, who is now MP for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross.  Stone has had a long career in politics: after a series of early jobs finishing up in the oil industry he was first elected to the now-abolished Ross and Cromarty district council, transferring to the Highland Council when it was established in 1995.  In 1999 Stone was elected to the Scottish Parliament as MSP for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross, and in 2004 captained a Scottish Parliament team which beat the Welsh Assembly on University Challenge: The Professionals.  After losing his Scottish Parliament seat to the SNP in 2011 Stone returned to the Highland council in the 2012 election, and was re-elected in May.

Last week this column went from south to north, so it's time to reverse direction by starting in the north, and they don't come much further north than Tain.  One of the major towns of Ross-shire, Tain is Scotland's oldest Royal Burgh, granted a royal charter in 1066 thanks to its status as a pilgrimage site for St Duthac.  Jamie Stone's brother Ruaridh runs one of the major local employers, the Highland Fine Cheeses factory, but Tain's major export is whisky: Glenmorangie's distillery is here.  The ward also includes a large swathe of rural Easter Ross, generally low-lying land between the Cromarty, Moray and Dornoch Firths.

At the last first-past-the-post elections in 2003 all three of the predecessor wards (Seaboard, Tain East and Tain West) returned independent councillors, and all three outgoing councillors for those wards were re-elected at the first proportional representation: however, former Seaboard councillor Richard Durham was re-elected with the Lib Dem nomination.  Independent councillor Alan Torrance then joined the SNP, but died in 2011 and the resulting by-election was won by independent candidate Fiona Robertson to restore the balance of two independents and one Lib Dem.  Durham sought re-election as an independent in 2012 but lost his seat to the new Lib Dem candidate Jamie Stone.  The 2017 election saw the SNP break through by knocking out long-serving independent councillor Alasdair Rhind who had topped the poll in 2007 and 2012; shares of the vote were 24% for the SNP, 20% for Robertson, 19% for the Lib Dems and 16% each for Rhind and the Conservatives.  Following the 2017 election the Highland Council administration is a coalition of independents, the Liberal Democrats and Labour with a secure majority (40 out of 74 seats plus this vacancy).

With that sort of fragmented result transfers and a good candidate selection are going to be crucial, but the local Lib Dems have made a nomination which on the face of it looks rather bizarre.  Their defending candidate is William Sinclair, who gives an address twenty miles to the north in Rogart, Sutherland and fought North, West and Central Sutherland ward in May - as the Labour candidate, polling 9% and finishing sixth out of eight candidates.  The SNP candidate is Stan Peace, who despite his name is a musician.  Alasdair Rhind has an opportunity to get back on the council as an independent candidate; another independent candidate is radio presenter and engineer Gerald Holdsworth.  The Conservatives have selected Eva Short, who lives in Dornoch and fought her home ward (East Sutherland and Edderton) in May.  Completing the ballot paper is another Sutherland-based candidate, Harry Christian of the Libertarian Party.

Trimdon and Thornley

Durham council; caused by the death of Labour councillor Morris Nicholls at the age of 78.  A former minor, Nicholls was the longest-serving Durham councillor, having first been elected to what was then Durham county council for the former Thornley division in 1981, and had just been re-elected in May for his tenth term of office.  He was chairman of the county council in 1997-98 and 1998-99 and served on the cabinet from 2007 to 2015 as member for adult services.  Nicholls was also a member of the former Easington district council from 1991 until its abolition in 2009, and had sat on Wheatley Hill parish council since 1983.

Our eleven English by-elections have a definite northern and eastern bias to them.  We start in County Durham in an area which will forever be politically associated with the man Labour love to hate, Tony Blair.  The MP for Sedgefield from 1983 to 2007, Blair lived in the village of Trimdon Colliery, and Trimdon Labour Club was the scene for many an election night celebration during Labour's glory days.  Lionel Jospin, then prime minister of France, came to the club in 1998 and the following year legend has it that a barmaid answered the phone and shouted across the room "Where's Tony? It's a bloke called Clinton."  Like the Labour government, Trimdon Labour club closed down in 2010 (although the building is still in use as licensed premises).  Another famous figure associated with the area is Tom Simpson, the professional cyclist who died on the ascent of Mont Ventoux during the 1967 Tour de France; Simpson was born in Haswell, a village at the northern end of the division.  A memorial to Simpson in Haswell was unveiled earlier this month by Sir Bradley Wiggins.

As the name Trimdon Colliery suggests, this is an ex-mining area on the Durham coalfield, covering a series of villages on low hills midway between Durham and Hartlepool.  The present ward was created in 2013 by merging the old Thornley division with most of the former Trimdon division, with the number of councillors cut from four to three to reflect a declining population in the area.  This is one of the areas of Britain least changed by immigration: at the 2011 census the old Trimdon division made the top 100 wards in England and Wales for population born in the UK and Thornley division was in the top 200.  Thornley in particular has high unemployment and a very working-class economic profile.

The 2013 boundary changes squeezed out the former independent councillor for Thornley, and this is a safe Labour ward.  In May this year the Labour slate polled 50% to 20% for UKIP and 19% for the Conservatives.

Defending for Labour is Jude Grant, a Thornley parish councillor; according to her Twitter, Grant is "still deciding what she wants to be when she grows up", and in the meantime is working for a local Labour MP and as a children's advicate for the National Youth Action Service.  UKIP have not nominated a candidate.  The Tory candidate is Michael Smith, who gives an address in Durham.  Also standing are Alan Bell for the Liberal Democrats, independent candidate Maurice Brown and Jonathan Elmer of the Green Party.
