Following on from <a="http://election-data.co.uk/local-elections-preview-part-i">last week's marathon description of everything up for election in England this week</a>, it's back to the usual format as we examine the four polls taking place on 4th May in Election Data's home county of Greater Manchester.  This has ended up being a rather more anaemic edition of Andrew's Previews than originally intended thanks to the cancellation of the Manchester Gorton by-election, but there's still plenty to chew over in the three local polls up for election.  But we start this week with the marquee contest...

<h2>MAYOR OF GREATER MANCHESTER</h2>

Let's go back to 1974, when the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester was created, carved out of parts of Lancashire, Cheshire and Saddleworth (then part of Yorkshire).  It had the usual two-tier structure created by the Heath local government reforms, with a Greater Manchester County Council running county-wide services and the ten metropolitan boroughs of Bolton, Bury, Manchester, Oldham, Rochdale, Salford, Stockport, Tameside, Trafford and Wigan having more local remits.

The 1983 Conservative manifesto contained a commitment to abolish the metropolitan county councils, and the Greater Manchester Council was duly abolished in 1986.  This didn't end the need for services like the fire brigade, waste disposal and public transport to be run on a county-wide basis, and the result was a series of joint boards set up by the borough councils.

The Brown government's 2009 Budget awarded a "Statutory City Region Pilot" status to Greater Manchester, with subsequent legislation allowing the ten borough councils to set up a combined authority with similar powers to the Greater London Authority.  Notable in this were increased powers on public transport, regeneration, housing, skills, planning and carbon neutrality.  This led to the creation of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority subsuming all the joint boards, which was approved by the Brown government in its dying days, confirmed by the Coalition and came into operation in April 2011.

The Coalition continued and further developed the Brown government's strategy of devolution to English cities, and the GMCA has grasped its opportunities enthusiastically: it is to take over Greater Manchester's NHS budget and some criminal justice functions, significant new powers over the county's public transport (including a long-overdue London-style bus franchising system) and has already taken over the functions of the county's Police and Crime Commissioner.  The price for this was to have an elected mayor: a single elected person to sit on the GMCA and overview all these things.  To quote from the booklet I have been sent from the Greater Manchester returning officer, "the Mayor will have various powers and responsibilities, including the fire service, transport, planning and housing and also those previously held by the Police and Crime Commissioner".

In advance of this election the outgoing PCC, Tony Lloyd, is acting as mayor on an interim basis: he is part of a 10-1 Labour majority on the GMCA which also includes the ten borough council leaders, nine of whom (Cliff Morris of Bolton, Rishi Shori of Bury, Sir Richard Leese of Manchester, Jean Stretton of Oldham, Richard Farnell of Rochdale, Salford's elected mayor Paul Dennett, Stockport's Alex Ganotis, Kieran Quinn of Tameside and Wigan's Lord Smith of Leigh) are Labour, with Trafford council leader Sean Anstee providing the only Conservative vote.  

That Labour majority is very much in keeping with Greater Manchester as a whole.  In the 2015 general election Labour polled 46% across the county to 26% for the Conservatives and 16% for UKIP.  The county has delivered big Labour leads at every county-wide poll in the last fifteen years with the exception of the 2008 local elections, in which the Tories narrowly polled the most votes, and the 2009 European election in which Labour were only narrowly ahead.  Labour had an absolute majority of votes across the county in the 2011 and 2012 local elections and also in the only previous county-wide contest for a single post, the 2012 Police and Crime Commissioner election which Lloyd won in the first round, polling 51% to 16% for the Conservatives and 15% for the Lib Dems.  Last of the five candidates in that election was UKIP MEP Steven Woolfe, who can console himself with the knowledge that he has had worse fights.

So, the indications are that this is Labour's to lose.  They have selected a strong (if Scouse) candidate in Andy Burnham, outgoing MP for Leigh; elected to Parliament in 2001 at the age of 31 after having been special advisor to Culture secretary Chris Smith, Burnham joined the ranks of government in 2005 as a junior Home Office minister, and served in Cabinet throughout the Brown administration as Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Culture secretary and finally Health secretary from 2009, initiating the inquiries into Hillsborough and the Stafford Hospital scandal.  The Labour defeat in 2010 ended Burnham's government career and he stood for the Labour leadership, coming fourth out of five candidates.  Ed Miliband kept Burnham on as shadow health secretary throughout the 2010-15 Parliament, apart from a year as shadow education secretary.  Burnham stood again for the Labour leadership in 2015, improving his placing to second but a long way behind Jeremy Corbyn; Corbyn appointed him as shadow home secretary.

Burnham resigned from the Shadow Cabinet in 2016 to concentrate on campaigning for the new Greater Manchester Mayoral post.  He defeated for the Labour nomination Tony Lloyd, the police and crime commissioner and former Manchester Central MP, and Bury South MP Ivan Lewis.  Now aged 47, in his personal life Burnham is one of the few modern MPs to have played high-level football - in July 2003 he was a substitute for Leigh RMI, then a Conference team, in a 1-1 pre-season draw against his beloved Everton.

Standing for the Conservatives is Sean Anstee, who at the age of 29 is the leader of Trafford council and the only present Conservative member of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority.  According to his election communication, he started work at 16 as an apprentice in the industrial village of Partington; he has served since 2008 as councillor for Bowdon ward, covering south-western Altrincham and a series of small villages to the west which lie within the Greater Manchester boundary.

The UKIP candidate is Shneur Odze, a rabbi from the large Jewish community in Higher Broughton and a former Conservative figure.  He served as a Hackney councillor in London before moving up north, and came close to winning Salford's Kersal ward on a few occasions in the mid-2000s; his most recent electoral outing was in 2014 when he contested Kersal ward under his new purple colours and was on the UKIP European list for north-west England.  The <em>Daily Mail</em> last week had some rather scurrilous accusations about Odze, but it would be wrong to give any credence to a source which isn't good enough for Wikipedia.  Odze did not provide an election address for the official candidate booklet.

Like the Conservatives, the Lib Dems have turned to Trafford for their candidate.  Jane Brophy, a long-serving NHS worker, has since 2008 been a councillor for Timperley ward in northern Altrincham and has clearly developed a large personal vote there, judging from the ward's recent results which show wild Tory-Lib Dem swings.  

The Green Party had to reselect following the sudden death of their original candidate Deyika Nzeribe earlier this year; their replacement is Will Patterson, who fought his home seat of Wigan at the last general election.  Two independent candidates are having a go: Mohamed Aslam, who gives an address in Salford 7, and businessman Marcus Farmer who stood in Manchester Withington in 2015 and polled sixty-one votes; and completing the ballot paper is Bury's English Democrats figure Stephen Morris, who will appear later in this column.

<h2>RUSHOLME</h2>

Manchester city council; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Kate Chappell.  She had served since 2011 and was sitting on the council's cabinet with the Environment portfolio, but had been on leave of absence from the council after recently giving birth and is resigning to concentrate on bringing up her children. 

http://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/manchester-rusholme.png

For a look at what the new Greater Manchester Mayor might be able to do to shake up things, let's take a number 42 bus south from the city centre and go for a curry.  Rusholme lies along the Wilmslow Road and the A34 a few miles south of Manchester city centre, just past the University complex.  Its demographics and politics are strongly influenced by that: as well as the Manchester Grammar School, founded in 1515 by the Bishop of Exeter Hugh Oldham and located here since 1931, the Universities fill the ward with students to the extent that <em>Fresh Meat</em>, a student-based comedy-drama which ran for four series on Channel 4 from 2011 to 2016, was set here.  Other media based in Rusholme ward included the first edition of <em>Top of the Pops</em>, broadcast on New Year's Day 1964 from a converted church on Dickenson Road.  38% of the workforce are full-time students and 43% of the population are aged between 18 and 29 - both figures being in the top 100 wards in England and Wales.  The ward is also majority non-white and 38% Muslim, with large proportions being born in Pakistan or Bangladesh, which leads to Rusholme's other main cultural reference: a riot of neon along the Wilmslow Road known as the "Curry Mile" because of the concentration of South Asian restaurants.

http://s0.geograph.org.uk/geophotos/02/12/81/2128122_471cb2f8.jpg

When the Curry Mile is not choked by traffic looking for a place to park for their curry, it's choked by buses between the city centre, the University complex and the student districts further out in Fallowfield and Withington.  This is Europe's busiest bus corridor, with over 60 buses per hour at peak times and every major and a number of minor bus companies all wanting a piece of the action; a huge proportion (by outside-London standards) of the ward's residents take the bus to work.  This, London readers, is the consequence of 31 years of that unmitigated social disaster known as bus deregulation, in which a few attractive routes get overserved and the rest of the county gets a bus every half-hour (if that) with fares so high they are scarcely believable.  A journey from your columnist's house into Bury town centre - around four miles or so each way almost entirely through a densely populated urban area - costs £4 single, £4.50 return, while the Wilmslow Road gets ten times the service frequency and lower fares to boot.  Similarly, it's not so long ago that I could take a return journey from Bolton railway station 25 miles each way to Glossop more cheaply than I could catch the bus from the station and back one-and-a-half miles each way to my then home.  And that's before I get on to integrated ticketing - there is no equivalent in Greater Manchester of the London Peak Travelcard, never mind Oyster.  This is a comprehensively broken public transport system, and the new mayor needs to sort it out pronto.  Anybody who can put coherent proposals together for integrated ticketing and London-level fares (I'll settle for London-level fares, it'll be cheaper than what I'm paying now) will certainly be considered for your columnist's vote.

Anyway, rant over and it's time to get back to Rusholme.  When the present Manchester city council was created in 1974 Rusholme was a safe Conservative ward with one of its councillors being Dame Kathleen Ollerenshaw, a noted mathematician who in 1978-79 served simultaneously as High Sheriff of Greater Manchester and President of the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications; despite being profoundly deaf she was heavily involved in the merger which formed the Royal Northern College of Music, and Sir Peter Maxwell Davis dedicated his Naxos Quartet No 9 to her.  By this time demographic changes were starting to make their mark on Rusholme: Labour gained the ward for the first time in 1979 and by the 1982 election - held on new boundaries, it was a safe Labour ward.  In the mid-1980s the Alliance took over second place, and they gained a seat in the ward in 1987 but Labour took it back in 1991, and despite a couple of close contests and the intervention of a Labour splinter group in the interim it was not until 2000 that the Liberal Democrats got back in front in Rusholme.  The Lib Dems gained a second seat in 2003 and the final Labour seat in 2004, when the ward took on its current boundaries; but Labour got back in 2010 on the general election turnout and after that the advent of the coalition and the collapse of the Lib Dem student vote led to annihilation for the Lib Dems here.  The most recent election in Rusholme, in May 2016, had Labour polling 75% with the Greens a very distant second.

This ward is in the Manchester Gorton constituency, and it will be interesting to see what effect the campaigning for the aborted parliamentary by-election will have had.  Respect had good third places in Rusholme in the 2006 and 2007 elections, and had the Gorton by-election gone ahead it would have been instructive to see how much of that Gallowayite vote would have translated into votes for George Galloway this time round; additionally, the Lib Dems had been talking up their chances of a good performance.

We wait to see, and in any event Labour's candidate would have to be a very heavy favourite: she is Jill Lovecy who, like Ollerenshaw, is a former Manchester University lecturer (in politics, in this case).  Lovecy is opposed by Anne Tucker for the Greens, Amaan Hashmi for the Lib Dems, David Semple for the Conservatives and Jack Metcalf for the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition.

<h2>BROADHEATH</h2>

Trafford council; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Louise Dagnall on health grounds.  She had served since 2014.

http://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/trafford-broadheath.png

Our other two by-elections in Greater Manchester on 4th May are outside the M60 motorway, and we start with the southern one in a key marginal ward.  Broadheath is the north-western of the seven wards covering the town of Altringham: this is a residential and industrial area along the A56 Manchester Road and north-west of the Bridgwater Canal, together with the area around Deansgate Lane and a small part of Sale.  Timperley tram stop lies on the ward's eastern boundary.  Greater Manchester residents of a certain age may recall trying to keep their balance on the Altrincham Ice Rink, which was located within this ward.

Broadheath ward has high full-time employment levels and a middle-class economic profile, but the presence of a largish industrial area means that this is Labour's best of the seven wards in Altrincham, and since the formation of the Coalition the ward has turned from a safe Tory area into a key marginal.  The Tories held the seat in 2011 by 122 votes, but Labour gained all three seats between 2012 and 2014 by narrow majorities thanks to a by-election gain in January 2014.  The Tories reversed that by-election gain on the general election turnout in 2015 - their candidate then was Stephen Anstee, identical twin brother of Sean - but Labour held their majority in the ward in 2016 by defeating the Conservatives 47-41.  Broadheath might not be in a key marginal constituency (Altrincham and Sale West is safe for the Conservatives) but Trafford is one of only two metropolitan boroughs under Conservative overall control (with 34 out of 62 seats) and a Tory gain here would give their majority extra breathing space going into the next borough elections in 2018.

Defending for Labour is Amy Whyte, a teaching assistant who gives an address in the Sale part of the ward.  Also living within the ward is the Conservative candidate Dave Morgan, a chartered accountant.  The ballot paper is completed by Simon Latham for the Lib Dems, Joe Ryan for the Green Party, independent candidate Stephen Farndon and UKIP's Mike Bayley-Sanderson.

<h2>BESSES</h2>

Bury council; caused by the resignation on health grounds of Labour councillor Alan Matthews, who had served since 1979.  He was Bury's longest-serving councillor and was Mayor of Bury in 1989-90.

http://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/bury-besses.png

"I thought Whitefield was quite nice", said a friend on your columnist's Facebook this week referencing a recent stabbing at a local surgery.  Well, not all of it.  In fact Whitefield, a northern suburb of Manchester just outside the M60 motorway on the road and tram line to Bury, is quite starkly socially divided.  The western of Whitefield's two wards, Pilkington Park, is strongly Jewish and middle-class, whle Besses ward, lying generally to the east of Bury New Road, is based on the Hillock, Elms and Victoria council estates around Thatch Leach Lane, Ribble Drive and Mersey Drive.  Hillock in particular is a Manchester overspill estate and generally seen to be one of the must successful of its kind.  Thatch Leach Lane, on the other hand, hasn't recovered from the mid-1990s proposal to flatten the area for the construction of a <a href="http://pathetic.org.uk/unbuilt/m62_relief_road/">new motorway</a> to relieve what's now the M60.  The ward has some manufacturing particularly along Stanley Road, original home of Halls cough sweets; also on Stanley Road was the UK's first branch of the DIY chain Wickes.  Despite this, the name of Besses is still probably best known for Besses o' th' Barn brass band, who may no longer be in the top rank of banding but undertook two succesful world tours in the 1900s, and are seen here playing the march "Around the World" specially written for those tours.

This all adds up to a safe Labour ward where the party led the Tories 59-20 at the most recent election in 2016.  However, there is a relatively large radical right vote based around the English Democrats' Stephen Morris, who lives in this ward and has contested it at every election since 2008, regularly polling 13-16% outside general election years and finishing in second place in 2012; his vote in 2016 at 12% was relatively low.  Besses ward has a relatively large Jewish population (3.3%) and with recent polls putting the Tories within range of gaining the strongly-Jewish Bury South constituency, this is still worth watching.

The defending Labour candidate Andrea Simpson, an NHS worker, has bitter experience of what effect Labour's perceived anti-Semitism problem can have on the electorate: she was the councillor who lost her seat in one of the most emblematic results from the 2016 local elections, in which the Conservatives won Sedgley ward in Prestwich for the first time since 1992.  This should be a safer berth for her.  The Tories have selected Satyen Sinha, who lives on the Hillock estate and runs a marketing and communications company.  Also standing are Stephen Morris for the English Democrats, doubling up at both mayoral and council level, Janneke Calle for the Greens and Gavin Warnes for the Lib Dems.
