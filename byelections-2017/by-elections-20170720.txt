Nine by-elections on Thursday 20th July 2017:

ALSTON MOOR

Eden council, Cumbria; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Thomas Sheriff after less than a year in office.  He was elected for the ward in a by-election in August 2016.

When reading something, it's traditional to start at the top, and Alston Moor certainly counts as the top: it's one of the highest wards in England.  Alston itself vies with Buxton for the title of England's highest market town, lying in the valley of the South Tyne over 1,000 feet above sea level.  The town's economy was traditionally based on mining: there are large deposits of lead, silver and coal in the area.  The nearby village of Nenthead, at over 1,500 feet, dates only from the mid-eighteenth century: built by the London Lead Company to serve the Nenthead mines, it was the UK's first village to have electric street lighting.  Tynehead, once another thriving mining village but now reduced to a single house, was once the location of England's highest primary school, while Garrigill lies on the Pennine Way at the end of the descent from its highest point, Cross Fell.  With the end of mining in the area (although there are thought to be significant zinc deposits below Nenthead) the population of Alston Moor parish, which includes the town, all those villages and a large amount of moorland and was a Rural District of its own until 1974, has crashed from over 6,800 in 1831 to around 2,100 today, and Alston's Wikipedia page paints a picture of a town in serious decline: its last bank closed in 2015 and Channel 4 were in town in 2006 with a documentary examining a serious male : female imbalance in the local population.  When Eden's ward boundaries were last reviewed in 1997 Alston Moor was very lucky to get away with unchanged boundaries given that its electorate was then 20% below quota.  Tourism, farming and metalworking are now the main local employers; self-employment rates in the ward are high and there is a relatively old age profile.

Despite its location in South Tynedale, Alston is included within Eden district council which is based in Penrith and covers a large and very sparsely populated swathe of eastern Cumbria.  Eden council is traditionally dominated by independent councillors, but Alston has had some very strange election results over the last year.  The Conservatives have one of the ward's two seats since 2011, but in 2016 the Conservative councillor David Hymers, who held the economic development portfolio on Eden council, resigned after his business affairs were featured in the Rotten Boroughs column of Private Eye.  Suffice it to say that it wasn't exactly flattering coverage.  The resulting by-election n August 2016 saw the Tories being beaten 55-45 by the Lib Dems in a straight fight, but the Lib Dem councillor has since resigned to cause this by-election.  The strangeness continued with the county elections in May, in which the ward's independent county councillor Mary Robinson was unexpectedly defeated by Labour who have no track record in the local county division (Alston and East Fellside).

So anything could happen here, but one thing is guaranteed: there will be a gain because there is no defending Liberal Democrat candidate and the seat is up for grabs.  Taking the four candidates in ballot paper order, the Conservatives have selected Jim Clapp from Garrigill, who is the parish's vet and therefore had a high profile during the 2001 foot-and-mouth crisis which hit Cumbria hard.  There is one independent candidate, Lai Heung "Holly" Ho who is an Alston Moor parish councillor.  The Green Party have selected their local party secretary Richard O'Brien, who fought Kirkby Stephen in the coutny elections in May, and the Labour candidate is youth worker Lissie Sharp.

BILLINGHAM NORTH

Stockton-on-Tees council, County Durham; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Stephen Parry.  Parry resigned shortly before the general election in opposition to Jeremy Corbyn.

http://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/stockton-billingham-n.png

We seem to having a glut of by-elections n the Tees Valley conurbation at the moment, with two in Middlesbrough and one in Yarm since the general election.  This time we move to the Durham bank of the Tees and to a collection of housing estates on the northern edge of Billingham off Marsh House Avenue which have mostly gone up since the 1970s.  Billingham is one of the UK's most important centres for chemicals: ICI Billingham and associated companies (like the Nobel dynamite works and Tioxide, where your columnist's father once worked) was one of the North East's most important employers back in the day, and paid well enough that most of its employees ran two cars.  (They needed to: the staff car park was placed directly under the fallout from the chimneys, so anything parked there on a regular basis would turn into a rustbucket within months.)  The business rates paid by ICI meant that the old Billingham Urban District Council was able to afford amenities such as a shopping centre and theatre (the Billingham Forum) much earlier and to a higher standard than towns of a comparable size.  Chemicals are still important to Billingham's economy, and this ward is less than a mile away from the fast-growing Wynyard Business Park on the far side of the A19 which is described as one of the North East's most prestigious business addresses.  It's not surprising that Billingham North ward is within the top 60 wards in England and Wales for population educated to Apprenticeship level (7.3% of the workforce) or that employment levels within the ward are high.

Interestingly this is not a safe Labour ward and never has been.  Billingham North (and its predecessor on the 1979-2005 boundaries, Marsh House ward) has generally been a close Labour versus Lib Dem fight since the Alliance gained a seat in the ward in 1987.  Boundary changes in 2005, as well as cutting out the village of Wolviston and renaming the resulting ward Billingham North, granted an extra councillor to the ward.  The Lib Dem councillors for Billingham North left the party in 2010 over the creation of the Coalition and rebadged themselves as the Billingham Independents Association, under which label they have not been quite as successful: Labour gained a seat in the ward in the 2011 election, and rode the general election turnout to a full slate of three seats in 2015.  Shares of the vote that year were 35% for Labour, 24% for the Independents, 21% for UKIP and 20% for the Conservatives.

Without a general election turnout it's not a guarantee that Labour can hold this if the independents get their act together.  The defending Labour candidate is Paul Weston who works in the housing sector.  The independent candidate is Jennifer Apedaile, Lib Dem and then independent councillor for Marsh House ward 2003-05 and Billingham North ward 2005-15.  There is no UKIP candidate.  Standing for the Tories is Sam Linley, who according to his Twitter is a second-year physics student at the University of York.  Completing the ballot paper are Mark Burdon for the North East Party and official Liberal Democrat candidate David Minchella.

ST MICHAELS

Knowsley council, Merseyside; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Vickie Lamb.  She had served since winning a by-election in April 2013.

http://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/knowsley-st-michaels.png

The two Northern by-elections above may look like a certain gain and a likely gain, but only the most deluded gambler would bet against a Labour hold in this week's Merseyide by-election.  We're in St Michaels ward, post-war suburbia on the eastern edge of Huyton along the Liverpool Road and Huyton Lane.

Huyton will forever be politically associated with Harold Wilson, who wherever he is now is presumably looking down on Huyton (or up at it, depending on your political tastes) and tut-tutting at the Knowsley branch of Labour for letting one-party representation on Knowsley council slip in 2016.  That was in connection with a boundary review which cut the size of Knowsley council from 63 councillors to 45; while St Michaels ward survived in name it has very different boundaries from the 2004-16 St Michaels ward where Labour were perfectly capable of exceeding 90% in a good year.  The only previous result on these boundaries is from 2016 when Labour, who were guaranteed a seat in the ward due to insufficient opposition candidates, beat UKIP 74-17.

Defending for Labour is Mike Kearns, who has had a distinctly chequered career on Knowsley council thus far: he was councillor for Longview ward from 1994 to 2008 when he was deselected following a drink-driving conviction.  Kearns returned to Knowsley council in 2012 by gaining Prescot West ward from the Liberal Democrats, but lost his seat in that ward back to the Lib Dems in 2016.  There is no UKIP candidate this time so Kearns is opposed by Dean Boyle of the Lib Dems and Kirk Sandringham of the Green Party.

CHIDDINGLY AND EAST HOATHLY

Wealden council, East Sussex; caused by the disqualification of Conservative councillor Barby Dashwood-Morris, who failed to attend any council meetings in six months.  Originally elected in 2007 as Barby Dashwood-Hall, in May she was fined £75,000 for making changes to the interior of her home, the Grade II-listed Priest House in Hellingly, without having obtained planning permission - all this while serving as chair of Wealden council's planning committee.

http://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/wealden-chiddingly-e-hoathly.png

For our first by-election of the week in the South outside London, we are a particularly rural ward of East Sussex covering a series of villages off the A22 Eastbourne-Uckfield road.  Despite the order of the names, the largest village within the ward is East Hoathly, about 15 miles north of Eastbourne, while Chiddingly is a more historic village which goes on the rapidly-growing list of locations built upon seven hills (see also Sheffield, Edinburgh etc.).  The area was a centre of the Weald iron industry in days gone, but is now a rural area with high self-employment levels and a relatively old age profile.

Dashwood-Morris had a safe seat: at her last re-election in 2015 she beat Labour 65-19.  The local county council seat (Arlington, East Hoathly and Hellingly) is almost as safe, and that majority is surely scandal-proof.

Defending for the Conservatives is David Watts, a town councillor in Polegate some distance to the south of the ward who was Mayor of Polegate in 2016-17.  Labour have selected Tony Fielding who fought the local county seat in May, and the ballot paper is completed by Lib Dem candidate Paul Holbrook.

NEW ROMNEY

Shepway council, Kent; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Peter Simmons.  He had served since 2011, serving for New Romney Coast ward until 2015 and New Romney ward since then; in late 2015 he had resigned from the Shepway council Conservative group over inappropriate expenses claims, but was subsequently readmitted after repaying some money to the council.

http://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/shepway-new-romney.png

The weather has always been, and probably always will be, a hot topic of conversation in Britain, and for decades now climate change has been the hot political topic of the day.  But the weather which hit the southern North Sea for three consecutive winters in the 1280s was so truly terrible it changed the course of geography and arguably history.  First in January 1286 came a storm surge which hugely damaged the great East Anglian port of Dunwich; last in December 1287 was St Lucia's flood, a storm surge which killed tens of thousands of people in what is now the Netherlands and northern Germany and created the Zuiderzee.  In between was the southern England flood of February 1287, which was so violent it led to a wholesale redrawing of the coastline in what is now Kent and East Sussex.  The city of Winchelsea and the port of Broomhill were completely destroyed, and the Cinque Port of New Romney, an important Channel port located at the mouth of the River Rother, almost cinq beneath mud, sand and other debris which was never completely cleared - pre-storm buildings, such as the town's Norman church, are still accessed by steps down from street level.  When the rain had stopped falling and the water had receded, the River Rother was gone - its course diverted to Rye - and the sea was more than a mile away, where it remains today.  That was the end of New Romney as a port, although its survival was assured as the main town serving the isolated and sparsely populated farming area called Romney Marsh.  It says something for how isolated New Romney is that one of its major links to the outside world is the miniature Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch railway, and that's reflected in its population profile: the old Coast ward in particular has a high retired population.

Not even the Local Government Boundary Commission can redraw the map as radically as the 1280s storms, although they had a go in advance of the 2015 election in which Shepway district got a new and very different ward map.  New Romney had previously been two wards: New Romney Coast, covering the villages of Greatstone and Littlestone - named after former navigation markers in the Rother estuary - was Conservative in 2003, Lib Dem in 2007 and Conservative in 2011, while New Romney Town split its two seats Tory/Labour in 2003 but had been Conservative since then.  The Boundary Commission merged Coast and Town wards into a single New Romney ward which at its only previous election, in 2015, split its two seats between the Conservatives and UKIP whose slates polled 29% each to 16% for independent candidate William Wimble - outgoing Conservative councillor for New Romney Town ward who had been deselected - and 11% for Labour.  However, it wasn't all good news for UKIP as on the same day they lost a Kent county council by-election in the local division (Romney Marsh) which they were defending from the Conservatives, and the Tories consolidated their position in May's county elections.

Defending for the Conservatives is Russell Tillson, who was their unsuccessful candidate here in 2015 and had served for eight years before then as councillor for the former Dymchurch and St Mary's Bay ward.  Surprisingly UKIP have not nominated a candidate, but former councillor Wimble, standing under his middle name of David, is trying again as an independent - he is now editor of a local newspaper, <em>The Looker</em>, and was third just behind UKIP in May's county elections here.  The Labour candidate is company director John Cramp, and the ballot paper is completed by former councillor Val Loseby (New Romney Coast ward, 2007-11) for the Liberal Democrats.
