Seven local by-elections on 9th March 2017:

<hr>

<h2>DERWENT</h2>
Derby city council; caused by the death of UK Independence Party councillor Bill Wright.  A resident of Derwent ward for 50 years, Wright had served since 2014; two months before his death on Christmas Eve it was reported that he had applied to defect to Labour, but then changed his mind.

To start the week we are in the city of Derby.  Derwent ward is rather misnamed as it contains none of the river it is named after; instead it lies in the north-east of Derby, east of the Midland railway line and north-east of the Pentagon roundabout, a notoriously congested road junction next to the Derbyshire county cricket ground.  Much of the ward is made up of inter-war council housing, and that history has fed through into the ward's modern demographic; it's a working-class area with high unemployment.

For most of the 21st century Derwent has been safe Labour, although the Tories got within seven points of Labour in 2003 (when the defending Labour candidate had an Asian name) and within ten points in 2008.  During this time Bill Wright polled some good scores as an independent candidate - 13% in 2006 and 2007 (beating the Lib Dems), 14% in 2008.  At the time Wright was a director of the Revive Centre, which had brought multiple health services  in the area under one roof.  The results in the early part of this decade demonstrated a radical right-wing vote in the ward, with the BNP polling 12% in 2010, 13% in 2011 (Beating the Lib Dems) and 12% in 2012 (beating the Conservatives).

Since 2012 Derwent ward's election results have gone haywire.  In 2014 Bill Wright returned to the ballot paper as the UKIP candidate and won a close three-way marginal with just 32% of the vote, beating Labour by 37 votes and the Lib Dem candidate Richard Hudson by 217.  Although the general election turnout in 2015 enabled Labour to hold, the 2016 election returned another three-way marginal result, with Labour losing their seat by just three votes - to Richard Hudson, now standing for the Conservatives; the Tories and Labour polled 33% each to 27% for UKIP.

With UKIP polling rather more poorly than they would have liked in recent by-elections in industrial areas north of the Trent (notably in Stoke Central two weeks ago), Labour in a similar pickle and the Conservatives having won the most recent contest, this is a fascinatingly unpredictable seat in which all three of the above parties will feel they have a chance of winning.  A Labour gain will give the party some breathing space on Derby city council, where they had a majority of one seat before Wright's death (26 Labour councillors to 17 Conservatives, five Lib Dems and three UKIPpers).

Defending for UKIP is Tony Crawley, who contesting the neighbouring Chaddesden ward in 2016.  The Labour candidate is Nadine Peatfield, founder of the Lots for Tots magazine for parents of children under the age of five.  The Conservatives have selected Steve Willoughby, who works locally for Rolls-Royce, and the ballot paper is completed by Simon Ferrigno for the Lib Dems.

<h2>EXTON</h2>
Rutland council; caused by the resignation of the leader of Rutland council Terry King on health grounds; he suffered a stroke in December.  He had served since 2003.

Staying in the East Midlands, we come to the first of the week's rural wards.  Exton is a large and rather diffuse area in the centre of England's smallest county, which on 1st April celebrates the 20th anniversary of Rexit as it declared independence from Leicestershire.  Exton itself is the largest village in the ward, a village of country seats with the Earls of Gainsborough having their home at Exton Hall, which is still in the hands of the Noel family.  Not that the grounds of Exton Hall are all green and pristine; the associated park lay on a large ironstone deposit which was extracted between the 1950s and 1970s by Sundew, at the time of its construction the world's largest dragline excavator.  To the south of the ward is most of Rutland Water, one of Europe's largest artificial lakes and England's largest reservoir by surface area.  In the north-west of the ward is one of Terry King's achievements as leader of the council: Oakham Enterprise Park, formerly HMP Ashwell which closed in 2011 after badly damaged in a 2009 riot, and before then a US Army base during the Second World War.

King had won four consecutive elections in Exton with large majorities.  He was unopposed at his first election in 2003; at his last re-election in 2015 he had 53% of the vote to 19% for the Lib Dems and 15% for UKIP.  The Tories have a large majority on Rutland council (19 seats, including this vacancy, to six independents and two Lib Dems).

Defending for the Conservatives is June Fox, a businesswoman who gives an address in Whitwell, one of the smaller villages in the ward.  The Lib Dem candidate is Joanna Burrows, an Oakham resident who is described as a keen supporter of local charities.  Completing the ballot paper is UKIP's Claire Barks, who fought this ward in 2015.

RED HORSE
Stratford-on-Avon council, Warwickshire; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Bart Dalla Mura.  A former chief executive of the poultry firm Bernard Matthews, he had served since 2015.

Moving west from Rutland, we are on the Warwickshire/Oxfordshire border to pay tribute to one of the most significant days in English history - Sunday 23 October 1642, upon which day the Parliamentarian and Royalist armies met at Edgehill in the first pitched battle of the English Civil War.  Before then the escarpment of Edgehill was home to a hill figure of a horse cut into the hill's red clay, which had disappeared by the start of the twentieth century but still gives its name to the valley below.

The present Red Horse ward was created in 2015 from ten parishes previously contained in two wards, Burton Dassett and Vale of the Red Horse.  These are small parishes: Tysoe, covering three villages below Edge Hill, is the largest with 942 electors, while neighbouring Compton Wynyates having only 16 electors.  The two predecessor wards had a commuter economic profile thanks to their proximity to Banbury, just over the county boundary, and were both safe Conservative; the only previous result on these boundaries in 2015 went to the same form with the Tories beating UKIP 62-15.  The picture is a little more nuanced at Warwickshire county council level, with the ward split between two divisions one of which (Kineton) was close between the Conservatives and UKIP in 2013.  However, this by-election won't affect control of the district council where the Tories have a large majority (30 seats including this and another pending vacancy, to four Lib Dems, one Labour and an independent).

Defending for the Conservatives is John Feilding - that is not a misprint - who is chair of Radway parish council within the ward.  The UKIP candidate is Edward Fila, a headhunter for the motor industry who is chairman of the party's Stratford-on-Avon branch and fought that constituency and this ward in 2015; he lives within the ward in Oxhill.  Also standing are Philip Vial for the Lib Dems and Pat Hotson for the Green Party.

Parliamentary constituency: Kenilworth and Southam (part: Compton Wynyates, Oxhill, Tysoe and Whatcote parishes), Stratford-on-Avon (part: Avon Dassett, Farnborough, Radway, Ratley and Upton, and Warmington parishes)
Warwickshire county council divsion: Kineton (part in Stratford-on-Avon constituency), Stour and the Vale (part in Kenilworth and Southam constituency)

HAILEY, MINSTER LOVELL AND LEAFIELD
West Oxfordshire council; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Warwick Robinson at the age of 70.  He was first elected in 2000 for Minster Lovell ward, transferring to this ward in 2002 following boundary changes, and served for eight years on the West Oxfordshire cabinet.  In his working life he had travelled the world in the jeans industry before becoming a part-time second-hand-car salesman.

Moving over the county boundary into Oxfordshire, we come to another village-based ward covering five parishes just to the north of the town of Witney.  Leafield, once the highest point of Oxfordshire until the Vale of White Horse was transferred into the county, was once home to a Post Office radio transmission station which has since served as a headquarters for several short-lived Formula 1 teams (Arrows, Super Aguri, most recently Caterham).  Minster Lovell has an interesting connection with democracy: much of the village was developed in the 1840s by the Chartist movement, and is still known today as the Charterville Allotments.  Minster Lovell and Hailey both lie on the lower reaches of the River Windrush, while much of the rural parts of the ward once lay within the royal forest of Wychwood.

Robinson died in September, so this by-election has taken an unusually long time to call.  This may or not be connected to the fact that Hailey, Minster Lovell and Leafield ward suddenly became marginal in 2016 with a strong independent candidacy from Graham Knaggs, who cut the Tory majority to 38-33 (with 13% for the Lib Dems).  Before that the ward had been very safe Conservative, and was uncontested in 2008.  The Conservatives safely hold the local county division (Hanborough and Minster Lovell) and their overall control of the council is not at issue here: they have 41 seats including this vacancy to four Labour and four Lib Dems.

Defending for the Conservatives is Brendan Kay, an estate agent and former Army officer.  Knaggs is not standing again.  The Lib Dem candidate is Kieran Mullins, and the ballot paper is completed by the wonderfully-named Calvert McGibbon for Labour, Andrew Wright for the Greens and Jim Stanley for UKIP.

HERTFORD CASTLE
East Hertfordshire council; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Kevin Brush.

For our two by-elections this week in Hertfordshire we go straight to the heart of the county.  We're in Hertford itself, one of England's more obscure county towns with a population of only 27,000.  It is first known to history in AD 673 as the location for the first synod of English bishops, with the date of Easter being one of the items on the agenda; the modern town begins in Norman times with the building of Hertford Castle and the founding of Hertford Priory.  The castle was a royal residence for many years until the end of the Tudor dynasty, and Parliament met there in 1563 to escape a plague outbreak in London.  After the royal family ceased to use the castle it was granted to the Earls of Salisbury, and the Tudor gatehouse - the only part of it which remains today - was briefly used as the head office of the East India Company before becoming the offices of Hertford Corporation and their successors, Hertford town council.  In the meantime the town prospered as a typical rural market town with good communications to London, thanks to the completion of the Lea Navigation in 1767 and the coming of the railway in 1843.

The ward named after Hertford Castle ward contains much of the town centre - which still retains its mediaeval layout and is thus chronically congested - together with a small rural hinterland to the south.  Its modern economy is based on administration, with Hertfordshire county council and East Hertfordshire district council both being based in the ward, and commuting to London, with both of Hertford's railway stations being located here.  Not surprisingly the ward has a demographic to match: 43% of the workforce are educated to degree level and over 50% are in management-level occupations, with full-time employment being high.

Hertford Castle ward is Conservative at local level, but was not always safely so in the Noughties and the Tories did lose the ward to an independent candidate in a by-election in May 2013.  The 2015 election restored the full Tory slate, the Tories polling 41% to 22% for the outgoing independent councillor and 20% for the Labour slate.  The ward presently forms part of a safe Conservative county council division (St Andrew's) and there are no implications for control of the council as the Tories presently hold all but one of the council seats (the one that got away being independent).

Defending for the Tories is Linda Radford, a retired pharmacist and mathematician who is in her second consecutive term as Mayor of Hertford and is the widow of former ward councillor Russell Radford.  There is no independent candidate this time.  The Labour candidate is Veronica Fraser, and the ballot paper is completed by Tony Tarrega for the Green Party, UKIP's Mike Shaw and the Lib Dems' Freya Waterhouse.
