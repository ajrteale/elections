"All the right votes, but not necessarily in the right order"

Just a week to go now until the 2017 ordinary local government elections, which at the time I started writing this were the big electoral test of the year but now serve only as a warmup for the general election on 8th June.  All the by-elections in advance of May are now finished: there were none on 27th April but on 4th May there are no fewer than one hundred and seven casual vacancies up for election.  No, I am not going to preview 107 local by-elections in the amount of detail readers have grown accustomed to: I have a full-time job (for the moment; reasonable offers of employment after November will be considered) and simply don't have the time to do that sort of research.  Instead, forming the first part of a two-part preview, here is a (relatively) short rundown of all the vacancies up for election on 4th May.  Read on...

<hr>

<h2>NORTH EAST</h2>

We start, as most government statistics of this type do, in north-east England.  The north-east has had an entirely unitary local government structure since the abolition of the Durham and Northumberland district councils in 2009.

The unitary <em>Northumberland</em> council is up for election in its entirety.  This is a hung council, with Labour presently two seats short of a majority and running a minority administration.  The Labour seats are concentrated in the densely-populated south-east of the county, with the Tories and Lib Dems splitting the rest, and Labour pretty much maxed out their seats in 2013; there are only two division which Labour can gain on a swing of less than 5%.  Another hung council looks on the cards here.

The only poll this year in <em>Tyne and Wear</em> is for the <b>North Tyneside</b> mayoralty.  This is traditionally a see-saw contest with no mayor having been re-elected since the position was instituted in 2002.  Labour mayor Norma Redfearn is seeking re-election and is challenged by Stewart Hay for the Conservatives, a solicitor and former police officer who stood for Northumbria police and crime commissioner in 2016; the Lib Dems' John Appleby and UKIP's Stuart Houghton complete the ballot paper.

The unitary <em>Durham</em> council is up for election.  This has a large Labour majority at present (96 out of 126 seats) which looks in little danger.  The only significant Tory vote in the county comes from the deeply rural Teesdale area; Labour's main opposition comes from independents of various stripes, while the Lib Dems wil be looking for gains in the city of Durham itself.

Darlington and the four councils covering the Teesside area will combine to poll for the <em>Tees Valley</em> combined authority.  The <b>Tees Valley</b> mayoralty should be an easy win for Labour's Sue Jeffrey, the leader of Redcar and Cleveland council, although the party has performed poorly in by-elections in Redcar and Middlesbrough over the last two months, losing the outlying Middlesbrough estate of Coulby Newham to the Conservatives three weeks ago.  That win will give some encouragement to the Tory candidate Ben Houchen, who leads the Tory group on Stockton council.  The Lib Dems' Chris Foote-Wood, a long-standing activist who led the former Wear Valley district council for six years and was Victoria Wood's brother, and UKIP's John Tennant, who leads the party's group on Hartlepool council, complete the mayoral ballot paper.  For UKIP this contest probably plays second fiddle to an important local by-election in Hartlepool, their top target in the North East where they will try to gain the <b>Headland and Harbour</b> ward from Labour - this ward was a UKIP gain in the 2016 ordinary elections and in a by-election shortly afterwards, and this poll is an opportunity for the Kippers to gain all three of the ward's seats within a year.  Mike McLaughlin defends for Labour, Tom Cassidy will try to gain for UKIP.

<h2>NORTH WEST</h2>

Moving over the Pennines we come to our first two-tier area.  <em>Cumbria</em> county council is under no overall control with the administration being a coalition of Labour and the Lib Dems.  The general pattern is that Labour being the largest party thanks to their strength in Carlisle, the West Cumbria coalfield and Barrow, the Lib Dems doing well in Tim Farron's constituency and the Conservatives pick up most of the rest; it will be interesting to see whether the recent Copeland by-election gain and the Corbyn leadership can change that (particularly in Barrow-in-Furness).  Fans of the <em>7 Up</em> TV series may wish to note that Neil Hughes - one of the <em>7 Up</em> children - is seeking re-election for the Lib Dems in the Eden Lakes division, a large area stretching from Ullswater to Shap and Tebay.  In local by-elections Labour defend <b>Belle Vue</b> and <b>Yewdale</b> wards, two neighbouring wards on the western edge of Carlisle: Belle Vue looks safe enough for Pamela Birks but Yewdale is a key marginal, with David Graham looking to defend a 2.3% lead over the Tories' Christina Finlayson.  The Lib Dems have a safe local by-election to defend in the tourist central <b>Ambleside and Grasmere</b> ward, which should return Vicky Hughes to South Lakeland council.

Moving over the sands into <em>Lancashire</em> we have a key contest for the county council which is finely balanced between the Conservatives and Labour.  Labour are presently the largest party, four seats ahead of the Tories but four seats short of a majority, and are running a minority administration with Lib Dem support.  Boundary changes here make it difficult to make a firm prediction.  Four by-elections are combined with the county elections, two of them in Preston: <b>Ashton</b> ward, in the west of town overlooking the docks, was Tory in the pit of the last Labour government but should be safe enough for Labour's Liz Atkins - a former councillor for the ward and wife of the former Labour MP Ron Atkins, who will turn 100 this year - while <b>Preston Rural East</b> ward, covering three parishes to the north and east of Preston, is rock-solid for the Tories' Ron Woollam.  To the west of Preston, Fylde council has a by-election for the aerospace-influenced <b>Warton and Westby</b> ward in which the Tories' John Kirkham will defend against a challenge from independent Dan Docherty; while further north in Thornton-Cleveleys Labour have a difficult defence in the split <b>Bourne</b> ward of Wyre council.  Joanne Cooper defends Bourne for Labour with Emma Ellison challenging for the Conservatives.  Outside the county council area we have a poll in the volatile <b>Marsh House</b> ward in south-eastern Darwen, which in the last ten years has voted for all three main parties and a localist "For Darwen" slate, and was a Tory gain from Labour last year by a margin of just two votes; Labour's Kieran Richards is defending the party's last seat in the ward from the Tories' Lynn Perkins.  One further poll in Lancashire on 4th May is a referendum on whether to introduce an elected mayoralty in <b>Burrnley</b>.

The marquee contest in <em>Merseyside</em> is for the <b>Liverpool City Region</b> mayor - this is a different office from the Liverpool City Council mayor which is different again from the Lord Mayor of Liverpool.  Please don't get confused.  The City Region mayoralty - which will be contested over the five Merseyside boroughs plus the Cheshire borough of Halton - has attracted eight candidates, but the main question will be whether Labour's Steve Rotheram, a former Lord Mayor of Liverpool and since 2010 MP for Liverpool Walton, will win in the first round or be pushed to transfers.  This contest has attracted eight candidates: in alphabetical order, Roger Bannister of the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition is a longstanding UNISON activist; Paul Breen is standing under the label "Get the Coppers Off the Jury"; the Tories have selected businessman Tony Caldeira who fought the Liverpool city mayoralty in 2012 and 2016; the Lib Dem candidate is Carl Cashman who leads the recently re-established party group on Knowsley council; the Greens' Tom Crone leads the party group on Liverpool council; Tabitha Morton stands for the Women's Equality Party and civil servant Paula Walters is the UKIP candidate.  There are two local by-elections in the county: in <b>Wavertree</b> ward of Liverpool (once a Lib Dem powerhouse represented by council leaders Mike Storey and Warren Bradley), and over the river in Birkenhead's <b>Claughton</b> ward; both these wards are safe Labour and should return Clare McIntyre to Liverpool council and Gillian Wood to Wirral council.

Apart from the Liverpool City Region mayor election in Halton, there are no polls in <em>Cheshire</em> on 4th May.  In case you were worried that I'd forgotten Election Data's own <em>Greater Manchester</em>, fear not: that will be the subject of Part II of this preview next week as we go back to the normal format and the usual level of detail.

<h2>YORKSHIRE AND THE HUMBER</h2>

Yorkshire is one of the quieter regions this year.  With Humberside county council long gone, none of the West Yorkshire councils having signed a devolution deal and the South Yorkshire mayoral election postponed to 2018, the major contest here will be for <em>North Yorkshire</em> county council.  This is currently strongly Conservative, and the Tories' task in holding on here is made easier by the fact that they have won two seats in the Vale of York - Stillington and Thirsk - unopposed.  An organisational error has meant that Labour have managed to nominate two candidates in Hertford and Cayton, a rural division covering the countryside around Filey - although it's not as if Labour had a chance of winning the seat anyway.  One by-election is combined with the county election, in <b>Aire Valley with Lothersdale</b> ward of Craven council - a series of commuter villages to the south of Skipton - where the defending Tory candidate Gemma Harling is opposed only by the Green Party.

The former <em>Humberside</em> has no elections of any sort on 4th May; a recent vacancy in Brumby ward of Scunthorpe arose too late to be called for 4th May.

The one local by-election in <em>West Yorkshire</em> is in <b>Queensbury</b>.  Did somebody say Queensbury?

https://youtu.be/A9cE8OFjUQA

(Got it right this time.)  Yes, that's Queensbury's finest export, the superlative Black Dyke Band who are the ambassadors for a very strange ward of Bradford council on the hill towards Halifax.  Queensbury's election results in recent years have been dominated by Lynda and Paul Cromie, who were originally elected as BNP councillors but have since left the party and both been re-elected as independents; Lynda lost her seat to the Tories in 2015 but returned in 2016 with the Tories pushed into fourth place behind UKIP and Labour, and it is the Tory seat which is up in this by-election.  With no Cromie on the ballot this time, the defending Tory candidate Andrew Senior is challenged by independent Jason Smith - who was the UKIP candidate here last year - Mobeen Hussain for Labour, Eithne Dodwell for the Greens and Mary Whitrick for the Lib Dems.

Finishing in <em>South Yorkshire</em> where the Mayor and council are up for re-election in <b>Doncaster</b>.  Labour mayor Ros Jones, who defeated the English Democrats' Peter Davies in 2013, is seeking re-election for a second term and is opposed by independent Eddie Todd, George Jabbour of the Conservatives, Steve Williams of the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition, UKIP's Brian Whitmore and Chris Whitwood standing for the Yorkshire Party.  The only by-election in the county on 4th May is for <b>Southey</b> ward on the northern edge of Sheffield, where Mike Chaplin will look to succeed the Labour deputy leader of the council Leigh Bramall; one notable feature of this poll is the presence on the ballot of Carol Keen, the first local by-election candidate for the Women's Equality Party.

<h2>EAST MIDLANDS</h2>

Now we get into the two-tier heartland of England by passing into the Midlands.  Two of the East Midlands counties which will be closely watched this year are Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire, both Labour gains in the 2013 election: <em>Nottinghamshire</em> in particular looks vulnerable given the state of the current polls.  There have been no local by-elections in Nottinghamshire so far this year but there are three on 4th May.  <b>Sherwood</b> ward in eastern Nottingham is a safe ward which should return Labour's Adele Williams; veteran by-election candidate and Elvis impersonator David Bishop, who once finished ahead of the Lib Dems in a by-election to Nottingham council, may have hung up his blue suede shoes at the parliamentary level but is still tempted to try his luck once more in his home city.  In Newark and Sherwood district, Labour are defending the safe <b>Ollerton</b> ward on what is now the ex-Nottinghamshire coalfield, while in Rushcliffe the Tories face a contest in <b>Thoroton</b> ward, a rural area east of Bingham where they were unopposed in 2015.  Labour's Neal Mitchell and the Tories' Sarah Bailey should face few problems in their respective contests.

In <em>Derbyshire</em> there are no by-elections to detract from the county election in which Labour have a large but not particularly strong majority.  The one pending poll in the county, in Woodville ward of South Derbyshire, was intended to be called for 4th May but the deadline for doing so was missed, and this ward will now poll on 11th May.

A similar situation pertains in <em>Lincolnshire</em> where there are no pending by-elections of any sort.  Lincolnshire county council is hung at present but the Tories should have no trouble regaining control: the large UKIP cohort elected in 2013 has fallen apart and the Lincolnshire Independents seem, judging from the candidate list, to be less well organised than in recent years.

The Tories' majority on <em>Leicestershire</em> council is small - 32 seats out of 55 - but looks secure at first sight.  The county elections are combined with three by-elections, all in marginal wards.  In the northern Leicester suburb of Birstall the defending Tory candidate Roy Rollings in <b>Birstall Wanlip</b> ward will be challenged by the Lib Dems' Simon Sansome for a seat on Charnwood council.  The other two by-elections are in neighbouring wards in the north-west corner of Melton Mowbray: in <b>Melton Egerton</b> ward the seat previously held by independent Tina Culley will be fought over by Peter Faulkner for the Tories (who hold the ward's other seat) and Mike Brown for Labour, while in <b>Melton Sysonby</b> ward the Tories' Alison Freer-Jones should hold the seat against Labour's Vanessa Jackson.  There are no elections of any sort this May in <em>Rutland</em>.

Finally in this region we come to the safe Tory <em>Northamptonshire</em> council where there are no fewer than five by-elections on 4th May, all defended by the Conservatives.  Two of these are in Kettering district: <b>St Peter's</b> ward on the western edge of Kettering should be held by the Tories' Paul Marks, while <b>Burton Latimer</b> ward to the south-east is shaping up to be an interesting three-way contest between defending Tory candidate John Currall, independent Christopher Groome (whose wife is already a councillor for the ward) and UKIP's Sam Watts.  In East Northamptonshire district <b>Prebendal</b> ward (a rural ward to the north of Oundle, including the village of Fotheringhay) should be safe for the wonderfully-named Annabel de Capell Brooke, while Malcolm Longley should hold <b>Long Buckby</b> ward in Daventry district and, in the western corner of the county, <b>Kings Sutton</b> ward should be an easy defence for Gregor Hopkins.

<hr>

<h2>WEST MIDLANDS</h2>

Moving west of Watling Street we come to <em>Warwickshire</em>, a county council which the Tories lost overall control of in 2013 due to losses in marginal Nuneaton and industrial North Warwickshire.  Labour put in a good performance last year in Nuneaton, although not good enough to make safe the Labour by-election defence in the marginal <b>Bulkington</b> ward - a village to the south-east of Nuneaton which has produced some very close results in recent years.  This by-election is a straight fight between Labour's Jack Bonner and the Tories' Rich Smith.  There are three more by-elections in Warwickshire on 4th May, two of them in Rugby: the Tories' Sebastian Lowe should hold <b>Coton and Boughton</b>, a ward of new estates on the northern edge of town, while Labour's Mike Brader is not under serious threat in <b>New Bilton</b> ward covering western Rugby.  The UKIP candidate for New Bilton had his nomination papers ruled out of order and UKIP will not be on the ballot there.  In Stratford-on-Avon district the Tories' Penny-Anne O'Donnell should hold <b>Ettington</b> ward, a rural area centred on the Fosse Way south-east of Stratford.

<em>Worcestershire</em> county council should be an easy defence for the Tories, and its election is combined with five by-elections.  One of them is the only Green by-election defence on 4th May, in the <b>West</b> ward of Malvern Hills: this is the village of West Malvern, and new Green candidate Natalie McVey should hold the seat even with the intervention of Labour and the Lib Dems.  The other four Worcestershire by-elections are Conservative defences and only one of those looks in serious danger: that's <b>Mitton</b> ward in Stourport-on-Severn, which returned a full slate of Tories to Wyre Forest council in 2015 but the party finished third in the ward last year behind Kidderminster Health Concern and UKIP.  Howard Williams defends for the Conservatives against John Thomas for Health Concern, John Holden for UKIP, Cliff Brewer for Labour and two other candidates.  Turning to the other Tory defences, in Wychavon district Sital Harris should win <b>Droitwich South East</b> and Matt Snape should win <b>Evesham South</b>, while Bill Amos should hold <b>Bedwardine</b> ward in Worcester.

There are no elections of any sort this May in <em>Herefordshire</em>, while in <em>Shropshire</em> the unitary county council is up.  The Tories have a decent majority on Shropshire council but their administration is scandal-prone which has led to some embarrassing by-election performances, the most spectacular of which was losing the former council leader's seat in Oswestry to the Green Party.

Turning to <em>Staffordshire</em>, a county which the Tories hold with a small majority which should be impregnable on current polling.  There are five local by-elections in Staffordshire including a rare double by-election in Stafford, with both seats up in the safe Labour ward of <b>Highfields and Western Downs</b> in the west of the town.  David Barron and Mike Winkle form the new Labour slate.  Lichfield district will see a change in composition: the council's only UKIP member has resigned his seat in <b>Fazeley</b> ward - a Tamworth suburb - and the party are not defending the by-election.  This should be picked up by either Brian Hoult for the Tories or Glen Mynott for Labour.  We're only five months into the year but East Staffordshire district is already having its third and fourth by-elections of 2017; <b>Shobnall</b> ward in central Burton (including the town's wonderful town hall) should be a safe defence for Labour's Paul Walker, but <b>Horninglow</b> ward in north-western Burton is a marginal which Labour's Louise Walker (Paul's wife) will have to defend from the Tories' Deneice Florence-Jukes.  Finally, the Tories' Jo Chapman should have little trouble in defending <b>Penkridge West</b> ward on South Staffordshire council.

The West Midlands metropolitan districts are not up this year.  Instead we have the inaugural <em>West Midlands</em> mayoral election, which is shaping up to be a tight race between Labour's Siôn Simon, an MEP for the West Midlands since 2014 and MP for Birmingham Erdington 2001-10; and the Tories' Andy Street, former managing director of the John Lewis Partnership.  Also on the ballot are 2016 PCC candidate Pete Durnell for UKIP, businesswoman Beverley Nielsen for the Lib Dems, James Burn for the Green Party who leads the surprisingly large Green group on Solihull council, and Graham Stevenson of the Communist Party of Britain.  The mayoral election is combined with two by-elections in Birmingham; Labour candidate Liz Clements' task in defending the safe <b>Hall Green</b> ward has been made even easier by the Tories having to disown their candidate Obaid Khan for anti-Semitism; while the Lib Dems' Morriam Jan will defend the Lib Dem ward of <b>Perry Barr</b> which has been a Labour target for years without ever falling into their grasp.

<hr>

<h2>EASTERN</h2>

Turning our gaze from the heights of the West Midlands to the flatlands of East Anglia, we start in <em>Cambridgeshire</em> with the Tories' best shot in any of this year's mayoral elections.  The <b>Cambridgeshire and Peterborough</b> mayoralty is easily the strongest Conservative area of the six combined authorities, and on current polling the Tory candidate James Palmer, leader of East Cambridgeshire council, should be targeting a win in the first round even taking into account the Tories' weakness in Cambridge.  His opponents are Labour's Kevin Price, deputy leader of Cambridge council; Cambridge councillor Rod Cantrill for the Lib Dems; Paul Bullen, who leads the UKIP group on Cambridgeshire county council; the Greens' Julie Howell, a parish councillor for the Peterborough suburb of Orton; former UKIP figure Peter Dawe as an independent and former Peterborough councillor Stephen Goldspink for the English Democrats.

Another big prize for the Tories this year is Cambridgeshire county council, which they presently run as a minority with 32 seats against 14 Lib Dems, 10 UKIP, 8 Labour and 5 independents.  On current polling most of the UKIP seats should go back to the Tories, but the county has extensive boundary changes this year with 7 seats disappearing.  There are also three local by-elections.  In South Cambridgeshire district the Tories look safe in <b>Bourn</b> ward, which covers the miniature New Town of Cambourn and whose population has more than quadrupled in the last twenty years: Ruth Betson is the defending candidate here.  The same cannot be said of <b>St Neots Eaton Ford</b> ward of Huntingdonshire district, a normally-safe ward which the Conservatives resoundingly lost to an independent last year; that wasn't a flash in the pan as a slate of independents has done very well in St Neots over the last couple of years, so this could be an interesting fight between the Tories' Keith Prentice and the independents' Charles Bober.  Last on this lst is <b>Arbury</b> ward in northern Cambridge, which was Lib Dem at their high-water mark but now looks safe for Labour's Patrick Sheil.

<em>Norfolk</em> county council did different in its 2013 election with the Tories losing control largely off the back of UKIP advances in Great Yarmouth, Thetford and some rural divisions.  UKIP, Labour, the Lib Dems and Greens somehow put together a rainbow coalition to run the council, but this fell apart after three years and the Tories, thanks to good by-election performances and the defection of a former Green councillor, are now back in minority control with 42 out of 84 seats.  This is a nailed-on Tory gain next week.  There are two local by-elections in the county: <b>Harling and Heathlands</b>, a deeply rural area a few miles east of Thetford, was Tory unopposed in 2015 and should return Robert Kybird to Breckland council; but <b>Holt</b>, a small market town in North Norfolk, will be closely contested between the defending Lib Dems and the Conservatives, who hold the ward's other seat: Naomi Farrow defends, Duncan Baker - who was the UKIP candidate for the ward two years ago but now appears under the Conservative banner - hopes to gain.

In <em>Suffolk</em> the Conservatives won a small majority in the 2013 county council election - 39 seats to 15 Labour, 9 UKIP, 7 Lib Dems, 3 Independents and 2 Greens - which has since disappeared thanks to a series of appalling by-election performances, one of them coming after a Tory county councillor moved to the USA but refused to resign until finally falling foul of the non-attendance rule eighteen months later.  That seat was lost to the Lib Dems, putting the ruling Tory group down to 37 seats against a combined opposition of 38.  The UKIP seats in Suffolk are concentrated in urban divisions in Lowestoft, Haverhill, Newmarket and Stowmarket, with most of the rural opposition to the Tories coming from the Lib Dems and Greens which may be more difficult pickups.  Nonetheless with only one net gain required the chances are Suffolk will return a Tory majority this time.  There is a by-election to Ipswich council from the key marginal ward of <b>Stoke Park</b> in the south of the town; the Tories are defending the seat but Labour won the ward last year by a majority of twenty votes.  Bob Hall defends for the Tories, Collette Allen challenges for Labour.  The county's other by-election comes in Mid Suffolk in the village of <b>Eye</b>, where independent councillor Charles Flatman is retiring after forty-three years' service in local government; in 2015 he was challenged only by the Greens, so this by-election is something of a free-for-all.  The Green candidate from last time Simon Hooton is trying again and is joined on the ballot paper by John Blake for the Lib Dems, Michael Burke for the Conservatives and Alex Wilson for Labour.

The county of <em>Essex</em> is not likely to see much interest this year, with the Tories defending a large majority on the county council and in the <b>Moulsham and Central</b> by-election, covering Chelmsford town centre, which should be safe for Conservative candidate Gilbert Smith.  The county's other by-election comes in the north-west corner of the county in the rural <b>Newport</b> ward of Uttlesford district, which in 2015 voted strongly for the localist "Residents for Uttlesford" slate.  R4U have since gained the neighbouring ward of Elsenham and Henham in a by-election and their new candidate Anthony Gerrard looks odds-on to hold.

There is even less of interest in <em>Bedfordshire</em>, whose county council was abolished in 2009.  The only polls in the county this May are two by-elections to safe Tory wards of the safe Tory Central Bedfordshire council.  Steven Watkins should hold <b>Biggleswade North</b> for the Tories while Mark Liddiard is favoured in <b>Shefford</b>.

In this region we've saved the best till last with no fewer than ten by-elections scheduled in <em>Hertfordshire</em>.  Three of those are in the town of Watford: Labour defend <b>Leggatts</b> ward in North Watford while the Lib Dems defend <b>Park</b> on the western edge of town and <b>Oxhey</b> ward around Bushey railway station: all of these are safe wards which should return Richard Smith, Peter Jeffree and Maggie Parker respectively.  Two polls to watch in a key marginal constituency are <b>Roebuck</b> ward in the south-west corner of Stevenage, with Labour's Monika Cherney-Craw defending a seat which was marginal in 2015 but safe enough in 2016, while still within the Stevenage constituency but outside the borough to the east the Tories' Tony Stowe defends their safe ward of <b>Datchworth and Aston</b>.  There are also safe Conservative defences in <b>Hitchin Priory</b> and <b>Royston Heath</b> wards of North Hertfordshire district, <b>Panshanger</b> ward on the eastern edge of Welwyn Garden City, <b>Potters Bar Oakmere</b> ward in Hertsmere district and <b>Berkhamsted West</b> in the curiously-named Dacorum district: those should respectively return Raymond Shakespeare-Smith, Sarah Dingley, Terry Mitchinson, Sarah Hodgson-Jones and Anthony Armitage.  Some of these by-elections may yet prove to be more interesting than the Hertfordshire county council election, where the Tories have a strong majority which looks in no danger whatsoever.

<hr>

<h2>GREATER LONDON</h2>

In local election terms London is the odd region out this year.  This is an odd-numbered year so there are no elections to the London boroughs or the London Mayor and Assembly, and by-election watchers in the capital have had rather meagre pickings of late with just two polls so far this year, both of them in Harrow.  This trend has continued with only one London local by-election scheduled for 4th May, in the <b>Gospel Oak</b> ward of Camden.  Gospel Oak voted Conservative in 2006 but had a big Labour lead at the last borough elections in 2014, and it's difficult to bet against a hold for the defending Labour candidate Marcus Boyland.

<hr>

<h2>SOUTH EAST</h2>

Quickly back out of the Smoke and we are now in the Conservative heartland of the south east.  <em>Buckinghamshire</em> is one of those heartland counties and the Tory majority in the notoriously ugly county hall is under no threat.  More interest will be provided by two by-elections in the Chiltern hills south-east of Aylesbury: the Tories defend the safe ward of <b>Wendover and Halton</b> in Aylesbury Vale district, while in Chiltern district they will be looking to regain a seat in the neighbouring ward of <b>Great Missenden</b> previously held by an independent councillor.  Both of these wards lie on the proposed route of High Speed 2 which is massively unpopular in the area.  Richard Newcombe should hold Wendover and Halton, while Great Missenden is a free-for-all between the Tories' Vanessa Martin, Anna Brazil for the Greens, Alan Stevens for UKIP and Ruth Yeoman for the Lib Dems.

In next-door <em>Oxfordshire</em> the Conservatives' inability to win seats in Oxford, combined with losses to the Lib Dems in Abingdon and Labour in Banbury, cost the Tories overall control in 2013.  The Tories are one seat short of a majority so this county should be a straightforward gain in May.  There are two local by-elections in the county next week.  Robert Courts' win in the Witney by-election last year means he is giving up his council seat of <b>The Bartons</b> in West Oxfordshire district: the new Tory candidate Charles Virgin appears to be fighting his first election campaign but is favoured to break his duck in this safe ward.  In the city of Oxford Labour should have a safe defence in <b>Barton and Sandhills</b> ward, the first part of Oxford that people coming in on the road from London see: Mark Ladbrooke is the defending candidate.

<em>Berkshire</em> county council was abolished in the 1990s, so by-elections provide the only interest.  There are two of them, and both are in interesting and idiosyncratic wards.  On the south side of the Thames is <b>Clewer North</b> ward of Windsor and Maidenhead council; in this ward of north-west Windsor defending Tory candidate Lars Swann is up against independent Wisdom da Costa, who had a big win in the last by-election to this ward in July 2014 but lost his seat in the ordinary election ten months later.  On the other side of the river, <b>Haymill and Lynch Hill</b> is Slough's north-western corner at the point where the town merges seamlessly into Burnham.  This isn't your typical Slough ward at all, and that's reflected in some volatile election results: in 2014 the ward elected two Tories and one UKIPper who was seven votes ahead of the Labour slate; the UKIP vote has collapsed here since and their seat went to the Tories in 2015, but if the 2016 result is anything to go by the Labour vote in the ward is still relatively healthy.  The defending Conservative candidate is Paul Kelly, while Labour have selected Jemma Davis.

Conservative control of <em>Hampshire</em> county council looks set to continue for another four years.  The county has four by-elections on 4th May.  <b>St John's</b> ward in western Farnborough should be a hold for the Conservatives' Jonathan Canty, while there are two safe Lib Dem defences in the fast-growing suburbia north of Southampton: <b>Valley Park</b> ward, which lies on the western edge of Chandler's Ford but falls on the other side of the district boundary in Test Valley district, and <b>Eastleigh Central</b> around the town's railway station and yards.  Christopher Thom and Tina Campbell should respectively hold those seats.  Finally, in the south-eastern corner of the county against the Sussex boundary the Conservative's Richard Kennett should be elected to Havant council from the safe <b>Emsworth</b> ward.

Which brings us nicely on to <em>West Sussex</em>, which has excelled itself with seven by-elections, four of which are in Chichester district.  Despite the name, Chichester district covers a huge swathe of western Sussex all the way up to the North Downs, in which lies the rural <b>Plaistow</b> ward which is having its sixth by-election in fourteen years.  (What's going on there?)  In all five of the previous by-elections the runner-up has been Raymond Cooper of the Lib Dems, and he looks set to miss out a sixth time with Peter Wilding favoured to hold for the Conservatives.  None of the three other Tory defences in Chichester look in serious trouble: they are <b>Bosham</b> on Chichester Harbour, <b>East Wittering</b> on the coast - where former Labour parliamentary candidate Andrew Emerson stands for his own far-right outfit, Patria - and <b>North Mundham</b> ward between Chichester and Bognor which was Tory unopposed in 2015.  These should return respectively Andy Collins, Keith Martin and Chris Page.  The other three West Sussex by-elections all lie on the Brighton Line corridor: in the Tory one-party state of Mid Sussex the rural <b>Bolney</b> ward is defended by Judy Llewellyn-Burke and <b>Burgess Hill Franklands</b> ward by Claire Fussell, while further north the <b>Maidenbower</b> ward of south-eastern Crawley should elect the Tories' Nigel Boxall.  None of these by-elections are particularly interesting, and neither is the West Sussex county election where the Tories have a large majority and lots of UKIP seats on the coastal strip to gain.

By way of contrast, there are no by-elections in <em>East Sussex</em> to distract from what looks like a fascinating county council election.  The Conservatives underperformed here in 2013, losing seats to UKIP on the coastal strip and to Labour in Hastings, and they currently run a minority administration with 21 out of 49 seats.  The Conservatives will be looking to win back control, while the Lib Dems will be looking for a good performance in Eastbourne which - notwithstanding the large Leave vote in Eastbourne town - is one of their top target seats for the forthcoming general election.

As usual the picture in <em>Surrey</em> will be one of Tory domination, and this extends to the county's three by-elections.  The North Downs commuter territory of <b>Tadworth and Walton</b> (on the Tattenham Corner line) in Reigate and Banstead district, and the ex-Middlesex suburbia of <b>Ashford East</b> (on the Waterloo-Windsor line) in Spelthorne district, should elect their Tory candidates George Curry and Alex Sapunovas without much trouble.  Over in Runnymede district, <b>Foxhills</b> ward (based on the village of Ottershaw) voted UKIP in a March 2013 by-election but is now safely back in the Tory fold, and the Conservatives' Emma Bancroft should hold this one.  In the county elections, one racing certainty is that the Tories will get back their seat in Shalford, which was lost to UKIP in 2013 after the Conservatives failed to submit their nomination papers and weren't on the ballot.

The Tories have a small majority on <em>Kent</em> county council with UKIP as the largest opposition group, but it's Labour who have the most to lose from Kent's six by-elections on 4th May.  Two of these are in key marginal wards in Northfleet, part of Gravesham council, following the retirement of a husband and wife couple of Labour councillors: in both <b>Coldharbour</b> and <b>Painters Ash</b> wards the only Labour seat is up for election in wards which have split representation between Labour and Conservative councillors.  Shane Mochrie-Cox and Elizabeth Mulheran are the defending Labour candidates, with Gary Harding and Conrad Broadley hoping to make the gains.  Another Kent town with two by-elections is Dover: Labour are defending <b>Buckland</b> ward, in the north of the town off the old road to London, which was just about marginal with UKIP in 2015; while in the cumbersomely-named ward of <b>Maxton, Elms Vale and Priory</b>, running from Dover Priory station along the old road to Folkestone, UKIP are defending a three-way marginal ward where Labour hold the other two seats and the Conservatives held a seat from 2003 to 2015.  The Buckland by-election is defended for Labour by Nathaniel Richards with Tim Turner standing for UKIP, while the defending UKIP candidate in Maxton, Elms Vale and Priory is Peter McDermott with Ann Napier challenging for Labour and Roger Walkden for the Conservatives.  The Maidstone suburb of <b>Bearsted</b> was close between the Tories and an independent last year, but the defending Conservatives have neutralised the independent threat by selecting last year's independent candidate Denis Spooner.  Completing this list of Kent by-elections is the safe Tory ward of <b>Aylesford North and Walderslade</b>, covering the North Downs between Maidstone and Chatham and including some outlying Chatham estates; Des Keers should be favoured for election here.

Finally in this region, we go offshore to the <em>Isle of Wight</em>.  The island's single council is up for election this year, so there are no by-elections here on 4th May.  Wight hasn't shown much political stability in recent years: in the 2013 council election the Conservatives lost control to an independent group which is currently running the council, while at parliamentary level the island's Tory MP Andrew Turner is reportedly unpopular with his local party and the Greens did very well in 2015.  This could be one to watch.

<h2>SOUTH WEST</h2>

Our final English region is worth the wait: the South West.  The marquee contest is the <em>West of England</em> mayoralty, covering the city of Bristol and the two neighbouring councils of South Gloucestershire, and Bath and North East Somerset.  This is the most unpredictable of all the mayoral elections this year, with all three main parties having genuine hopes of a win.  The front-runner, if the 2015 general election vote is anything to go by, is the Conservatives' Tim Bowles, a South Gloucestershire councillor who runs an events company.  However, this is a Supplementary Vote contest and the Tories, whose polltopping score across the area in 2015 was only 37%, could be given a run for their money or even overtaken in the final round.  Hoping to be in that runoff are Labour candidate Lesley Mansell, a manager in the NHS and parish councillor in Westfield, Somerset; and the Lib Dems' Stephen Williams, MP for Bristol West from 2005 to 2015 and, in your columnist's experience, a decent recreational quizzer.  UKIP's candidate is Aaron Foot, a farmer who stood for Avon and Somerset police and crime commissioner that year, while the Greens have selected former RAF officer Darren Hall.  Completing the ballot paper is John Savage, a businessman who was Labour candidate for Avon and Somerset PCC in 2012 but is now an independent candidate.

Moving up the Severn estuary, the Conservatives will be hopeful of gaining control of <em>Gloucestershire</em>, which they lost in 2013 thanks to poor performances in Cotswold district, whose administration has been scandal-prone in recent years; and in the Forest of Dean where UKIP performed well in 2013.  There's only one by-election to distract from that contest, in <b>All Saints</b> ward which covers part of Cheltenham town centre; this is a safe Lib Dem ward and their candidate Alex Hegenbarth should hold easily.

The unitary <em>Wiltshire</em> council is up this year, and the council's large Tory majority doesn't look in danger.  Neither is neighbouring <em>Dorset</em> county council, whose two by-elections, both Lib Dem defences, will provide the most interest in the county: <b>Gillingham Town</b> in North Dorset district is a split ward where the Lib Dems are defending their seat and the other two councillors are Conservatives.  Barry von Clemens - who was on the Labour slate for this ward two years ago - defends for the Lib Dems, while the Chase is on for the Conservatives' Alexander Chase.  The other by-election is in the politically volatile <b>Westham East</b> ward of the politically volatile Weymouth and Portland borough: facing Weymouth town centre on the west side of the harbour, Westham East has voted for all three main parties since 2010, which was also the last occasion any councillor for the ward was re-elected; in 2016 the Lib Dems gained the ward from Labour by eleven votes.  Andreas Scheffler seeks to defend for the Liberal Democrats with David Greenhalf hoping to gain for Labour.

Now we're coming into the real West Country, where despite the region's Brexity nature the Liberal Democrats have been putting in some eye-catching by-election performances over the last eleven months.  On the back of that, the yellows have hopes of making big gains in <em>Somerset</em>, a county with a relatively small Tory majority and lots of marginal divisions.  Somerset's five by-elections on 4th May are a bizarre bunch.  Starting in Bath, where the Tories have the difficult task of defending <b>Newbridge</b> ward, on the western edge of the city along the road to Bristol, after former councillor Donal Hassett was found guilty of conspiring to produce cannabis: he had used fake papers to rent four properties which were turned into cannabis factories, and is currently on remand with sentencing scheduled for 5th May.  This is a split Tory/Lib Dem ward where the Greens also did well in 2015: Rob Hawking has the task of defending for the Tories against Lib Dem Michelle O'Doherty and the Greens' Dick Daniel.  The strangeness doesn't end there as we enter Zummerrzet proper: in Mendip district the Tories are defending another split Tory/Lib Dem ward in <b>Frome College</b>, the northern of the six wards covering Frome.  Carol Bullen defends for the Tories, Alex Shingler will try to gain for the Lib Dems, and further down the ballot continuing Liberal Party candidate Derek Tanswell feels that he is sufficiently on first-name terms with the electorate to appear on the ballot paper only as "Derek".  Yet another bizarre by-election where the Tories are defending their seat in a split ward is in <b>Minehead North</b>...

...no, not that one.  North Minehead may be Conservative at other levels of government, but on the tiny West Somerset district council its last election saw one Tory and one UKIPper elected unopposed.  The only previous contested election on these boundaries, in 2011, saw an independent top the poll and the Conservatives win the other seat.  Goodness knows what'll happen here this time.  Droning on and on and on until foaming at the mouth and falling over backwards (allegedly) is Andrew Kingston-James, who is opposed by Lib Dem Benet Allen, independent Sally Kuhlmann-Hall, Labour candidate Maureen Smith and, perhaps thankfully, no National Bocialist.  Somerset's other two by-elections are more ordinary affairs: in Sedgemoor district <b>Bridgwater Eastover</b>, the central of seven wards in a stubbornly Labour town, should be held for Labour by Chelsea Chadwick, while South Somerset's <b>Blackmoor Vale</b> ward, a rural area on the Dorset border centred on Templecombe, is safe Tory and should elect Hayward Burt.

The last six 4th May by-elections of what has been a marathon edition of Andrew's Previews can be found in <em>Devon</em>.  In the county town of Exeter Labour are defending the safe <b>St Thomas</b> ward on the west bank of the Exe, which was greatly expanded in boundary changes last year to Labour's benefit: the old St Thomas ward was a Labour/Lib Dem marginal, but it combined with most of the former Cowick ward - a Labour/Tory marginal - to create a safe Labour seat.  Heather Morris is the defending candidate.  Covering the countryside immediately to the north-east of Exeter in East Devon district are the neighbouring Tory/Lib Dem marginal wards of <b>Broadclyst</b> and <b>Whimple</b>, both of which are Tory defences and both of which are straight fights: Broadclyst sees Ray Bloxham defending for the Tories and Eleanor Rylance challenging for the Lib Dems, while Whimple ward is a contest between Mark Evans-Martin in the blue corner and former ward councillor Martin Gammell in the yellow corner.  Further down the south coast are another pair of neighbouring wards in Teignbridge district: on the south bank of the Teign is <b>Bushell</b> ward, which covers Newton Abbot town centre and railway station, yet another Tory/Lib Dem marginal with Liz Roberts defending for the Conservatives and Robert Hayes challenging for the Lib Dems; while on the north bank is the idiosyncratic <b>Kingsteignton East</b> ward where wildly popular Tory councillor Mike Walters is standing down; his seat will be defended by Ron Peart, whose biggest challenge on paper may well come from ex-UKIP independent Tony Dempster.  On the far side of the county is our last by-election in the <b>Bere Ferrers</b> ward of West Devon, a sprawling area between the Tamar and Tavy valleys: this by-election surely can't be as close as the 2011 election here, when Lib Dem Charles Musgrave and Conservative Andrew Sadleir tied for the last seat on 486 votes each, Musgrave winning the drawing of lots: in 2015 the ward elected an independent and a Tory candidate, and this by-election for the Tory seat is defended for them by Brian Lamb.

That's the end of our tour of 4th May's local by-elections in England, but there is one county yet left to describe.  The unitary <em>Cornwall</em> council is up for election this year, and after making big gains in the Cornish by-elections held since 2013 the Liberal Democrats, who hold 42 out of 123 seats and run the council in coalition with the Independent group, are hopeful of making enough gains to control the council in their own right.  In a place as riddled with personal votes and local factors as Cornwall few things can be predicted with certainty, but one is that 4th May will not mark the end of the election here: the outgoing Lib Dem councillor for Bodmin St Petroc ward has recently died and, as he was standing for re-election, the poll in that ward has been cancelled and will be re-run at a later date.  That will be covered in the usual amount of detail on Andrew's Previews in due course.  Also up for election this year is the UK's smallest principal council, the non-partisan <em>Isles of Scilly</em>; we wait with bated breath to see whether the island of St Mary's will elect as one of its twelve councillors the candidate who has rather hopefully given a home address in, er, Northolt, Middlesex.

For all that this column has been long, it can do no more than scratch the surface of the ordinary elections - and this is the quietest year of the UK's local electoral cycle.  It's time yet again to re-make the ten-thousand-piece psephological jigsaw that is Great Britain; to withdraw some old pieces and replace them with new ones, repaint some areas in a completely different colour while only subtly changing the hue of others, and throw the whole thing up in the air again to see how it lands.  After it's over we'll nod sagely at some results, boggle in amazement at others, and generally try to make sense of it all.  But none of that can happen without votes being cast.  Come 4th May your columnist will be casting his vote in the Greater Manchester mayoral election; if there are local elections in your area this year, please do likewise.
