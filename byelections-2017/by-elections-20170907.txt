Fourteen by-elections on 7th September 2017:

HEDNESFORD AND RAWNSLEY (Staffordshire county council);
HEDNESFORD GREEN HEATH (Cannock Chase council); and
HEDNESFORD SOUTH (Cannock Chase council)

The first and second vacancies are caused by the death of Conservative county and district councillor Graham Burnett at the age of 59.  The third vacancy is caused by the disqualification of Conservative councillor Joanne Christian, who failed to attend any council meetings in six months.  Burnett, who had co-founded a company supplying equipment and training to people working at height using ropes, had served on Cannock Chase council from 2008 to 2012 from Hednesford North ward and since 2015 from Hednesford Green Heath ward; he had been a Staffordshire county councillor for less than two months, having been elected in May for the first time.  Christian had served since gaining her seat from Labour in 2015.

The summer holidays are well and truly over, and it's time for us to enter the autumn months.  Autumn is the peak time for local by-elections, and we certainly start this autumn with a bang: fourteen polls have been organised for today, the biggest polling day so far in this Parliament.  Three of them are in the small Midlands town of Hednesford, which makes it a good place to start.

Hednesford (pronounced Hedgeford if you're an old local, Hensford otherwise) is a town just to the north of Cannock, on the southern slopes of Cannock Chase much of which is within the division.  As well as being a well-known forest and beauty spot, Cannock Chase has several connections with central and eastern Europe: there is a cemetery here containing the graves of nearly 5,000 German and Austrian prisoners from the two world wars, a memorial to the victims of the Katyn massacre is located within the forest, while the former RAF Hednesford training camp was used in the 1950s as a refugee camp for Hungarians fleeing the Soviet put-down of the 1956 revolution.  Also within the area is the Hednesford Hills Raceway, a stock-car racing circuit built within a disused reservoir.  Hednesford's traditional industry was coalmining, but the end of mining hasn't led to the economic collapse seen in many places: the town is within commuting distance of Walsall and Birmingham and appears to be thriving, with high employment and owner-occupation rates.

This is reflected in a strong performance for the Conservatives in recent general elections.  The Cannock Chase constituency swung strongly to the Conservatives in June, against the national trend (although it is arguable that the Tories underperformed here in 2015 following well-publicised controversies involving former Tory MP Aidan Burley).  The good Tory performance here in June was presaged by a strong performance in May's county council elections, in which they gained four seats in Cannock Chase district from Labour including the two-seat Hednesford and Rawnsley division.  Hednesford and Rawnsley is a key marginal which was created in 2005 and has yo-yoed between the two main parties at every subsequent county election.  In June the Tory slate gained the division with 36%, to 28% for Labour and 25% for the Green Party.

That good Green performance was not a flash in the pan.  The Greens have a local government base here having surprisingly gained the rabbit-shaped Hednesford South ward in the 2016 district council elections: that year the Greens came from fourth place in 2015 to win with 43%, to 22% for the Conservatives and 21% for Labour.  In previous years it had generally been a tight Labour-Tory marginal, with the eight previous elections since the formation of the ward in 2002 resulting in five Labour wins and four Tory wins (the two parties split the two seats in 2002).  The recent Conservative dominance in Cannock Chase at parliamentary and county level has not fed through to the district council, which has a Labour majority.

Hednesford Green Heath ward, on the west side of town along Pye Green Road, is another tight Labour-Tory marginal, although the Lib Dems did come through the middle to win here in 2003; since then the two main parties both have three wins in the ward to their names.  At district level Green Heath last polled in 2015 and was a Tory gain with 41%, to 33% for Labour and 18% for UKIP.  Labour hold the other seat in the ward, which is up for election next year.  A quick look at previous election results in Hednesford will show several references to The Chase Independent Party; this has no connection with a well-known ITV teatime quiz show but is the political vehicle of Ron Turville, who was the Lib Dem district councillor for this ward from 2003 to 2007.

So, three Tory defences in three marginal wards which may well stand or fall together: both Green Heath and South wards are within the Hednesford and Rawnsley county division.  Taking the county by-election first, the defending Tory candidate is local resident Bryan Jones.  The Labour candidate is George Adamson, the leader of Cannock Chase district council who has represented Hednesford Green Heath ward since 2010 when he gained the seat from the Conservatives with a majority of four votes; Adamson was county councillor for Hednesford and Rawnsley from 2013 until losing his seat in May, and is looking to make a quick return to county level.  The Greens have reselected Paul Woodhead, district councillor for Hednesford South ward since 2016.  Completing the county ballot paper are John Bernard for UKIP, Ron Turville for the Chase Independent Party and Pat Ansell for the Liberal Democrats.

Bryan Jones is also the defending Conservative candidate in Green Heath ward for the district council.  At district level he is opposed by Labour candidate Linda Tait, who fought Heath Hayes East and Wimblebury ward in 2014.  The UKIP candidate is David Percox who fought the county council seat in 2017.  Completing the Green Heath ballot paper are Ron Turville for the Chase Independent Party and Robert Branson for the Green Party.

Finally, we come to the Hednesford South ballot paper where Philip Hewitt is the defending Tory candidate; he is the remaining county councillor for Hednesford and Rawnsley.  The Green candidate is Stuart Crabtree who is secretary of the party's Cannock Chase branch.  Labour have selected Patrick Frondigoun, who fought Cannock West (a reliable Conservative ward) in last year's district elections.  UKIP's John Bernard completes the ballot paper.

EYE, THORNEY AND NEWBOROUGH

Peterborough council, Cambridgeshire; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor David Sanders, who has retired from poltics after 20 years' service on Peterborough council, the last of those years as Mayor of Peterborough.  He had served since 1997.

http://www.andrewteale.me.uk/misc/peterborough-eye-thorney-newborough.png

Hednesford was the obvious place to start this week's previews, but the main centre of attention on 7th September 2017 is East Anglia which has five local by-elections.  We start our tour of East Anglia with the most crucial of those polls in the city of Peterborough - or, more accurately, just outside it.  The Eye, Thorney and Newborough ward covers the fens immediately to the east of the city; Eye, from an Anglo-Saxon word meaning "island", is the largest centre of population with around 3,700 electors (around 500 of whom will vote in a "mobile unit" parked in the Travelodge car park), but Thorney is traditionally the most important settlement in the ward.  Part of the Isle of Ely until 1965 when it was transferred to the new county of Huntingdon and Peterborough, Thorney had an abbey from Saxon times until the Dissolution, when the Abbey estate was granted to the Earls of Bedford.  In the seventeenth century a group of Walloon Huguenot refugees with expertise in fenland drainage settled in Thorney, and the 4th Earl of Bedford paid them a fantastic sum of money to create the rich farmland here which is still called the Bedford Levels.  The investment paid off, and Thorney developed as a farming village under the auspices of the Dukes of Bedford who erected much of the village's housing; many of the houses in Thorney are Victorian in the Gothic Revival style.

This ward has existed only since 2016 when the single-member Newborough ward was combined with the two-member Eye and Thorney ward.  That was a good change for the Conservatives, as Eye and Thorney was safe for them but Newborough was represented by an independent councillor, David Harrington, who had held the seat since defeating the controversial former council leader Neville Sanders (David's father) in 2006.  The 2016 election gave the Tories all three seats with 35%, to 22% for UKIP, 20% for Harrington and 13% for Labour; David Sanders topped the poll a long way ahead of his running-mates and clearly had a personal vote.  Nonetheless the Tories have good reason to be worried about this one; a by-election loss in June wiped out their majority on Peterborough city council, and a further loss here would put them in a minority with 29 out of 60 seats.

Defending for the Conservatives is Nigel Simons, who comes from a family with a tradition of public service: his father George Simons, his sister Sue Day and his nephew David Day have all served on the city council.  Nigel works in the plumbing and heating trade and also runs an outdoor combat business; like all the candidates except the Lib Dem, he gives an address in Thorney.  UKIP have reselected Mary Herdman, who was runner-up here last year and was also the party's parliamentary candidate for Peterborough in 2015.  Harrington is not standing again.  The Labour candidate is Christian DeFeo, who works for a publishing company and chairs the local branch of the Co-operative Party.  Completing the ballot paper are Michael Alexander for the Green Party (who fought the ward in 2016) and Callum Robertson of the Liberal Democrats.
