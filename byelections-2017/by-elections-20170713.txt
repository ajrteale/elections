Seven by-elections on 13th July 2017:

CHORLEYWOOD SOUTH AND MAPLE CROSS

Three Rivers council, Hertfordshire; caused by the death of Liberal Democrat councillor Ann Shaw.  First elected in 1971 to the former Rickmansworth urban district council, Shaw had sat on Three Rivers council since its foundation in 1974 and became Leader of the Council in 1986, stepping down from that role in 2016 as the longest-serving council leader in the country.  She was appointed OBE many years ago for political service.

The Local Government Boundary Commission have a difficult job sometimes, and their review of Three Rivers district in advance of the 2014 election was a particularly difficult one.  The district is a funny shape (as the 2015 map below illustrates), basically being all the bits of south-western Hertfordshire that were left over once Watford was taken out; combine this with an unhelpful population distribution and a requirement for three-councillor wards across the district, and the final result contains several wards that look rather strange.  In January this column discussed possibly the most extreme example, Gade Valley ward; Chorleywood South and Maple Cross isn't much better, combining a village with part of a town several miles away without so much as a road connecting them.

Maple Cross is a bit out on a limb within the district.  The southernmost village in Hertfordshire, this is one of the few genuinely rural areas remaining within the M25; however, Maple Cross is essentially a council-built village with almost all of its housing stock being post-war.  Even now the village lacks a church, although it does have several large corporations based here attracted by its proximity to the motorway and Heathrow Airport; the head office of Cadbury is here, as is the UK headquarters of Skanska.  However, the village's traditional industry is based on its proximity to the River Colne; watercress was grown here in the nineteenth century, while the Maple Lodge sewage treatment works is where all of western Hertfordshire's effluent ends up.

Chorleywood has an older history, with Paleolithic flints having been found in the area.  Once a Quaker town, it grew strongly following the opening of the Metropolitan Railway (now the Metropolitan line of the Underground) which connects the town to London, and was promoted to Urban District status in 1913.  The town has had an important impact on baking; the Chorleywood bread process, developed here in the 1960s to make dough from lower-protein wheat, is used to make four-fifths of the UK's bread.

Betjeman described Chorleywood as essential Metro-land, and it still has demographics to match.  The Chorleywood West ward which existed at the time of the 2011 census, most of which ended up in this ward, made the top 70 in England and Wales in the "lower management" economic category and was just outside the top 100 for the "higher management" category; altogether 57% of the ward's workforce are in some sort of management or professional role, with 51% being educated to degree level.  The old Maple Cross and Mill End ward was much closer to the national average, with much lower levels of owner-occupation reflecting the ward's history.

Both predecessor wards were safely Liberal Democrat before their abolition in 2014, and the present ward has normally continued in the same vein but did vote Conservative in 2015.  That was a general crash year for the Lib Dems in Three Rivers as the Tories rode the general election turnout to several unexpected wins and wiped out the Lib Dem majority.  The Lib Dems have since got their majority back by gaining Gade Valley ward in a by-election last January, but will need to hold this by-election to preserve their majority.  The 2016 result gives cause for optimism in that regard, although Shaw was the defending candidate that year: in her last re-election, she defeated the Conservatives 59-29.  In the Hertfordshire county elections in May Maple Cross was included in Rickmansworth West division, where the Tories had a majority of just 66 votes over the Lib Dems, while Chorleywood formed part of Three Rivers Rural division which was also a Tory-Lib Dem marginal.

Defending for the Lib Dems is Phil Williams, a cafe owner from Chorleywood who may be the son of a former Tory county and district councillor but was the Lib Dem candidate for Three Rivers Rural in May.  The Tory candidate is Colin Payne, a farmer from Chorleywood.  Also standing are Jack Hazlewood for Labour, Hazel Day for UKIP and Tab McLaughlin for the Green Party.
