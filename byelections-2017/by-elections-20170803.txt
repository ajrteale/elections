"All the right votes, but not necessarily in the right order"

The hit BBC2 quiz show <em>Only Connect</em> returned to our screens last week for a new series and included a set of four terms associated with elections, one of which has to the best of my knowledge never appeared in the six-year history of Andrew's Previews: "cleavage".  Clearly this a word all the smart political operators use, and it turns out that in a political sense cleavage can refer to any factor which could cause differences in voting behaviour: age, class, location, you name it.

So, like every edition of Andrew's Previews over the last six years, this week we will be dicussing cleavage and the effect it has on people.  It's a bit of a southern special this week, with four of the six 3rd August 2017 by-elections being south of the River Thames (three in Kent alone) and the other two being Labour defences in King's Lynn and Loughborough.  Before those Labour defences we discuss safe Conservative wards in Worthing and rural Kent; but we start this week with two Kent defences from that increasingly beleagured political force, UKIP.  Read on...



MARGATE CENTRAL

Thanet council, Kent; caused by the resignation of councillor Jeffrey Elenor who was elected as UKIP but had left the party.  He had served since 2015.

Welcome to what is described in its tourist information as a timeless seaside resort.  Margate has been serving bathers for 250 years, most of them coming from London 65 miles to the west.  Like many seaside resorts, Margate's economic base was severely damaged by the foreign package holiday revolution which made the Mediterranean or the Canaries, with their more relaxed lifestyle and better weather, more attractive holiday destinations; and Margate has been struggling to reinvent itself ever since.  It has attempted to do so by playing on its history and particularly its association with the artist J M W Turner: the Turner Contemporary art gallery, opened in 2011 in a striking modern building on the seafront, is described as the largest exhibition space in south-east England outside London.  Margate is home to the world's second-oldest rollercoaster, the Scenic Railway at Dreamland, which was opened in 1920 and reopened in 2015 after being severely damaged by fire some years previously.  

Dreamland and the Turner Contemporary lie at opposite ends of Margate Central ward, which also claims another second-oldest - the Theatre Royal, established in 1787 and rebuilt after being destroyed by fire in 1829, is the UK's second-oldest theatre.  Also within the boundary is Margate's old town centre and the headquarters of Thanet district council.  Despite all this unemployment is extremely high - 11.2% at the 2011 census, in the top 25 wards in England and Wales - while the ward's resort heritage means that it makes the top 50 wards in England and Wales for private renting, with over half of the ward's households rented in that way.

This normally adds up to a Labour-voting ward, although in 2003 its two seats split between Labour and the Conservatives, whose lead candidate Colin Kiddell defeated the second Labour candidate by one vote.  Kiddell was forced to resign within months over accusations that he had stolen and emblezzled funds from a campaign to reopen Dreamland and save the Scenic Railway, and Labour easily gained his former seat in the resulting by-election.  And that was that for excitement in the ward's elections until 2015, when UKIP had a good go at trying to get Nigel Farage into parliament; he didn't win South Thanet (which is based on Ramsgate and Sandwich; this ward is in the North Thanet constituency) but UKIP had the consolation prize of winning 33 of Thanet council's 56 seats and overall control.  One of those UKIP seats came from Margate Central ward, which split its votes 33% to Labour, 31% for UKIP and 20% for the Conservatives; further down the ballot was one of the few local election candidates nominated by the Reality Party, a left-wing group associated with Bez from the Happy Mondays, which polled 3% and failed to make an impact.  The new UKIP district councillor was Jeffrey Elenor, a retired civil servant who had been elected to Kent county council two years previously (from Margate West division).

Since then it's been a rollercoaster ride for UKIP in Thanet's local elections.  UKIP's council groups have not been noted for such boring things as cohesion and internal discipline, and the fact that they are supposed to be running the council has made not a jot of difference to that in Thanet.  In two short years the party has lost its majority due to defections (including their councillor for this ward, Jeffrey Elenor), got it back again in by-elections, and then lost it again through further defections.  Combine that with the UKIP wipeout in 2017's Kent county council election, in which the party fell to a poor third in the Margate division which was narrowly won by Labour with the Tories in second, and the long-term prospects for the Kippers look poor.  The party are now down to 27 seats on Thanet council and will be in a minority if they fail to hold this by-election.

Defending for UKIP is Liz Plewis.  Labour have selected Ian Venables, who has worked in public health in Margate for 25 years.  The Conservative candidate is Reece Pugh, a Commons caseworker and recent University of Kent graduate.  Completing the ballot paper are Bernard Kirkham for the Greens, independent candidates Dean McCastree and Pip Rees, and Lib Dem John Finnegan.
