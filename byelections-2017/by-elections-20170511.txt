So, the ordinary local elections are now over.  With the general election just four weeks away now, the locals have helped to clarify where the battleground is: promising targets now seem like lost causes, while seats which may have seemed out of reach have been brought into play.  More evidence on this front is always helpful, and although both of this week's by-elections are in safe Conservative constituencies both of them are in three-way marginal wards where UKIP polled well last time out.

<h2>WOODVILLE</h2>

South Derbyshire council; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Gill Farrington at the age of 74.  She had served since 2015 as district councillor for this ward, and before then was county councillor for Swadlincote Central and Woodville division from 2009 to 2013, and district councillor for Midway ward from 2007 to 2011.  Farrington was a campaigner for the elderly, establishing a meals-on-wheels service for Swadlincote and chairing the South Derbyshire Forum.

For our key marginal by-election today we are in the heart of England, on the Derbyshire-Leicestershire border.  Woodville grew up around a tollbooth just east of Swadlincote on what is now the A511 Burton-Leicester road, and the village was originally named after the tollbooth, bearing the name "Wooden Box" until the mid-nineteenth century.  "Woodville" as a name dates from 1845 when the foundation stone for the Norman revival St Stephen's church was laid.  One of St Stephen's later vicars was Arnold Hurt, a rather strict father who wouldn't let his young son see films in the cinema opposite the vicarage; despite this, John Hurt became one of England's finest actors.  

When young John was living in Woodville it was an industrial village specialising in pottery and pipe-making: the Mount Pleasant Pipeworks produced the majority of the UK's gas fire radiants during the mid-twentieth century.  The pipeworks are gone now, with a housing estate occupying the site, and Woodville has become a suburb of Swadlincote with a skilled working-class demographic and high employment rates.

Politically Woodville ward has been trending to the Conservatives over the last decade, a process accelerated by boundary changes in 2011 which added to the ward the village of Hartshorne and a third councillor. The 2011 election returned two Labour councillors and one Conservative; in 2015 the Conservatives topped the poll but took only one seat off Labour.  The shares of the vote in 2015 were important: the Tory and Labour slates had 33% each with 27% for the UKIP slate, and with UKIP crashing in the opinion polls and last week's county elections this by-election will be an important indicator of where their working-class vote is going to.  Certainly last week's county elections suggest the momentum is with the Conservatives: they gained overall control of Derbyshire county council last week and Swadlincote Central, a previously safe Labour division which covers Woodville proper, was one of the seats to fall.  Hartshorne lies within the Melbourn county division, which is safely Conservative.

Despite having brought the electors of Woodville out to the polls for the second time in as many weeks (confusion over the electoral timetable seems to be responsible for this), the Conservatives should therefore have cause to feel confident about this defence.  Their defending candidate is Raymond Tipping, one of three Woodville parish councillors on the ballot.  Labour have selected the parish council chairman Malc Lee.  UKIP's Mike Dawson will be hoping for a better performance than the 12% he put in in Swadlincote Central division last week, although in that election he did beat the Lib Dems' Rebecca Wilkinson who completes the ballot paper for this by-election.

<h2>FAIRSTEAD</h2>

King's Lynn and West Norfolk council; caused by the death of Labour councillor Ian Gourlay at the age of 67.  He had represented Fairstead ward since 2003 and since 2016 had been deputy leader of the Labour group on King's Lynn and West Norfolk council

For our second by-election of the week we are on the eastern edge of King's Lynn.  Despite the distance of King's Lynn from the capital, Fairstead was developed from the 1960s onwards as a London overspill estate, and its Wikipedia entry states that Fairstead's development started a second industrial revolution in King's Lynn.  Fifty years on, the ward's census figures suggest that demographic change has been at work: although social renting (30.2% of households) remains high, 8.2% of residents were born in the new EU states; full-time employment in the ward is high (44.9%) and 23.4% of the workforce are in jobs classified as "semi-routine", a figure in the top 100 wards in England and Wales.

This adds up to a safe Labour ward which Ian Gourlay and his ward colleague Margaret Wilkinson had held for Labour relatively comfortably since it was created in 2003, although the Tories came within seven points of winning in the 2007 election.  In 2015 the ward became marginal again with the intervention of UKIP: the Labour slate won with 39% to 31% for the single UKIP candidate and 30% for the Conservative slate.  Like Woodville ward above, Fairstead is in a county council division (Gaywood South) which has seesawed between Labour and the Conservatives in recent elections and was a Tory gain last week.

Defending for Labour is Gary Howman, a former borough councillor for Old Gaywood ward (2011-15).  UKIP's Michael Stone is hoping for better than the 10% he got last week in Gaywood South in the county elections.  The Conservatives have re-selected Ronald Mortimer, an Army veteran who served in Aden and Northern Ireland; he fought this ward in 2015.  Completing the ballot paper is the ward's first Lib Dem candidate this century, Rob Colwell.
