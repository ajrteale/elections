"All the right votes, but not necessarily in the right order"

Before we start this week, a correction is in order.  Two weeks ago in the preview for Milton Regis ward, Swale district, I stated that Liberal Democrat councillor Mark Baldock, who represented the ward from 2002 to 2003, had later become a Labour figure and was elected as a UKIP member of Swale council in 2015.  In fact the former Labour figure turned UKIP Swale councillor is not Mark Baldock but Mike Baldock.  I apologise to both Mark and Mike for the error.

PARK

Peterborough council, Cambridgeshire; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor John Shearman.  A retired headteacher, he had served since 2011; in 2016 he was cautioned by police following an altercation with a Conservative councillor at a council meeting.  Shearman is resigning from the council to concentrate on caring for his wife, who has dementia.

For our city by-election this week we are in Peterborough.  Park ward lies immediately to the north of the city centre, running from the King's School (venue for the UK leg of the World Quizzing Championships in 2010) northwards to Central Park and the Peterborough Regional College.  This is a residential area which has seen much demographic change in recent years, because it has been a focus for immigration.  At the 2011 census 18% of the population of Peterborough Park ward were born in the new EU states, the eighth-highest figure of any ward in England and Wales; in consequence the White Other population (23%) is also very high.  However, the White Other ethnic group is outnumbered by the Asian ethnic group who form 30% of the population; most of those are Muslim.  In consequence of these private renting is high and the ward's age profile is young.

That demographic change has turned the ward's election results on its head.  Park ward, whose boundaries have survived successive boundary reviews to be unchanged since 1997 and only little changed since 1976, had previously been a safe Conservative ward under normal circumstances: although the Alliance did well here in the mid-1980s, Labour had only won the ward once at the Tory nadir of 1995, and then needed help from a split in the Conservative vote caused by an Independent Conservative candidate standing.  As recently as 2008 Labour polled under 11% of the vote and finished in third place behind the Greens.  That changed in 2011 when Labour's John Shearman gained the ward from the Conservatives, polling 51% - a startling swing of 35% in just three years.  Labour gained a second seat in the ward in 2014; the 2016 election, in which all three seats were up, resulted in no change to the party balance with Labour beating the Conservatives 40-38 in votes and 2-1 in seats.  There were no local elections in Peterborough this May, but in June Labour gained the city's parliamentary seat and a council by-election in East ward, suggesting that their Peterborough machine is in good working order.  It needs to be as this by-election is crucial for control of the city council: the ruling Conservative group and the opposition groups both hold 29 seats (plus a vacancy each), so a Labour loss in this by-election will give the Tories overall control of Peterborough council.

Both Labour and the Conservatives have selected Asian candidates.  Defending for Labour is Shaz Nawaz, a chartered accountant who fought the hopeless Dogsthorpe ward in 2016.  The Conservatives have reselected Arfan Khan who was runner-up here in the 2016 election.  Completing the ballot paper are Carolyn English for the Green Party, Graham Whitehead for UKIP and Ian Hardman for the Lib Dems.

ST MARY'S

Forest Heath council, Suffolk; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Bill Sadler at the age of 81.

Described as a constant and often controversial figure in local politics, Sadler started his local government career on the old Newmarket urban district council, serving as the UDC's last chairman in 1973-74.  He was first elected to Forest Heath council in 1976 as an independent candidate, serving as the council chairman in 1980-81, but lost his seat in 1983 after having supported the introduction of car parking charges in Newmarket.  Sadler returned to the council in a 1998 by-election for St Mary's ward, lost his seat again in 2007 but returned in 2011.  He had also served on Suffolk county council, and had come under fire last year: both for editing the Newmarket Messenger, a magazine part-funded by Newmarket town council which he also sat on, and for nominating opposition candidates in a town council by-election which got him kicked out of the Conservative party.  Away from the council he was a Yorkshire-born civil engineer, who designed the town's Houldsworth Valley housing estate where he lived, chairman of the Newmarket branch of the British Legion and a founder member of the Newmarket Town Band.

St Mary's is the most common ward name in the UK, reflecting the number of churches which have been dedicated to the Virgin (or Magdalene) over the years.  This particular St Mary's ward is in Suffolk's most westerly town, Newmarket, covering the western end of the town between the road to Cambridge and the road to Exning.  That can only mean one thing: horse-racing, and this ward includes the Suffolk half of Newmarket racecourse (which spills over the county boundary into Cambridgeshire.  Two of the UK's classic flat races - the 2,000 Guineas and the 1,000 Guineas - are raced here each May, and the town's entire economy is based around the gee-gees, whether it's horse trading, training, breeding, competition, veterinary, historical or related services.  Even the town's MP, Matt Hancock, took part in the 2016 running of the Newmarket Town Plate, reportedly finishing in second place.  As one of the most important global centres of the racehorse business, Newmarket is one of the UK's most important export centres and St Mary's ward has high employment levels.

Newmarket has a complicated administrative history, having originally been split between Cambridgeshire and Suffolk who have playing tug-of-war over the town ever since.  The 1970s local government reorganisation had originally proposed giving Cambridgeshire custody of the town, but lobbying by Suffolk led to Newmarket between transferred back to Suffolk at a late stage.  This led to, as well as a very strange-looking border, the town becoming the largest settlement in the tiny Forest Heath district, whose council chamber is based in Mildenhall.  Forest Heath shares its website and much of its administration with the neighbouring St Edmundsbury district, and it wouldn't be too surprising if a merger between the two councils was sought in the future.

Newmarket's St Mary's ward has had some complicated election results, too.  In 2003 - the first election on the current boundaries - the ward's three seats split two to the Conservatives and one to the West Suffolk Independent Alliance, who topped the poll.  The Conservatives lost a seat (Sadler's seat) to an independent candidate in 2007, but were back to two seats in 2011 - the other seat going to Labour.  In the 2015 election the Tories got a full slate for the first time this century, but on a close three-way result: vote shares were 39% for the Conservative slate, 32% for Labour and 28% for UKIP.  The Tories had a larger majority in May's county elections for the local division (Exning and Newmarket).

Defending for the Tories is Robert Nobbs, a hotel manager who won a by-election to Newmarket Town Council from this ward in May.  The Labour candidate is Michael Jefferys, a long-serving town councillor, twice Mayor of Newmarket and district councillor for this ward from 2011 to 2015; Jeffreys is also straight back on the campaign trail having fought the local county council seat in May and West Suffolk (for the fifth time) in June's general election.  There is no UKIP candidate so Alice Haylock of the Green Party completes the ballot paper.
