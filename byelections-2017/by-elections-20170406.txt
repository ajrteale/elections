After a week's holiday, Andrew's Previews is back to life with four by-elections on 6th April to start your new tax year.  With Article 50 triggered and UKIP's mission apparently accomplished, polling suggests that the prospects for the Brexit party look gloomy ahead of May's county council elections, in which a large number of Kipper councillors in England will be up for re-election.  (UKIP have never elected a councillor in Scotland; they won two council seats in Wales in 2012, but one of those councillors has since died and the other has left the party.)  The fact that the party has annoyed its only MP, Douglas Carswell, to such an extent that he has decided to go it alone does not bode well - the experience of the 2010 Ulster Unionists is not something UKIP will presumably wish to repeat.  This week is a chance for the Kippers to try and turn things around as they defend two seats, one in Carswell's constituency; also up this week are a Lib Dem defence in Bath and a Tory defence in West Yorkshire.  Read on...

<h2>ST JAMES</h2>
Tendring council, Essex; caused by the death of councillor John Hughes at the age of 73.  He was a long-serving councillor having first been elected for St James ward for the Conseratives in a by-election in July 1997; he lost his seat in 2003, standing for re-election as an independent, returned to the council in 2007 from Alton Park ward, lost his seat to Labour in 2011, returned to St James ward in 2015 as a UKIP candidate but at the time of his death was sitting in the council's Coastal Independents group.  Since 2016 he had been a cabinet member on Tendring council, with responsibility for corporate services.

The St James ward is the western end of the Clacton-on-Sea seafront, on what the Essex tourist board rather hopefully describe as the "Essex Sunshine Coast".  Maybe that was the experience of the trippers to Billy Butlin's holiday camp, located in this ward until it closed down in 1983 and since redeveloped for housing.  Clacton has an old history - archaeological work in the area has identified 400,000-year-old flint tools manufactured by <em>Homo erectus</em> hominids.  The modern population of Clacton is also old - in St James ward 34% of the population is aged over 64 and 27% of the workforce are retired - and it says something that the last by-election in this ward, in September 2013, was caused by the death of a councillor at the age of 87.  For those who are still young enough to work, the ward's economic profile is working-class and low-paid.

Clacton's election results over the last three years have dominated by the saga of Douglas Carswell and his short-lived UKIP membership.  From nowhere in 2011 Carswell got 22 councillors elected under his colours to Tendring council in 2015, making UKIP the second-largest party one seat behind the Conservatives.  Analysing large UKIP groups in local government has often brought to mind the old joke about the formation of a new nonconformist denomination - item one on the agenda: the split - but in Tendring's case that joke actually happened thanks to an inspired move by the Tory group, who offered UKIP a coalition deal to run the council.  True to form, Tendring UKIP immediately split over whether to accept it, with Hughes - who had served in Tory cabinets in the past - on the pro side and having to leave the party for his efforts.  Several more defections and less than two years later, only 11 of the 23 Tendring Kippers - including Carswell - elected in 2015 are still in the party.  At the last count there were 13 UKIP councillors in Tendring to 27 Conservatives, 8 independents (plus this vacancy), 5 Labour, 3 Holland-on-Sea Residents Association, 1 English Democrat (who was elected as UKIP) and 1 Tendring First.

So this is an early electoral test for the damaged UKIP machine as they enter a brave new Carswell-less world.  In 2015 they had 39% of the vote to 35% for the Conservatives - who held the other seat in the ward - and 16% for Labour.  The Tories hold the local Clacton West county division - which extends outside the town to include the notorious shanty town of Jaywick, the most deprived part of England according to official statistics - and in next month's county council elections will defend a 7-point lead over UKIP.

Defending this interesting by-election for UKIP is Teresa O'Hara, who was the unsuccessful UKIP candidate in this ward in 2015.  The Tories have also selected their unsuccessful candidate from 2015, Maurice Alexander.  The Labour candidate is Wendy Brown, a consultant in HR and employment law.  Completing the ballot paper are Rosemary Dodds for the Green Party and Sean Duffy for the Lib Dems.

<h2>ELMHURST</h2>
Aylsbury Vale council, Buckinghamshire; caused by the resignation of UK Independence Party councillor Andy Hetherington who has moved away from the area.  He had served since 2015.

For our second UKIP defence of the week we are in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire's county town.  Elmhurst is the northern ward of Aylesbury, lying in between the A413 road to Buckingham and the A418 to Leighton Buzzard.  Like in many towns, the housing gets newer the further out you go, with Victorian and Edwardian terraces near the centre turning into seventies and eighties estates around Elmhurst Road - part of Aylesbury's ring road.  

Boundary changes confuse the issue slightly as the present ward dates only from 2015, when the three-member Elmhurst and Watermead ward was split up with Watermead - a 1980s and 1990s estate to the north outside the Aylesbury parish boundary - removed to a rural ward of its own.  In the 2011 census the former Elmhurst and Watermead ward returned unusually racially diverse figures for a ward in a shire county - 18% Asian, 3.7% mixed race, 14% Muslim - and had high levels of full-time employment (46% of the workforce), a very interesting mix.  This produced a chaotic result in Elmhurst ward in the 2015 election, with the Lib Dem slate topping the poll on 26% and winning one seat, UKIP polling 23% and winning the other seat, Labour scoring 22% and the Conservatives fourth on 21%.  The local county division, Aylesbury North, was a Lib Dem-UKIP marginal - if you can get your head around such a prospect - in the 2013 county elections, and the Lib Dems are defending an eight-point lead in that division in May.  There are no implications for control of Aylesbury Vale council, where the Conservatives have a large majority (42 seats plus one vacancy to 8 Lib Dems, 3 UKIP plus this vacancy, 2 Labour and 2 Independents).

With that four-way marginal result in 2015 very little can be confidently predicted about this by-election save that all four of those parties will feel that they have a genuine chance of victory.  The defending UKIP candidate is Phil Gomm, a DJ who gives an address nearly ten miles away in the village of Granborough; he is county councillor for Aylesbury East division, and fought Bedgrove ward (in his division) as an independent in the 2015 election after falling out with UKIP, but would appear to be back in the fold.  The Lib Dem candidate is Susan Morgan, an Aylesbury town councillor for most of the ward.  Labour have selected Gary Paxton, who stood here in 2015.  Another returning candidate from 2015 is Ammer Raheel of the Conservatives, a shop assistant and director of a car hire company.  Completing the ballot paper is Nigel Foster of the Green Party.
