Three by-elections on 27th July 2017:

<h2>BLANDFORD CENTRAL</h2>

North Dorset council; caused by the death of independent councillor Esme Butler at the age of 61.  Four times Mayor of Blandford Forum, Butler was frst elected to the district council in 2011 for Blandford Damory Down ward, transferring to Blandford Central ward after boundary changes in 2015.

Welcome to Blandford Forum, an attractive Dorset town on the River Stour noted for its Georgian town centre, rebuilt by local architects John and William Bastard following a disastrous fire in 1731, and described in 1970 as the most complete and cohesive suriving example of a Georgian country town in England.  Blandford has been a service centre for the local area for centuries; it was a market town by the thirteen century and had traditional industries including lacemaking, button-making and brewing.  Brewing remains important to the local economy - Hall and Woodhouse's Badger brewery is based here - but the traditional textile industries have declined and been replaced by administration (North Dorset district council is based in the town), services and the Army: the Royal Corps of Signals, who are responsible for the Army's telecommunications, are based in Blandford.  Blandford also gives its name to an insect: the Blandford fly (<em>Simulium posticatum</em>), a particularly nasty type of biting blackfly which is endemic to the area.

Blandford's Central ward is rather misleadingly named, in that while it is the centre of the town's built-up area it does not cover the Georgian town centre, which is by the riverside at the southern end of the town.  The present Central ward was created in 2015 as a merger of the former Damory Down and Station wards; in the 2011 census Damory Down, a mostly 1970s development on the north-western edge of town, made the top 80 wards in England and Wales for part-time work (18.4% of the workforce), while Station ward - covering older housing along the Salisbury Road and named after a railway station which was a casualty of Beeching - had less remarkable demographics.

The Liberal Democrats have had a significant vote in Blandford for many years and won all five of the town's district council seats in 2007.  The 2011 election was less successful for the Lib Dems who lost Hilltop ward to the Conservatives and Damory Down ward to independent Esme Butler.  In the 2015 election to the new central ward Butler stood for election without opposition from the Lib Dems, who ran only their outgoing Station ward councillor John Tanner; shares of the vote were 30% for Butler, 27% for the Lib Dem candidate, 20% for the Tory slate and 12% for the Green candidate.  In the Dorset county elections in May Blandford Forum division was a narrow Conservative gain from the Liberal Democrats.

With no defending independent candidate Butler's seat is up for grabs in Britain Elects' favourite type of by-election - a free-for-all.  The Liberal Democrats, from whom Butler gained her seat in 2011, have selected Hugo Mieville; a Blandford Forum town councillor and the Lib Dem parliamentary candidate for North Dorset in 2015, Mieville teaches French and Spanish at the independent Milton Abbey school.  The Tory candidate is Noc Lacey-Clarke, a town councillor who runs a gamers' shop (Nocs Box).  There is no Green candidate so the ballot paper is completed by Labour's Haydn White.
