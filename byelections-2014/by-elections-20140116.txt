Just the one by-election this week...

BROADHEATH, Trafford metropolitan borough council, Greater Manchester; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Ken Weston.  A Trafford councillor since 2000, Weston had served as Mayor of Trafford in 2010/11.

Altringham, as it's pronounced.  The Broadheath ward is essentially the north-western corner of Altrincham, a residential and industrial area along the A56 Manchester Road and the Bridgewater Canal.  The ward is essentially everything in Altrincham north-west of the canal, together with the area around Deansgate Lane on the other side of the canal, plus a small part of Sale.  Greater Manchester residents of a certain age may recall trying to keep their balance on the Altrincham Ice Rink, which was located within this ward.

Although there is some Manchester commuting (Timperley tram stop lies on the eastern boundary of the ward), the presence of the largish industrial area means that this is Labour's best of the seven wards in Altrincham, and since the formation of the Coalition the ward has turned from a safe Tory area into a key marginal.  Ken Weston was rather lucky to be re-elected in 2011 with 43% to 40% for Labour (a majority of 122 votes), and Labour built on that good showing to gain the ward at the 2012 election by 46% to 39% for the Conservatives (265 votes).

Trafford council is one of only two Tory-controlled metropolitan boroughs (the other is Solihull) and their majority is tenuous enough that there is a good chance of no overall control, perhaps even Labour becoming the largest party, following the forthcoming May 2014 election.  A Labour gain in this by-election would make such a scenario that bit more likely, so this is an unusually crucial by-election.  

Defending for the Tories is the long-serving councillor who lost her seat to Labour in 2012, local resident Brenda Houraghan.  Labour have selected secondary school maths teacher Helen Boyle, a Sale resident.  UKIP, who took third place off the Lib Dems in 2012, have nominated Ron George, who gives an address in Partington; the Green Party candidate is Joe Ryan from Sale; and Stretford-based Will Jones stands for the Lib Dems.
