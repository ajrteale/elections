DARWELL, Rother district council, East Sussex; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Bob White for health reasons.

The Darwell ward is a large tract of rural East Sussex, located in the hills of the Sussex Weald to the north-west of Battle.  There is no village called Darwell; rather, the ward is named after the Darwell Wood site of special scientific interest, which surrounds the Darwell Reservoir that provides much of the area's drinking water.  The largest village within the ward (providing around 1,450 electors) is Burwash, probably best known as the home of Rudyard Kipling who set Puck of Pook's Hill in the area.

Darwell ward returns two members to Rother district council, and in the 2003 and 2007 elections they were David Vereker of the Conservatives and independent candidate Wendy Miers, who was not opposed by the Tories.  Miers stood down in 2011 and Bob White - who was elected for the neighbouring Battle Town ward as a Lib Dem in 2003 but lost his seat as a Conservative in 2007 - was elected in her place.  At county level the ward is split between the safe Tory division of Rother North West and the safe Lib Dem division of Battle and Crowhurst; however, the Lib Dem strength in Battle and Crowhurst comes from Battle town which is not part of this ward.

Defending for the Tories is Eleanor Kirby-Green, who lives outside the ward in Ticehurst.  Andrew Wedmore of the Green Party, the runner-up in the 2011 district election, tries his luck again; he lives within the ward at Brightling.  The Lib Dems have reselected Tracy Dixon, who also lives within the ward (at Netherfield), while Labour's candidate is Suz Evasdaughter, a B&B owner with an interest in raw food.  Completing the ballot paper is UKIP's Edward Smith, from Burwash.

THURMASTON, Charnwood borough council, Leicestershire; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Paul Harley due to work commitments.  Harley had been a Charnwood councillor for eleven years and had served on the council's cabinet.

Thurmaston is a Leicester suburb, located just outside the city limits.  It can be found to the north-east of the city on the Fosse Way, on the eastern bank of the River Soar.

Although Thurmaston forms part of a safe Conservative parliamentary seat, it is a key marginal ward in the current political climate.  The ward's three seats split two Tory and one Labour in 2003.  The Tories then won the 2005 county council election with Harley as their candidate.  The 2007 district election and 2009 county election were convincing Conservative wins, but the 2011 district election was a much closer-run affair: the Tories held all three seats but with majorities over Labour of just 167, 93 and 3 votes.  Labour followed up on this good performance by gaining the county council seat from Paul Harley last year by a majority of 123 votes.

Defending for the Conservatives is Hanif Asmal, a teacher, Syston parish councillor and chairman of the Charnwood Conservative Association.  The Labour challenge is led by Thurmaston parish councillor Ralph Raven, who is the only candidate to live within the ward.  Charnwood is one of only two local councils to still have a BNP member, and the BNP polled 24% here at the 2007 district election; this time the far-right vote is disputed between Stephen Denham of the BNP and Chris Canham of the British Democrats, a BNP splinter group associated with former MEP Andrew Brons.  Tom Prior, Thurmaston's first UKIP candidate, comples the ballot paper.

MOSTYN, Flintshire county council; caused by the disqualification of independent councillor Patrick Heesom, for reasons which will be outlined below.

Viewers of the Open Championship at Hoylake last weekend may have noticed some TV shots over the Dee estuary to the North Wales coastline.  On that coastline is the small port of Mostyn.  
This was once a ferry port with regular passenger services to Dublin, but since that service ended ten years ago the port has specialised in industrial applications; the wings for new Airbus A380 aircraft are transferred to a France-bound ship here after being floated down the estuary from the Airbus factory in Broughton, while the port has also been a construction base for the windfarms which have been constructed in the Irish Sea over the last decade.  Apart from the port, the coastal strip is mainly occupied by industry (there is also a large bleach factory here, and a plan for an incinerator which has produced a predictably negative response from locals), the North Wales Coast main line and the A548 coastal road, with most of the population living up on the hillside in the villages of Mostyn and Maes Pennant.  Another maritime connection to the division is the former "fun ship" Duke of Lancaster, now laid up in dry dock at Llannerch-y-Mor at the southern end  of the division.  The fun ship's owners closed the ship (which had been used as a bar and arcade) in 2004 after having had enough of repeated long-running legal attacks from the local council.  

Long-running legal cases involving the local council seems to be a theme when you examine the circumstances of Patrick Heesom's disqualification.  The original complaint was made in 2009, and the Adjudication Panel for Wales - the relevant tribunal - found that Heesom had bullied, harassed and intimidated three council officers.  The disqualification was made in July 2013 for a period of two-and-a-half years, but the by-election couldn't be held before now because Heesom appealed to the High Court to try to get the decision overturned.  The High Court upheld the Panel's decision but did reduce his suspension to eighteen months.  The extended legal process means that this seat has now been vacant for more than a year.

Heesom had represented Mostyn since 1996, was a former leader of Flintshire council's independent group, and was last re-elected in 2012 - after the bullying and harassment claims became public knowledge - by a 2-to-1 margin over Labour.  All previous contests in the division this century have been straight fights between Heesom and Labour, so there is little information that can be gleaned from previous election results.

With Heesom now definitely out of the picture we can finally get the by-election underway.  David Roney is the new independent candidate; he is a Mostyn community councillor and spokesman for the anti-incinerator campaign group.  The Labour candidate is Pam Banks, from Ffynnongroyw just up the coast.  Also standing are Richard Pendlebury, a software engineer from Flint, for the Conservatives, and building manager Liz Soutter who is the UKIP candidate.

PENYDARREN, Merthyr Tydfil county borough council; caused by the death of UKIP councillor Neil 'Jock' Greer at the age of 66.  Greer had been a Merthyr councillor since 2008, originally being elected as an independent before joining UKIP in 2009.

This tract of housing in the north-east of Merthyr Tydfil has an interesting history.  There was a first-century Roman fort at Penydarren, but the division itself is famous for the Penydarren Ironworks, one of the factories which made Merthyr into a powerhouse of the Industrial Revolution.  Always ready to try new ideas, the ironworks' owner commissioned Richard Trevithick to build what became one of the world's first steam loomotives; in 1804 "Penydarren" successfully hauled ten tons of iron almost ten miles to Abercynon.  Penydarren House, the home of the ironworks' owners, was the main Government stronghold during the Merthyr Rising.  The works started to redeveloped for housing in the late nineteenth century and Penydarren became Merthyr's "premier middle-class suburb", if it is possible for such a thing to exist in one of the UK's most depressed post-industrial towns.

Nonetheless it is possible to see this middle-class heritage in Penydarren's election results.  Labour have a lock on parliamentary elections in Merthyr, but this dominance doesn't necessarily translate to the local level in which there is a large amount of support for independent candidates; at Labour's low point in 2008 they held just eight of the 33 seats on Merthyr council and topped the poll in only one of the town's eleven divisions.  In 2004 Penydarren returned two independents and one councillor from the now-defunct group People Before Politics, one of whose unsuccessful candidates was Neil Greer.  Greer won election in 2008 as an independent candidate, as stated, with all three seats in that election going to independents.  At the most recent election in 2012 one of the independent councillors (Christopher Davies) stood down, Allan 'Salty' Jones stood for re-election and topped the poll, and Greer was re-elected under his new UKIP colours; Labour gained the division's third seat.

There is no new UKIP candidate to defend Greer's seat, which is therefore up for grabs.  There are two independent candidates on the ballot paper: Clive Barsi was elected as the People Before Politics councillor here in 2004, lost his seat in 2008 and tried unsuccessfully to get it back in 2012, while Kerry Baker Thomas is involved with a local autism support group.  Labour have selected John McCarthy who fought the division in 2012.  The Lib Dems and Tories have also found candidates; they are Robert Griffin and Kimberley Murphy respectively.
