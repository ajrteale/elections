Apologies from your columnist for the lack of coverage of last week's by-elections in Newark (Conservative hold) and Clydesdale South (Labour gain from SNP).  We hope to return to normal by covering three by-elections on 12th June 2014, which are all independent defences.

COLLINGTON, Rother district council, East Sussex; caused by the resignation of Independent councillor John Lee for personal reasons.

The Collington ward can be found in the south coast town of Bexhill-on-Sea, and effectively covers the western end of the town's seafront around Collington railway station, which lies on the Hastings-Eastbourne line.  Fiction has portrayed Bexhill as some sort of nightmarish place; in the 2006 film Children of Men it was a refugee camp for immigrants, and even Spike Milligan's memoirs depict a wartime Bexhill which Milligan's company had the task of defending without any ammunition for their big guns (training on the big guns involved much shouting of the word BANG).  The truth is very different, with the town being a ghetto not for quarantined refugees but for pensioners, who retire here from London to be near the seaside.  This ambience has also attracted more than a fair share of celebrities to the town, and reportedly both Fanny Cradock and Graham Norton live or have lived in the ward.

The Conservatives had a lock on this ward throughout the Noughties, with only a single Lib Dem providing opposition to the Tory slate in 2003 and 2007 and the Tories crushing the Lib Dems and Labour in a June 2008 by-election.  But things changed in 2011 when an independent slate took both seats in the ward, and last year UKIP gained one of the Conservative seats in the county division covering the ward.  That suggests that this by-election could be very unpredictable.

The new independent candidate is Douglas Oliver.  Gillian Wheeler, the winner of the 2008 by-election who lost her seat in 2011, stands for the Conservatives.  Alan Bearne is Labour's paper candidate, and UKIP's Philip Moore completes the ballot paper.

SLEAFORD QUARRINGTON AND MAREHAM, and SLEAFORD WESTHOLME, North Kesteven district council, Lincolnshire; caused by the resignations of Independent councillors Ian Dolby and Brian Watson respectively.  Dolby has resigned ostensibly to spend more time on his accountancy firm, although he has also been a controversial figure; last year a judge ordered him to repay over £3,000 which he had withheld from a business client, and he was arrested in December 2013 on suspicion of possessing indecent images of children (he is currently on bail).  Watson, a former Labour councillor who has served on North Kesteven district council since winning a by-election in 1996 and was Mayor of Sleaford in 2013/4, is suffering from poor health.

One of the fen towns in which southern Lincolnshire specialises, Sleaford goes back to Roman times, and became a major agricultural centre in the eighteenth century with the canalising of the River Slea to create the Sleaford Navigation.  The railways came here in 1857, and Sleaford is still a railway junction, with lines from Peterborough to Lincoln and from Grantham to Skegness meeting here.  Hubbard's seeds and Bass maltings were major employers, as was administration; from 1888 to 1974 Sleaford was the county town of the Parts of Kesteven.  

The town is covered by five wards.  Sleaford Quarrington and Mareham is a three-member ward covering the town's southern fringe, while Sleaford Westholme is a single-member ward covering a small part of the north-west of the town.  

Quarrington and Mareham ward was introduced in boundary changes for the 2007 election and is the successor to the former single-member wards of Sleaford Mareham (which was Lib Dem in 2003) and Sleaford Quarrington (which voted Conservative that year).  The Conservatives won all three seats at the inaugural 2007 election but lost one of them to Dolby in 2011.

Sleaford Westholme ward has returned Watson at every election this century with steadily increasing majorities; in 2003 he was returned as a Labour councillor under slightly different boundaries.

Westholme ward is primarily part of the Sleaford county division, which in a highly fragmented result in 2013 saw the well-organised Lincolnshire Independents county council group top the poll with less than 28% of the vote, gaining the seat from the Conservatives who were second with 22%.  A small fringe of the Westholme ward, and half of the Quarrington and Mareham ward, is part of the Sleaford West and Leasingham county division in which the Tories comfortably held off UKIP last year.

The new independent candidate in Quarrington and Mareham ward is Nigel Gresham, who runs a printing and sign-writing company; although he has recently spent a year in prison for killing four of his children by dangerous driving, he is the chairman of the committee which successfully revived the Sleaford Carnival last year.  The Conservative candidate is Gary Titmus, who unsuccessfully fought this ward in the 2011 district elections and Sleaford in the 2013 county elections.  Also standing is Mark Suffield for the Lincolnshire Independents, fresh from winning a by-election to Sleaford town council in September last year.

In Westholme ward there is no independent candidate to succeed Watson, although there is another Lincolnshire Independents candidate, kiosk owner Steve Fields.  The Tories are standing Andrew Rayner, who runs an internet marketing company, and the Labour candidate is Robert Greetham, who stood in the 2011 district elections (for Kirkby la Thorpe and South Kyme ward) as a Lib Dem candidate.
