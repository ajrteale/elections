There are twelve by-elections on 27th November.  Nine will be covered in English Elections and three in Scottish Elections.  In Scotland there is a poll to the non-partisan Orkney islands council, while the SNP have chances to take a seat in northern Aberdeenshire off the Tories and a seat in Midlothian from Labour.  In England, Labour have three very safe seats to defend in one of the most notorious housing estates in Oxfordshire.  There are some interesting marginal wards up for election in rural Leicestershire and urban Middlesex, and a safe Tory defence in Huntingdonshire.   But we start in the East Riding with three by-elections: the Tories are defending two and the other seat is vacated by a party which you might have thought was long dead...


BRIDLINGTON CENTRAL AND OLD TOWN, HOWDENSHIRE, and WILLERBY AND KIRK ELLA, East Riding council; caused by the deaths, respectively, of continuing SDP councillor Ray Allerston and Conservative councillors Doreen Engall and Angela Ibson.  

Ray Allerston, who has died at the age of 80, is a former farmer and driver whose local government career started in 1987 on the now-abolished East Yorkshire district council; he had also served on Bridlington town council since its inception in 2000 and was Mayor of Bridlington in 2007-8.  Doreen Engall, whose death came at the age of 90, had an even longer local government career, beginning in 1976 on Holme-upon-Spalding Moor parish council; she was twice Mayor of the former Boothferry borough council, had served on the former Humberside county council and was a former chairman of Humberside Fire Authority (twice) and East Riding council.  Engall's long local government career was recognised in the 2013 Birthday Honours in which she was gazetted MBE.  Angela Ibson died at 70 while waiting for heart bypass surgery; she had served on East Riding council since 2007.

One county, three very different wards.  Starting off in Bridlington, the largest town in the East Riding, where the first thing you notice is that the SDP are the defending party.  Do not adjust your calendar.  We are definitely in November 2014; it's just that Bridlington is the last stronghold of the continuing SDP, still going twenty-four years after the second Bootle by-election of 1990 caused the national party to be wound up.  The rather misnamed Central and Old Town ward is nowhere near the seafront, consisting instead of Bridlington's north-west corner (the Old Town area) together with three rural parishes: Boynton, Grimdale, and Bempton on the north coast of Flamborough Head.  Its elections since 2003 have been dominated by Allerston who had a large personal vote, and the other parties often ran short slates in order that he was effectively unopposed; in 2011 the two non-SDP seats were shared by the Tories and Labour, making this ward a rare three-way split.

Howdenshire is a large and very rural ward aross the River Ouse from Goole, containing five railway stations, including the junction at Gilberdyke, and the North Cave junction where the M62 Transpennine motorway runs out of steam several miles short of Hull.  It's traditionally been a safe Tory ward, but a by-election in May 2013 (caused by one of the other Tory councillors becoming deputy police and crime commissioner for Humberside) saw UKIP poll 35% and turn the ward into a Tory/UKIP marginal.

Different yet again is Willerby and Kirk Ella ward, an affluent suburb of Hull which has not yet been annexed by the city.  This was a Tory/Lib Dem marginal during the last Labour administration; the Lib Dems narrowly won all three seats in 2003.  The Tories gained the ward from the Lib Dems in 2007 but then lost a seat in a farcical by-election on general election day in 2010 after messing up their nomination and failing to get on the ballot: the by-election ended up as a straight fight between the Lib Dems and Labour with the Lib Dems winning by 4:1.  The Tories pulled away in 2011 and made the ward safe.

In what may represent the final death of the continuing SDP, they have not nominated a candidate to replace Ray Allerston, so Bridlington Central and Old Town is an open seat.  The Tories have nominated John Copsey, the deputy Mayor of Bridlington.  There is no Labour candidate even though they hold one of the council seats in the ward; however, Liam Dealtry, one of the three independent candidates, was on the Labour slate here in 2011.  The other independents are Terry Dixon, who was Mayor of Bridlington in 2013-14, and Neil Tate, while town councillor Malcolm Milns completes the balot paper for UKIP.

Three candidates have been nominated for Howdenshire: Nigel Wilkinson, a business advisor from Newland near Goole, for the Conservatives; Beverley resident Clive Waddington for UKIP; and Cottingham resident Danny Marten, who fought the parliamentary seat (Haltemprice and Howden) in 2010, for Labour.

Willerby and Kirk Ella is also a three way fight involving the same parties.  Local campaigner Mick Burchill defends for the Tories.  The Lib Dems appear to have thrown in the towel.   Labour's candidate is Daniel Palmer and UKIP's is Robert Skinner.

ASFORDBY, Melton district council, Leicestershire; caused by the death of Labour councillor Trevor Moncrieff at the age of 66.  Moncrieff was in his first term as district councillor for Asfordby, and had served as leader of the Labour group on Melton council.

This ward covers the village of Asfordby, just to the west of Melton Mowbray on the north bank of the River Wreake.  It's a surprisingly industrial village, with a modern deep coal pit having operated here in the 1980s and 1990s, and today it's known for the Old Dalby Test Track; located on the route of the old railway line from Melton to Nottingham, this is a private railway used by London Underground and the UK's train companies for testing new train designs.

The industrial legacy is reflected in the fact that Labour are the best-organised party here, although they lost the ward's two seats in 2007 to a Tory candidate (who was in fact one of the outgoing Labour councillors) and an independent.  Labour regained the Independent seat at the 2011 election, the Tory councillor being re-elected at the top of the poll.  While this ward is most definitely marginal, the wider Asfordby county division (which covers a huge swathe of countryside to the west of Melton) voted 79% Tory in 2013 in a straight fight with Labour, and this gives you a taste of the wider nature of Melton council and the local parliamentary seat (Rutland and Melton).

The defending Labour candidate is Michael Blase, a design engineer from Melton Mowbray.  The Tories, bidding to hold two seats in the ward for the first time this century, have nominated Ronnie de Burle who has lived in Asfordby for 45 years.  Completing the ballot paper is the ward's first UKIP candidate, Sacha Barnes.

BLACKBIRD LEYS and NORTHFIELD BROOK, Oxford city council; and LEYS, Oxfordshire county council; caused by the resignations of Labour councillors Val Smith, who was county councillor for Leys and city councillor for Blackbird Leys, due to ill-health; and Steve Curran, city councillor for Northfield Brook, who has resigned in order to stand for the county council by-election.  Val Smith is the wife of Andrew Smith, the Labour MP for Oxford East.
 
What is going on in Oxford at the moment?  These are the fourth, fifth and sixth council by-elections in the city since July.

The Leys county division can be found at the very south-east corner of Oxford.  It covers the parish of Blackbird Leys, named after the 1950s and 1960s housing estate of the same name which has become notorious for its deprivation and high crime rate.  Newly drawn for the 2013 county elections, Leys division covers two wards of Oxford city council: Blackbird Leys itself, and Northfield Brook, which covers the area to the south-west of the division around the stream of the same name.

During most of the Noughties, this strongly left-wing ward was closely fought between Labour and the Independent Working Class Association, who won one of the two seats in Northfield Brook at the 2002 election.  In 2004 the IWCA held that seat and gained Blackbird Leys ward, and they gained the second seatin Northfield Brook from Labour in 2006; in the interim Labour held by-elections in both wards in 2005.  Labour regained the IWCA seats in 2008 (in Blackbird Leys) and in 2010 and 2012 (in Northfield Brook), and the IWCA now appear to have folded as an electoral force.  In their absence Labour polled 82% of the vote in Leys in the 2013 county election, and in the 2012 city council elections Labour had 85% in Blackbird Leys and 74% in Northfield Brook.  In 2014 Northfield Brook was the safer Labour ward because UKIP fought Blackbird Leys and polled 21%.  Val Smith's resignation gave the ruling Conservatives half the seats on Oxfordshire county council, and in the unlikely event of a Tory gain in the county by-election they will have a majority.  There are no implications for control of Oxford city council, where Labour have a large majority.

The Leys county division is defended, as stated above, by Labour's Steve Curran, who gained Northfield Brook ward from the IWCA in 2012.  He is opposed by Samuel Burgess (C), Ann Duncan (Grn), Lesley Mallinder (LD), James Morbin (Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition) and Dave Slater (UKIP).

Curran leaves behind a city council seat in Northfield Brook which Sian Taylor (Lab), an NHS nurse of 30 years' service, is favourite to win against opposition from Gary Dixon (C), Ann Duncan (Grn), Michael Tait (LD) and James Morbin (TUSC).  In the Blackbird Leys by-election Labour's Linda Smith, the wife of prominent left-wing blogger and former Labour NEC member Luke Akehurst, seeks to return to local government having recently moved to Oxford after twelve years as a Hackney councillor in London; she takes on Dave Slater (UKIP), Berk Bektas (C), Elizabeth McHale (Grn), Lesley Mallinder (LD) and Stella Collier (TUSC).

CHARVILLE, London borough of Hillingdon, North London; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor David Horne due to ill-health.  Horne was a long-serving councillor but had only returned to Hillingdon council in May, having lost his seat for this ward in 2006.

This ward is in suburban northern Hayes, to the north of the Uxbridge Road; it includes the Hayes End and Hillingdon Heath areas, and is named after Charville Lane in the north of the ward.  At the centre of the ward can be found the headquarters of United Biscuits, owner of brands including Jacob's and McVities, which was sold this month to a Turkish company.  United Biscuits' internal radio launched the careers of some well-known DJs including Dale Winton, and indeed Hayes has many links to film and entertainment generally; scenes for the recent horror film World War Z were filmed in this ward.  I hasten to add that the ward is not populated by zombies.

This is a socially divided ward, with Hayes End being more upmarket than the rest of the area; other highlights from the 2011 census show that this was in the top 100 most Sikh wards in England and only just outside the top 100 for Hindus.  The social division comes through in the ward's election results in which this is a crucial Labour/Tory marginal.  Labour won all three seats in 2002; the Tories gained two seats in 2006; the 2010 split remained 1 Labour and 2 Conservative; while Labour (David Horne) knocked one of the Conservatives out by 14 votes in last May's ordinary election to make the split 2 Labour and 1 Conservative.  At the last GLA elections in 2012 Boris beat Ken 50-39 in the ward's ballot boxes, but in the list vote Labour were on top with 42%, to 35% for the Tories and 8% for UKIP.  There does appear to be a populist right-wing vote in the ward; the BNP were in third place here in 2010 and last May UKIP polled 22% of the vote.  With the Kippers riding high in the polls this may be one to watch; there are not many wards in Greater London which are as favourable for them.  There are no implications for control of Hillingdon council, which has a large Conservative majority, while the local parliamentary seat (Hayes and Harlington) is safe for Labour.

Defending for Labour is John Oswell, a former long-serving councillor for Pinkwell ward in Hayes who stood down from the council in 2010; in May he fought the similarly-marginal Yiewsley ward.  The Tories have selected former Mayor of Hillindgon Mary O'Connor, who lost her seat in this ward in May's ordinary election by just 14 votes.  UKIP have reselected their May candidate Cliff Dixon; also the chair of Hillingdon UKIP and PPC for Hayes and Harlington, Dixon atracted some adverse publicity last year over alleged links to the English Defence League.  Also on the ballot are Wally Kennedy for the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition and Paul McKeown for the Lib Dems.

ST NEOTS PRIORY PARK, Huntingdonshire district council, Cambridgeshire; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Paula Longford.

This ward covers the town centre and north-east of St Neots.  Named after St Neots Priory, an early Norman Benedictine foundation, this is a mediaeval town which has grown rapidly since the Second World War thanks to its location on the Great North Road and the East Coast Main Line, which led to the development of London overspill housing in the town.  The population growth is such that St Neots has overtaken Huntingdon to become Cambridgeshire's largest town (as opposed to city, which Cambridge and Peterborough both are).  The Priory Park ward is centred on St Neots railway station, and includes the Love's Farm housing estate to the east of the station.  

The present Priory Park ward was created in 2004, in which year it elected two Conservatives with a comfortable majority over the Lib Dems.  However, the Lib Dems gained the two seats in the ward at the 2006 and 2007 elections, defeating Longford in 2007 by a majority of just 16 votes.  The Lib Dem strentgh then disappeared as suddenly as it had come, and the Tories got their seats back in 2010 and 2011; there was no Lib Dem candidate in May and UKIP took over second place, polling 27% to 48% for the Tories and 15% for Labour.

The defending Tory candidate is town councillor Ian Gardener.  UKIP's Carol Gamby has been reselected after fighting the ward in May, and Labour's Angela Hogan completes the ballot paper.  Whoever wins this by-election will be straight back on the campaign trail, as they will be up for re-election in May.

KIRKWALL WEST AND ORPHIR, Orkney Islands council; caused by the resignation of independent councillor Jack Moodie due to "lack of motivation and enthusiasm".

Up to the remote northern isles.  The Kirkwall West and Orphir ward is a combined rural-urban ward: Orphir is a rural parish at the south-western corner of Orkney Mainland.  The ward has a long coastline on the northern edge of Scapa Flow, and also includes the western half of the Orkney Islands' capital, Kirkwall, including the Balfour Hospital, Orkney's main NHS hospital where most Orcadians begin and end their lives.

Orkney's elections are essentially non-partisan.  Jack Moodie had been elected at the top of the poll at the first STV election in 2007, polling almost twice the quota in this four-seat ward, and had also topped the poll in 2012 with 476 first preference votes (31%).  

There are four candidates competing for Moodie's seat.  First in alphabetical order is Laurence Leonard, who fought the ward in 2012 and came a poor sixth out of eleven candiates with just 42 first preferences; a builder and Kirkwall community councillor, he made the news a few years ago by threatening to kill two police officers with a non-existent nail gun, for which he was sentenced to 18 months' probation.  Lorraine McBrearty is a singer from Kirkwall, who had a Patsy Cline tribute show at this year's Edinburgh Fringe.  Leslie Manson has recently retired after a 37-year career with the council, latterly as a long-serving director of education; he was gazetted MBE in the 2013 New Year Honours for services to Scottish education and the community in Orkney.  Last on the ballot paper is Gillian Skuse, chair of Orkney Health and Care and non-exec director of NHS Orkney.

MIDLOTHIAN EAST, Midlothian council; caused by the resignation of Peter Boyes, who was elected as Labour but had left the party and was sitting as an independent.

This is a slightly awkwardly-shaped division, running southeast from the Sheriffhall roundabout (scene of many a traffic jam on the Edinburgh bypass) around the south of Dalkeith to include several villages along the A68 Edinbugh-Carter Bar road.  The principal settlements in the ward are Eskbank, the southern part of Dalkeith and a traditionally well-helled area; and Mayfield, a 1950s development for colliery workers at Newtongrange and Easthouses; Easthouses also lies within the ward and effetively has merged into Mayfield.

The first proportional representation election here in 2007 was neck-and-neck between the SNP and Labour on first preferences, with the Lib Dems winning the final seat easily thanks to a combination of the SNP only standing one candidate and Labour failing to balance their vote between two candidates.  The Lib Dem councillor then defected to Labour and stood for re-election in 2012 on the Labour slate.  The SNP were clearly ahead on first preferences in 2012 (polling 43% to 36% for Labour) and with no official Lib Dem candidate had a chance of winning two out of three; however, another failure by Labour to balance their candidates saw the second Labour candidate (the ex-Lib Dem) eliminated, and Labour and Conservative transfers elected independent candidate Peter Devink to the final seat with a majority of 19 votes over the second SNP candidate.  With the SNP riding high in the polls they now have an opportunity to take a second seat in the ward for the first time.  Midlothian council is currently run by a coalition of the SNP and Devink which has half the seats, and if the SNP gain this by-election the administration will have a majority on the council.

Defending for Labour is Kenny Young, a former press officer for Ed Miliband.  The SNP candidate is Colin Cassidy, who fought Dalkeith ward in 2012.  Robert Hogg, the secretary of Mayfield and Easthouses community council, is standing as an independent.  Also on the ballot paper are Andrew Hardie for the Conservatives, Euan Davidson for the Lib Dems and Bill Kerr-Smith for the Scottish Green Party.

TROUP, Aberdeenshire council; caused by the death of Conservative councillor John Duncan, who had served on Aberdeenshire council since winning a by-election in 2002.

We finish this week with a large rural ward in the north-east of Scotland.  Troup runs along the north coast of Aberdeenshire from Banff to Fraserburgh without including either town; the name comes from Troup Head, a promontory roughly halfway in between those towns.  The ward's only town is Macduff, named not after the king of Scotland and Shakespeare character but after James Duff, the second Earl of Fife, who constructed the town's harbour in the late eighteenth century; it is the last place in the UK where deepwater fishing boats are built out of wood.  Outside Macduff the ward is miles and miles of tiny villages.

Since 2007 the ward has had three councillors, split one each between the SNP, the Tories and an independent.  The SNP polled 47% here in 2007 and would have been in with a chance of two seats if they had run two candidates; as it was, their single councillor died less than a year into his term, resulting in a by-election in May 2008 which the SNP won in the first round with 63% of the vote.  However, the SNP vote delined to 40% in 2012, independent candidates polling 31% and the Conservatives 21%.  That suggests that the Conservatives are unlikely to hold the seat, although this likely loss won't affect the situtation on Aberdeenshire council: the SNP are the largest party but the administration is an anti-SNP coalition with a secure majority.

The defending Tory candidate is Iain Taylor, a farmer.  The SNP are standing Ross Cassie, a driving examiner and PCS union rep from Macduff.  There are two independent candidates, Philip Mitchell and Alan Still; for Mitchell I shall simply refer you to his stream-of-consciousness conspiracy-theory-and-hyphen-laden election leaflet [http://electionleaflets.org/leaflets/8590/], while Still is a director of Deveronvale FC and president of the Aberdeenshire and District FA.  Also standing are Labour candidate Alan Duffill, a solicitor from Macduff who fought the ward in 2012; Ann Bell for the Lib Dems; and Darren Duncan for the Scottish Green Party.
