SWINTON SOUTH, Salford city council; caused by the death of Labour councillor Norbert Potter at the age of 73.  First elected in 2003 for Walkden South ward, he had continuous service on the council since winning a 2005 by-election in Barton ward, moving to Swinton South in 2011.  Also a director of Salford Citizens Advice Bureau, Potter had served in various council cabinet positions, including Planning and Town Twinning for three years.

In a previous life for your columnist he temped at Salford City Council for several months, and his mother has worked for the City Council for many years.  Of course, Salford City Council is not based on Salford itself but in the comparatively calmer town of Swinton, the next town out on the roads to Chorley and Liverpool.  A classic Lancashire industrial town, with cotton, bricks and coalmining being the main Victorian industries here, Swinton's economy is now based on the administration and on commuting to Manchester.  Modern famous sons of the town include the Master of the Queen's Music, Sir Peter Maxwell Davies, and the footballer Ryan Giggs.

Swinton South was a Labour/Tory fight before 2004 (the Tories winning in 1983, '87, '92 and 2000), but then much of the best Tory areas moved to Worsley and Boothstown ward in boundary changes.  In June 2004, the first election on the current ward boundaries, this was a Labour ward but the Lib Dems very close behind; the three Labour majorities were 152, 96 and 10 votes.  Labour did well to hold a by-election in March 2005, a few weeks before the general election of that year, but in the 2005-10 parliament the Lib Dems finally broke through and gained all three Labour seats over the period 2006-2008.  Labour regained the ward in 2010 partly thanks to a split in the Lib Dem vote, the outgoing councillor Joe O'Neill standing for re-election as an independent and polling 17% in fourth place; in the two elections since then O'Neill has stood as a Green Party candidate and again polled 17% each time.  The Lib Dem vote in Salford faded away with the establishment of the Coalition (they have no candidate in the by-election), allowing Labour to win this ward easily in 2011 and 2012 with a very divided opposition; O'Neill was runner-up in 2012, just ahead of the Tories.

Defending for Labour is Neil Blower, a former soldier who has fought in Kosovo and Iraq and is writer-in-residence at the local website Salford Online.  Joe O'Neill stands again for the Green Party, while former teacher Anne Broomhead is the Conservative candidate.  Also on the ballot paper are Paul Whitelegg for the English Democrats, Steve Cullen for the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition and UKIP's Robert Wakefield.

9th January

BOROUGH GREEN AND LONG MILL, Tonbridge and Malling district council; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor David Evans due to ill-health.

Nestled in the middle of the North Downs, Borough Green is a large village at the crossing of the Sevenoaks-Maidstone and Gravesend-Tonbridge roads.  Although it's essentially a sleepy commuter village (it's on the Victoria - Maidstone - Ashford line) Borough Green does have one iconic export; the Geographers' A-Z Map Company, publishers of the famous London A-Z street map, is based in Borough Green.  The Borough Green and Long Mill ward also includes three rural parishes: Platt to the east, and Plaxtol and Shipbourne to the south; Plaxtol parish includes the 13th century manor house of Old Soar Manor, which is open to the public.

The electoral profile of this ward is basically safe Conservative, with the closest recent result coming at the 2011 election which saw a slate of Independent candidates poll well.  The other party to stand regularly is Labour, whose local candidates all come from the Hayman family.

Defending for the Conservatives is Stuart Murray, the husband of one of the remaining Conservative councillors.  One of the independents from 2011, Mike Taylor, is standing again, as is Labour's Victoria Hayman.  Howard Porter, from the nearby village of Trottiscliffe, is the Green Party candidate, and UKIP have nominated West Malling-based David Waller.

HAVERHILL EAST, St Edmundsbury borough council; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Les Ager at the age of 75.  A district councillor since 2007 and twice Mayor of Haverhill, he was awarded the British Empire Medal in the 2012 Birthday Honours for services to music in Haverhill; he co-founded the Haverhill Operatic Society and for thirty years was conductor of the Haverhill Silver Band.

Suffolk's most south-westerly town, Haverhill (the E and middle H are silent) is a New Town in all but name; in the last fifty years its population has increased fivefold, mainly due to immigration from London in the 1960s; Haverhill was chosen for London overspill because of its good railway links, but by the time the Londoners moved in the railways had all fallen under the Beeching Axe, resulting in major rush-hour congestion on the road to Cambridge.  The town's accent is an Estuary rather than a Suffolk one, and its economic profile is heavy on manufacturing, with toothbrushes, chemicals and pharmaceuticals all made here.

This manufacturing profile explains the rather narrow Labour win in this ward at the 2003 election, with the three Labour seats having majorities over the Conservatives of 42, 6 and 4 votes.  The ward was a very easy Tory gain in 2007 (one seat having gone Tory in a 2004 by-election) but came under threat again from Labour in 2011; while Agar had a large personal vote his running-mates were elected by just 16 and 14 votes over the leading Labour candidate.  One factor which can't be seen from previous borough election results is UKIP, who gained the local county seat (Haverhill East and Kedington) from the Tories in May last year with a big majority, and also took a seat in the two-member county division covering the rest of the town.

Convincing cases can be made for any of the Tories, Labour and UKIP winning this by-election so this is one to watch.  Defending for the Conservatives is David Roach, a member of the Labour-controlled Haverhill town council.  Former Mayor of Haverhill and town councillor for this ward Pat Hanlon makes a second attempt to get back the borough council seat he lost in 2007; he beat the alphabet to be the leading Labour candidate in 2011 and, as stated, was only 14 votes away from winning.  Regular Lib Dem candidate Ken Rolph stands again, and UKIP's candidate is their local county councillor Tony Brown.
