With eleven by-elections to cover this week, there is a certain lack of detail in this week's preview.  Nonetheless, here on English Elections there is a good selection of by-elections.  In the North, Labour are defending a super-safe seat in Widnes; in the Midlands the Tories have a seat to defend in the Nottingham suburbs and there is an independent-held county council seat up for election in Stamford, Lincolnshire; while in the south the Tories have seats to defend in Berkshire and Hampshire plus Labour and Lib Dem defences in Aylesbury.  Welsh Elections takes us to rural Carmarthenshire, and Scottish Elections brings news of polls in the cathedral city of Elgin and at completely the opposite end of the Highlands.  But in a week where the Tories are defending a by-election in the Home Secretary's constituency, we start with a tale of terrorism from a much earlier age...

WASHINGTON EAST, Sunderland city council, Tyne and Wear; caused by the resignation of a Labour councillor Neville Padgett, ostensibly on health grounds although he had also been the subject of recent adverse publicity over his council expenses.

"Whisht! lads, haad yor gobs,
An' aa'll tell ye all an aaful story.
Whisht! lads, haad yor gobs,
An' aa'll tell ye 'boot the worm."

We come to the New Town of Washington, County Durham, as my grandma (who was born there) always called it.  The Washington East ward consists of several disconnected residential areas overlooking the River Wear on the north side, together with Mount Pleasant on the south side of the river.  In folklore this area was terrorised by the Lambton Worm, as told in a song well-known across the North East.

It says something for how far Labour sunk during the Brown administration that this ward was won by the Tories three times: the 2007 and 2008 ordinary elections and a September 2007 by-election.  Labour have reasserted their dominance since then, and in May's ordinary election UKIP narrowly took over second place from the Tories (Lab 41% UKIP 26% C 25%).

This by-election will be defended for Labour by Tony Taylor, who is opposed by UKIP's Alistair Baxter and the Tories' Hilary Johnson; also standing are Stephen O'Brien for the Lib Dems and Tony Murphy for the Green Party.

TOTON AND CHILWELL MEADOWS, Broxtowe borough council, Nottinghamshire; caused by the death of Conservative councillor Marilyn Hegyi.  A Broxtowe councillor since winning a 2009 by-election, Hegyi's greatest achievement as a councillor was probably to get Toton officially recognised by Royal Mail.

This is a middle-class Nottingham suburb, but its demography belies an industrial past: Toton is a railway town and the site of what was once Europe's largest railway marshalling yard, which took in coal from the Nottinghamshire coalfield and sorted it for distribution all over the UK.  The marshalling yard is still there although it's a lot less busy than it used to be, while there is an intriguing possible future development: if High Speed 2 gets off the ground, its East Midlands station could be sited here.

Toton and Chilwell Meadows seems to have a high councillor attrition rate: this is the ward's third by-election in just over five years, and the second by-election in the ward this term.  The last by-election, in March 2012, was a very easy Tory hold, the party polling 48% against evenly divided opposition.  Their candidate to defend this by-election is counsellor (as opposed to Councillor) Mia Kee, who is opposed by Labour's David Patrick and UKIP's Darryl Paxford.

KINGSWAY, Halton council; caused by the death of Labour councillor Frank Fraser at the age of 81.  The Mayor of Halton in 2009-10, he was first elected to Halton council in 1997 after a career in the printing industry.

Welcome to the dirtiest, ugliest and most depressing town in England (according to the Daily News, writing in 1888).  This is, of course, Widnes, a town called into existence by the Industrial Revolution as the major chemicals town in north-west England.  Back in the 1960s, Paul Simon was so depressed by the town that he wrote a song while waiting for a train out of the place; that song was "Homeward Bound", which eventually reached No 9 in the charts for Simon and Garfunkel.  The Kingsway ward is named after the road which runs south from Widnes railway station towards the town centre.

Politically this is a very safe Labour ward which over the last five years has become super-safe.  The exception to this came in 2010, when Labour messed up their nomination and failed to get on the ballot, resulting in the bizarre sight of the Lib Dems narrowly beating the Green Party for a council seat in Widnes.  The unlucky councillor to lose his seat as a result of the messup was Frank Fraser; not a good way to finish his mayoral year, but he had the consolation of returning to the council a year later without having to fight a contested election.  In 2012 Labour beat the Lib Dems 90-10 in a straight fight; after that experience the Lib Dems didn't defend their seat in the ward when it came up for re-election in May, and Labour gained back a seat they should never have lost by polling 76% in a straight fight with UKIP.

Andrea Wall defends the seat for Labour, against opposition from UKIP's Brad Bradshaw who fought the ward in May, Duncan Harper for the Tories and Paul Meara for the Lib Dems.

STAMFORD NORTH, Lincolnshire county council; caused by the death of Independent councillor John Hicks at the age of 72.  A retired teacher and keen sportsman, Hicks had served on Lincolnshire county council since 2009.

From one of England's ugliest towns to one of England's prettiest, although Stamford North is not the pretty part of town, consisting of two mostly residential wards on the northern edge of town.  This is a mostly Conservative area with the main opposition coming from independents: in the 2011 district council elections the Tories and independents split the four district council seats in the division equally between them, with some decent scores for Labour.  In the county division, Labour were only 97 votes behind the Tories back on general election day in 2005; Hicks won his seat in 2009, beating the Tories by 42 votes, and made the division safe in 2013.

Hicks was affiliated with the well-organised county council group Lincolnshire Independents, who have nominated Stamford town councillor Max Sawyer to contest the by-election.  The Tory candidate is Matthew Lee, who is a Peterborough city councillor but lives in Stamford.  Also standing are Mark Ashberry for Labour, Harrish Bisnauthsing for the Lib Dems and Robert Foulkes for UKIP.

GATEHOUSE, and SOUTHCOURT, Aylesbury Vale district council, Buckinghamshire; caused respectively by the resignation of Lib Dem councillor Stuart Jarvis and Labour councillor Michael Beall.

These wards are both urban wards within the Buckinghamshire county town of Aylesbury.  Gatehouse is to the north-west of the town centre, while Southcourt ward lies to the south of the town centre and railway station.  Gatehouse ward includes a large industrial area next to the railway line, while Southcourt is more residential.

Both wards were safe Lib Dem areas in 2003, and a previous by-election in Gatehouse ward in July 2006 was a comfortable Lib Dem hold.  While Gatehouse remains safe for the party (the Lib Dems polled 41% in 2011, with the Tories best of the rest on 23%), they lost a seat to Labour in Southcourt at the 2011 election to give split representation.  However, that was back in 2011; in the 2013 county elections UKIP gained the county divisions covering both wards: in Aylesbury North-West, whose major part is Gatehouse ward, the Kippers had a comfortable lead that year (45%, to 26% for the Lib Dems and 15% for Labour) but Aylesbury South-West, which is based on Southcourt ward was a closer affair (UKIP 35% LD 33% Lab 19%) with UKIP eventually prevailing by a majority of 53 votes.

In the Gatehouse by-election the defending Lib Dem candidate is Anders Christensen.  The Tories have nominated Samantha North, Labour's candidate is Lucio Tangi and UKIP are standing Graham Cadle, while the ballot paper is completed by independent candidate George Entecott and the Greens' Mary Hunt.  In Southcourt the defending Labour candidate is Mark Bateman, who is opposed by the Lib Dems' Peter Agoro, the Tories' Sarah Sproat, UKIP's Brian Adams (who is the local county councillor) and the Greens' Andrew Kulig.

BRANSGORE AND BURLEY, New Forest district council, Hampshire; caused by the death of a Conservative councillor Ann Hickman at the age of 54.  Chairman of Bransgore parish council for seven years, Hickman had sat on New Forest district council since 2011 and was known for campaigning for safer roads.

Hard up against the Dorset boundary, this is a rural ward covering a large chunk of the south-western New Forest.  The main centres of population are Bransgore and Burley themselves, together with the village of Hinton on the A35 Lyndhurst-Christchurch road.

This ward is safely Conservative; in May 2011 the Tories polled 66% with the Lib Dems quite a long way behind in second place.  The ward is part of the safe Tory Lyndhurst county division.

Defending for the Tories is Richard Frampton, a former councillor for this ward back in the dim and distant past who is now chairman of Bransgore parish council and also sits on the New Forest national park authority.  The Lib Dems are not standing a candidate, but Labour's Brian Curwain (from Hinton) and UKIP's Roz Mills (from Bransgore) ensure a contested election.

COX GREEN, Windsor and Maidenhead council; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Alan Mellins, who had got into hot water for suggesting during a council debate that travellers who refused eviction should be executed.

This ward is in the Maidenhead half of the Windsor and Maidenhead council area, and essentially is the area immediately to the south of the A404(M) Maidenhead bypass.  While Cox Green is a separate civil parish, this area is effectively a Maidenhead suburb and part of the town's built-up area.

Over the last twelve years Cox Green has swung strongly to the right: from a safe Lib Dem ward in 2003 it turned into a Lib Dem/Tory marginal in 2007 and the Tories made the gains in 2011, beating the Lib Dems by 53% to 32%.

The Tories have gone for youth in this by-election, selecting 21-year-old Ross McWilliams.  The Lib Dem candidate is Cox Green parish councillor Gareth Jones.  Also on the ballot are Labour's Bob Horner, a retired bank manager, and UKIP's Lance Carter, a business owner and qualified football coach.

TRELECH, Carmarthenshire county council; caused by the resignation of independent councillor Dai Thomas, who has represented the area in local government for over fifty years, on health grounds.

This deeply rural division is in western Carmarthenshire, generally to the west and north-west of Carmarthen.  Trelech itself lies about ten miles north-west of Carmarthen, and the division runs south from there along the B4299 road to the village of Meidrim, which according to the notice of poll is actually the ward's largest settlement (although only 496 electors are registered there).  It's strongly Welsh-speaking, and did I say deeply rural earlier?

Dai Thomas - "Dai Trelech" as he was known locally - had been the councillor here for an extremely long time, certainly since before the reorganisation of 1974 when Carmarthen Rural District was the local authority.  He was 90 years old at the time of his resignation, and had faced contested elections for his last two terms: at the most recent poll in 2012 he beat Plaid by 50-34.

Carmarthenshire council is run by a Labour/Independent coalition, and for the by-election the independent group have nominated Hugh Phillips, from Cwmbach, one of the scattered villages within the division.  Plaid will stand Jean Lewis, from Meidrim, and the Lib Dem candidate is Selwyn Runnett, also from Meidrim.

ELGIN CITY NORTH, Moray council; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Barry Jarvis who is pursuing a teaching career.

One of two urban wards within the generally rural Moray council, Elgin City North does exactly what it says on the tin.  It includes the Bishopmill area of Moray to the north of the River Lossie, together with the ruined cathedral, part of the city centre and the housing along the East Road (the A96 towards Aberdeen).

The two elections held here under proportional representation have both seen the SNP leading with Labour second.  The SNP stood only one candidate in 2007, with the ward's three seats going one each to the SNP, Labour and an independent.  In 2012 the independent councillor stood down and his seat very narrowly went to a second SNP candidate, whose majority over the Tory candidate in the final round was less than one vote.  Overall first preferences in 2012 were 43% to the SNP, 30% for Labour and 17% for the Conservatives.

Labour have it all to do in this by-election.  Their candidate is Craig Graham, a 21-year-old history and politics student at Moray College.  The SNP candidate is Kirsty Reid, a 32-year-old who runs her own dog care business.  A crowded ballot paper also features Alex Griffiths from the Tories, independent Sandy Cooper, Morvern Forrest for the Scottish Green Party and UKIP's Ramsay Urquhart.

SOUTH KINTYRE, Argyll and Bute council; caused by the resignation of SNP councillor John Semple on the day after the independence referendum.

One of the most remote parts of the Scottish mainland, the South Kintyre ward lies at the end of the long Kintyre peninsula.  The ward is based on the town of Campbeltown, which is around 140 miles and well over three hours from Glasgow by road.  The town's isolation means that the most convenient way to travel is by air or sea; on weekdays there are two return flights to Glasgow, and ferries connect the town with Ballycastle in Northern Ireland twice a week and with Ardrossan, via Arran, in the summer months.  Campbeltown itself is a fishing port named after Archibald Campbell, earl of Argyle, which also specialises in Scotch whisky; the town has three distilleries and forms its own malt whisky producing region.  

There was once a canal and a light railway connecting Campbeltown to Macrihanish, a name which will be familiar to listeners of the Shipping Forecast; the reason for these transport links is that Macrihanish was home to one of Britain's smallest coalfields.  Since the exhaustion of the coal Macrihanish's economy has been based on the nearby Campbeltown Airport, formerly RAF Macrihanish which was a key military airport during the Cold War; a legacy of this is that Campbeltown airport has the longest public runway in Scotland and was certified as an emergency landing site for the Space Shuttle.  Sadly, this is not the ward's only link with the air: the southern end of the peninsula (the well-known Mull of Kintyre) is littered with plane wrecks, notably that of an RAF Chinook which crashed on the peninsula in 1994, killing almost all of the UK's senior Northern Ireland intelligence experts.

Argyll and Bute's last first-past-the-post election was in 2003, with the Tories' Donald Kelly winning South Kintyre, independent Alastair McKinlay carrying Campbeltown Central and and the Lib Dems' Rory Colville elected by East Central Kintyre.  Kelly and Colville were re-elected under proportional representation in 2007, with McKinlay standing down and his seat going to the SNP's John Semple.  In that election Kelly polled so far over the quota that the Tories had a chance of two seats, but the transfers weren't there for them: Colville and Kelly's running-mate got ahead of the Labour candidate, who had started third, on transfers from Kelly's surplus, and Labour transfers elected Semple and Colville to the final two vacancies.  The three councillors were easily re-elected in 2012, the Tories not trying for two seats this time; they polled 46% of the first preferences to 25% for the SNP and 14% for the Lib Dems, with three independent candidates getting 15% between them.

That large Tory vote will make this SNP defence a difficult one, and the fact that the SNP group on Argyll and Bute council has more or less collapsed doesn't help matters.  Their candidate is John Armour, a broadcaster with the local radio station Argyll FM.  The Tories have selected Charlotte Hanbury, who gives an address fifty miles away in Lochgilphead; she fought her home ward of Mid Argyll in the 2012 election.  Also standing are Joyce Oxborrow for the Lib Dems and Michael Kelly for Labour.

This will be Scotland's last local by-election of 2014, and your columnist shall return in the new year.  In the meantime, Scottish Elections wishes a Merry Christmas and a Happy Hogmanay to Sid, Doris and all our other readers, and to close for the year we end with a song which is appropriate for both the time of year and location.
