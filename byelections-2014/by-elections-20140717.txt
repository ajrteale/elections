By-elections on 17th July 2014:

AIRFIELD, King's Lynn and West Norfolk borough council; caused by the resignation of Green Party councillor Lori Allen.

The Airfield ward is a large rural ward in western Norfolk, running down to the River Nar on its northern boundary and the River Great Ouse at its western extent.  The airfield of the name is RAF Marham, still a very active airfield with three squadrons of Tornados based here.  The polling district covering the RAF station accounts for around a third of the ward's electors; however, servicemen rarely vote in local elections so a low turnout (even by local by-election standards) can be expected.  Away from the airbase the largest villages in the ward are Marham itself and Runcton Holme, down on the Great Ouse floodplain.

Airfield was very strongly Conservative when the current ward was created in 2003, and the two Tory councillors were re-elected unopposed in 2007.  However, in the 2011 election the Conservatives unaccountably stood only one candidate for the two seats; the beneficiary of this decision was the Green Party's Lori Allen who beat Labour and an independent candidate standing on an anti-incinerator ticket (an incinerator proposed for near King's Lynn has been a highly toxic politicial issue in this district for most of the last decade).  Matters got worse for the local Conservatives in the 2013 Norfolk county council elections, in which they lost one of the county divisions covering this ward to UKIP and held UKIP off only narrowly in the other.

Defending for the Green Party is farmer Jonathan Burr.  The Conservative candidate is Geoff Hipperson, borough councillor for this ward until 2011 and chairman of Shouldham parish council.  Maths teacher Sebastian Polhill stands for Labour, and Watlington parish councillor Bob Scully is the UKIP candidate.

CHURCH HILL, Redditch borough council, Worcestershire; caused by the resignation of UKIP councillor Dave Small after just two weeks in office.  Small was elected as councillor for this ward on 22nd May this year but was almost immediately expelled from UKIP over racist and homophobic Facebook comments.

Well, that didn't take long.  Less than two months have elapsed since the 2014 ordinary elections and we already have our first vacancy among the councillors elected that day.  This vacancy has occurred in the Church Hill ward, the north-east corner of the new town of Redditch; started in 1975 and one of Redditch's largest developments, Church Hill is described as a social planning experiment, with social housing concentrated in the south of the estate, private housing to the north and services in the centre.  

The social mix adds up to a normally-Labour-inclined ward which since 2004 had been lost by the party only once - to the Tories in 2010, by 19 votes after they came 11 votes short in 2008.  The Tory seat was duly lost in May's ordinary election, but not to Labour: to a UKIP candidate who quickly proved to be too much of a racist, loony and closet fruitcake for even UKIP to handle.  Mind, this UKIP performance - a 50-vote majority over Labour - wasn't a one-off: last year the party split with Labour the two county council seats in the local Arrow Valley East division, which had voted Conservative in 2009.

Defending for UKIP is Len Harris, chairman of the local party branch.  The second-, third-, fourth-, fifth- and sixth-placed candidates from May are all trying again: respectively they are Nina Wood-Ford for Labour, Kathy Haslam for the Tories, Lee Bradley for the Green Party, perennial Lib Dem candidate David Gee and independent Agnieszka Wiecek.  Completing the ballot paper is a second independent candidate, Isabel Armstrong.

COLEHILL EAST, East Dorset district council; caused by the death of Liberal Democrat councillor Don Wallace at the age of 95.  Chairman of the council in 1995/6, Wallace served for 41 years in elected office on East Dorset district council, Dorset county council and Colehill parish council.  After serving in West Africa and Burma during the Second World War, Wallace had a career in personnel management in his native Birmingham and Dorset, and also worked as a university lecturer.

From one of the shortest-serving councillors in recent times to one of the longest.  Colehill is a village north of Poole about whom nobody seems to have very much to say; the Wikipedia article is long on speculation about what might have happened here in prehistoric times but short on information after about 1500.  The deprivation indices show this area to be very much at the rich end of the spectrum, so I'll take a wild guess and say that there are a fair number of people here who commute to Poole and Bournemouth.

Despite (or perhaps because of) his age, Wallace doesn't appear to have had much of a personal vote and badly trailed his Lib Dem colleague Janet Dover at the May 2011 election in this safe Lib Dem ward.  Dover is also the county councillor for the area and increased her majority in the 2013 county elections; bad news for the local Tories in their quest to regain the marginal parliamentary seat of Mid Dorset and North Poole.

Two Colehill parish councillors will square off in this by-election: in the yellow corner is Lib Dem defender Barry Roberts, while in the blue corner parish council chairman Graeme Smith challenges for the Conservatives.  In the purple corner is UKIP's David Mattocks, who describes himself as a "business broker", whatever that means.  Labour have thrown in the towel, so those are your three candidates.

COWLEY, Oxford city council; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Helen O'Hara.

In south-eastern Oxford, Cowley is well-known for motor vehicle manufacturing, with BMW's Mini factory today continuing a tradition going back to the nineteenth century.  One of the nineteenth-century manufacturers in this area was John Allen and Sons, which made agricultural machinery until the 1980s; the site of their factory has been redeveloped into a retail park called the John Allen Centre which lies at the centre of the modern Cowley ward.  Further out of the city is the Oxford Business Park next to the ring road, a modern redevelopment of the old Morris Motors factory; further in is Florence Park, a popular neighbourhood built in the 1920s for Cowley factory workers.

The Cowley factories have a reputation for strong trade unionism, and it's appropriate that the modern Cowley ward is safe for Labour, with the exception of a fluke Lib Dem win in 2006; the Lib Dem councillor who won that year later defected to Labour in whose colours he was re-elected in 2010.  Labour also hold the Cowley division of Oxfordshire county council, which includes parts of neighbouring wards.

Defending for Labour is David Henwood, a secondary school teacher and former engineer at the Cowley body plant.  May's election saw a surprise runner-up: an independent candidate campaigning to save the Temple Cowley swimming pool, who appeared on the ballot paper only as "Artwell"; he is back on the campaign trail for this by-election.  Law lecturer Hazel Dawe is the Green Party candidate, while environmental scientist Katharine Harborne stands for the Tories; Nepalese restaurateur Prakash Sharma is the Lib Dem nominee, and completing the ballot paper is UKIP's local party chair and PPC Ian Macdonald.

HOOKSTONE, Harrogate borough council, North Yorkshire; caused by the death of Liberal Democrat councillor Reg Marsh.

This is a ward on the south-eastern outskirts of Harrogate, either side of the A661 road to Wetherby.  While it is primarily residential rather than touristy (as much of Harrogate town centre is), nonetheless the ward receives many visitors each year as it is the location of the Great Yorkshire Showground.  On polling day you can visit an exhibition being put on by Motability; or you can wait two weeks for the Great Northern Needlecraft Show, at which one of the quilt exhibits (the one with the two dragons with intertwined tails) is destined, once the show is over, for your columnist's bed.  Thanks Mum!

For years a safe Lib Dem ward, Hookstone ward has been represented by Reg Marsh and his wife Pat since the current ward was created in 2002.  Pat Marsh was re-elected in May in the ward's closest result yet, the Tories cutting the Lib Dem majority to less than 9 points and turning the ward into a marginal.  That swing since 2010 suggests that the Lib Dems may have their work cut out to regain the Harrogate and Knaresborough parliamentary seat at next May's general election; an impression reinforced by the Tories gaining the Harrogate Oatlands county council division (which covers most of this ward) from the Lib Dems in last year's county elections.

Defending for the Lib Dems is Clare Skardon, who fought the safe-Tory Stray ward in May's ordinary elections.  The Tory challenger is Phil Headford, who runs a garden design company.  Also standing are Alan Henderson for UKIP and Pat(ricia) Foxall for Labour.

LEDBURY, and LEOMINSTER SOUTH, Herefordshire council; caused by the deaths of Conservative councillors Peter Watts and Roger Hunt respectively.  Watts, who died at the age of 66 after a four-year battle with bone cancer, had served on Herefordshire council since 2003 and was a Ledbury town councillor from 2000 until 2013; a former paratrooper and fireman, he had a key role in encouraging new employment on the site of the former Robertson's jam factory in Ledbury.  Hunt, a four-time Mayor of Leominster, also had a fight with cancer, successfully raising a six-figure sum in 2007 to secure treatment in the USA for a very rare form of spinal cancer; his death came at the age of 68.

Here we have two of the beautiful small market towns which you only seem to get in the Marches.  In the shadow of the Malvern Hills, Ledbury can be found at the south-eastern corner of Herefordshire on the Hereford-Worcester railway line.  The town is noted for its large number of old timber-framed buildings, and has a light industrial base: packaging is manufactured here, while the site of the Robertson's jam factory is now used by Universal Beverages to process fruit for cider producers.  

Leominster (pronounced Lemster, for those who weren't aware) is the only major town in northern Herefordshire, located on the main road and railway line through the Marches from Hereford to Shrewsbury.  An ancient religious centre, Leominster was established by the wool trade (wool from local sheep was especially prized) and now, like Ledbury, a large amount of its economy is based on tourism.  In case your columnist hasn't said this before, the Marches are a very beautiful part of the country.

The three-member Ledbury ward covers the whole of the town together with the smaller parishes of Eastnor to the east and Donnington to the south.  It returned an Independent, a Conservative and a Lib Dem councillor in 2003, but the Conservatives swept the ward in 2007 and held it a by-election on general election day in 2010, caused by one of the Conservative councillors being elected to the European Parliament.  At the most recent local election in 2011 the localist political party It's Our County (Herefordshire) split the ward again by taking one of the three Conservative seats.

The Leominster South ward is the south of the town itself together with a few hamlets which lie within the Leominster parish boundary.  In 2003 the two seats split Tory/Labour; the Conservatives gained the Labour seat in 2007 but then lost a by-election to an independent candidate in October 2008.  The Tory and Independent councillors were both re-elected in 2011.

Ledbury's by-election is a three-way fight.  Defending for the Tories is Allen Conway, a town councillor and former Mayor of Ledbury.  The present Mayor of Ledbury, 33-year-old sales manager Terry Widdows, is the It's Our County candidate.  UKIP's nominee is Paul Stanford, a former headteacher who has served in the Royal Navy; he gives an adress eight miles away in Weston Beggard.

In Leominster South the Tory defence is led by Wayne Rosser, community dog warden.  The independent candidate is Angela Pendleton, who ran the gold-medal-winning Leominster in Bloom team.  Nominated for the Green Party is Jenny Bartlett from Leintwardine, who describes herself as a "former mapping specialist"; perhaps she can explain how the new OS Election Maps website is better than the old.  (Hint: it isn't, although your columnist has been informed than an upgrade is in the works which may change that.)  Labour's Emma Pardoe is, like all the candidates previously mentioned, a Leominster town councillor; the odd candidate out in that respect is UKIP's Liz Portman-Lewis.

MABE, PERRANARWORTHAL AND ST GLUVIAS, Cornwall council; caused by the resignation of UKIP councillor Michael Keogh for personal reasons.

This division of Cornwall can be found wrapped around the western side of Penryn.  It is named after its three constituent parishes, with Mabe (a granite quarrying centre) at the southern end, St Gluvias (a suburb of Penryn) in the middle and Perranarworthal at the north end.  The name of Perranarworthal commemorates St Piran, the patron saint of Cornwall; and the village became the location of the eighteenth-century Perran iron foundry, now being redeveloped into homes.  One of the managers of the foundry built a mansion called Tullimaar House, where Eisenhower stayed for two weeks while organising the D-Day landings; appropriately, the house was later occupied by a naval rating at D-Day, the Nobel Prize-winning novelist Sir William Golding.  Golding died here in 1993, and his family still live in the mansion.

This ward has the same boundaries as the ward which was more simply called "Mabe" used at the inaugural Cornwall council election in 2009.  Both the previous elections on these boundaries have been very fragmented with the winner receiving around 30% of the vote; the Tories beat off the Lib Dems by 80 votes in 2009 but lost out to UKIP in 2013 by just three votes.  Before 2009 the area covered by this ward was in two local government districts; Perranarworthal was part of the old Carrick district and in a ward which generally returned Tories, while the other two parishes formed part of an independent-held ward on Kerrier district council.

Defending for UKIP is Pete Tisdale, a Mabe parish councillor.  The Tories are standing Peter Williams, a builder from Perranarworthal.  The Lib Dem candidate is John Ault, from Penryn; a university lecturer, former Cornwall county councillor and former chairman of the Electoral Reform Society, Ault has represented the Lib Dems on Top Gear and Exeter University on University Challenge.  Labour have selected Linda Hitchcox, from the village of Mawnan Smith to the south, and the Mebyon Kernow candidate is Karen Sumser-Lupson who, despite living in Cornwall, is chairman of the African Maritime Safety and Security Agency.

OBAN NORTH AND LORN, Argyll and Bute council; caused by the resignation of SNP councillor Louise Glen-Lee for personal reasons.

Up in the Highlands here, for a geographically vast ward which essentially contains the whole of the hinterland of Oban but only the northern third of the town itself (the other two-thirds of Oban is in a ward with Mull and various other islands).  The ward goes a long way inland along the line of the A85, past Dalmally and as far as Bridge of Orchy; also here are the Benderloch and Appin areas on the north side of Loch Etive, together with the island of Lismore in Loch Linnhe.  As well as tourism, one of the main drivers of the local economy is the hydroelectric power station at Ben Cruachan, knowledge of which once won your columnist a bottle of rare Belgian beer.

The ward was created for the 2007 elections in Scotland which were the first to be held under proportional representation.  In 2003 at the last first-past-the-post election, all four of the predecessor wards (Awe, Oban North, Ardconnel-Kilmore and North Lorn) returned independent councillors.  Two of the independents were re-elected in 2007, while one was defeated; the other two seats went to the Lib Dems and the SNP.  The SNP councillor died in 2011 and the SNP held the by-election, Louise Glen-Lee polling 44% of the vote; at the decisive stage of the count she had 51% of the vote to 25% for the Tories and 24% for an independent candidate.  In the 2012 election the Lib Dem vote collapsed and their seat went to a third independent, who defeated the second SNP candidate by a margin of less than one vote.  A by-election was held in May (simultaneously with the European elections) in the other Oban ward, which was unexpectedly won by Labour, so we should remember that even with Scottish by-elections using the Alternative Vote anything can still happen.

The SNP nomination for the by-election was messy: the party originally selected the losing candidate in the Oban South by-election, Iain MacLean, but he then withdrew at a late stage.  The replacement SNP candidate is Gerry Fisher, from the hamlet of Ledaig in Benderloch.  There are two competing independent candidate: John MacGregor from North Connel and Marri Malloy from Oban.  Standing for the Conservatives is Andrew Vennard from Oban, and completing the ballot paper is the ward's first Labour candidate Kieron Green, from Oban.
