BUCKIE, Moray council; caused by the resignation of Independent councillor Anne McKay for personal reasons.

Moray district's third largest town (after Elgin and Forres), Buckie developed in the nineteenth century as a fishing port concentrating on shellfish.  The fishing industry is less important now, but related industries such as boatbuilding (the local shipyard is the main company refitting Britain's lifeboats) and the North Sea oil industry are still important to the local economy.  The ward named after Buckie, which returns three members to Moray council, also includes the villages of Rathven and Findochty to the east.

At local council level Buckie's votes traditionally to go independents.  In the last first-past-the-post council election in 2003 independents won two of the wards covering the town, the other (Buckie Central) being won by Labour.   The introduction of PR in 2007 led to a shake-up in the town's representation, as the two independent councillors stood down and the Labour councillor was defeated, two new indies and the SNP candidate (who topped the poll) winning.  The SNP tried for two seats in 2012 and managed to increase their vote from 1.29 quotas to 1.80 quotas, but it wasn't enough to dislodge the two independent councillors who polled 1.91 quotas between them and were both re-elected easily thanks to favourable Conservative transfers.

With the combined independents polling 48% in 2012 to the SNP's 45%, this by-election is difficult to call.  There are two new independent candidates: Gordon Cowie is a member of Buckie community council and formerly worked on the roads for Moray council, while Fochabers-based Mark MacRae is a director of Buckie Thistle football club.  The SNP have put up their second candidate from 2012 Linda McDonald, wife of the ward's current SNP councillor, while the Tories have re-selected their 2012 candidate Margaret Gambles, from Keith.  Don't wait up all night for the result, as the count is taking place on Friday.

CHADSMEAD, Lichfield district council, Staffordshire; caused by the disqualification of Conservative councillor Michael Fryers Snr who failed to attend any meetings of the council in six months.

Places which sound nice aren't always entirely so.  Lichfield is a generally beautiful and well-preserved cathedral city in the Midlands, but the Chadsmead ward - a tract of postwar housing in the north-west of the city - includes Lichfield's most deprived census district.  And it votes like it too; this is one of Labour's strongest wards in the city.  

At district level this ward has voted for all three main parties in the last eleven years; it returned a Tory and a Labour councillor in 2003 before the Conservatives gained the Labour seat at a by-election just before Christmas 2005.  In May 2007 the Lib Dems gained one of the Conservative seats, only to lose it back to the Tories in 2011.  The most recent city council elections, also held in 2011, saw the Tories win the ward's three seats, but a double by-election to the city council in September 2012 (caused by the resignations of Mike Fryers Snr and Jr) was won by the Lib Dems with Labour gaining the second seat up for election.  Chadsmead ward forms a quarter of the Lichfield City North county division, which was narrowly gained by Labour at the May 2013 county elections; given that the county division includes a safe Tory ward it's probable that Labour had a healthy lead here in May.

So, mixed messages there and this is a by-election in which anything could happen.  Defending for the Tories is Jon O'Hagan, who is involved in the Chadsmead Action Group.  The Lib Dem candidate is former district councillor Marion Bland who topped the poll in the 2012 city by-election.  Runner-up in that by-election was Labour's Caroline Wood, who stands in this by-election.  Completing the ballot paper is Bob Green, the UKIP candidate.

HEANOR EAST, Amber Valley borough council, Derbyshire; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Phil Hill due to work commitments.

Overlooking the Erewash valley on the Derbyshire side, Heanor is one of Derbyshire's small industrial towns, traditionally specialising in coal-mining and textiles.  With those industries now having declined to almost nothing the main local employer is a food factory which traditionally specialises in Christmas puddings.

Heanor East is one of those wards which holds the dubious distinction of having a BNP local councillor.  That happened in 2008, when the BNP took advantage of what was developing into a marginal Labour/Tory ward to come through the middle and win with 36% of the vote (to 33% for the Tories and 31% for Labour).  That is the only time in the twenty-first century that Labour have lost Heanor East; the party fought off close Tory challenges in 2006 and 2010 and easily regained the BNP seat in 2012.

Defending for Labour is Sheila Oakes.  The Tories have selected Steven Grainger, a Heanor and Loscoe town councillor (although not for this ward).  The ballot paper is completed by the Lib Dems' Kate Smith, who gives an address some miles away in Crich.
