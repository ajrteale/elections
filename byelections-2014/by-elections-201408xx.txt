KNIGHT'S HILL, Lambeth borough council, South London; caused by the disqualification of Labour councillor Sonia Winifred.  Winifred was a Lambeth council employee at the time of her election and was therefore inelegible to be a Lambeth councillor.

We have seen a couple of postponed polls in London since the 2014 borough elections, but this is the first by-election arising from the 2014 intake in what amounts to an unforced error by the Labour selection.  The Knight's Hill ward covers the western end of West Norwood, and is mostly in the West Norwood SE27 postcode with smaller parts in SW16 (Streatham) and SE19 (Upper Norwood).  The ward is served by West Norwood railway station, from which Southern run regular trains to Victoria and London Bridge.

The Wikipedia entry for Knight's Hill ward points out that the ward has an high proportion of pensioners for a London ward, and also a high proportion of people with long-term illnesses.  It's clearly not a particularly well-off area, and in this political climate that creates a safe Labour ward.  Not that it has always been so; the Liberal Democrats had a convincing win here in 2002 and only narrowly lost the ward to the Labour slate in 2006.  Since then the Lib Dems have fallen here to the extent that in last May's ordinary election the (very distant) second place was disputed by the Tories and the Greens.  In the 2012 GLA elections Ken beat Boris in the ward's ballot boxes 57-25, while Labour led on the London Member vote with 58%, to 16% for the Conservatives and 12% for the Greens.

Having resigned her employment, Sonia Winifred is seeking re-election for Labour.  Her opposition will come from the Tories' Heidi Nicholson, the Greens' Christopher Hocknell, the Lib Dems' Robert Hardware, UKIP's Robin Lambert and independent candidate Nelly Amos.

SOUTH NORMANTON EAST, Bolsover district council, Derbyshire; caused by the death of Labour councillor Terry Cook.

Covering only a relatively small part of South Normanton, this ward straddles the M1 motorway to the north of junction 28.  To the west of the motorway is very much the downmarket end of South Normanton, a classic ex-coalmining community developed from almost nothing in the early twentieth century, and whose coalmining had ceased by 1970.  To the east of the motorway is a significant local employer: the East Midlands Designer Outlet, an upmarket clothes shopping centre developed here thanks to its proximity to the M1 and good road links to Nottingham, Derby and Sheffield.  The designer outlet was partially destroyed by fire in 2004 but has been rebuilt and now appears to be thriving.

As usual, the equation "coal mining = safe Labour" applies.  The only competitive election here in recent years was the district election in 2007, in which the Labour slate was opposed only by a single BNP candidate, who lost out by just 98 votes.  The ward is split between two safe-Labour county divisions; UKIP were a fairly distant second in both of them last year.

Another easy Labour win is ensured by the candidate list, which reveals a straight Labour/Tory fight.  In the red corner is South Normanton parish councillor Tracey Cannon; in the blue corner is Robert Sainsbury, who wasn't that far off winning a seat in the more-upmarket South Normanton West ward at the last borough election in 2011.

WROXHAM, Broadland district council, Norfolk; caused by the resignation of a Liberal Democrat councillor Steve Buckle.

Back here again so soon?  This is the second by-election in Wroxham in just five months.

To repeat what I said then, Wroxham is a village on the southern bank of the River Bure.  The village has effectively merged with Hoveton on other side of the river (which here is the boundary between the Broadland and North Norfolk districts), and is sometimes called the capital of the Broads; its location on the Norwich-Cromer railway line meant Wroxham was one of the first places in the Broads where tourism became important, and Arthur Ransome's book Coot Club gives a flavour of what the area was like in the 1930s.  The modern Wroxham ward also includes the parishes of Salhouse and Rackheath to the south, and the detached village of Belaugh on the opposite bank of the Bure, with no bridge connecting Belaugh to the rest of the ward.

Wroxham's local politics has never been the same since a council by-election in October 2009 in which the dominating issue was a plan to turn Rackheath into an eco-town with thousands of homes.  At the time the ward's representation had been split between one Conservative and one Independent district councillor, but the death of the independent prompted the by-election, in which the Lib Dems made a sensational gain having polled just 8% of the vote at the previous election in 2007; their winning candidate was Ben McGilvray, who at the time was a 19-year-old history student at the University of York.  The Lib Dems proved it wasn't a fluke at the 2011 election by gaining the ward's other seat from the Conservatives.  McGilvray relocated away from the district and resigned from the council earlier this year, and the Lib Dems held the resulting by-election (held in March) comfortably enough.  The wider Wroxham county division remains fairly safe Conservative, with the oppsition evenly split four ways at last year's county elections.

Defending for the Liberal Democrats this time is Malcolm Springall, a Rackheath parish councillor.  The runner-up in the March by-election is standing again; she is Tory candidate Fran Whymark, who lives in Rackham and is chair of the local community trust.  UKIP have thrown in the towel after a poor performance in March, but regular Labour candidate Malcolm Kemp is having another crack at the ward.

NORTH JESMOND, Newcastle upon Tyne city council, Tyne and Wear; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Peter Andras, who has been appointed as a professor of computer science and informatics at Keele University in Staffordshire.  Andras had been a Newcastle upon Tyne city councillor since 2011 and was the Liberal Democrat candidate for Northumbria police and crime commissioner in 2012.

Directly to the north of Newcastle city centre, Jesmond has always been one of the city's most upmarket suburbs, and a list of famous former residents is essentially a Who's Who of people connected with Newcastle.  The North Jesmond ward is sandwiched between Jesmond Dene, a public park following the steep-sided Ouseburn valley which was once a site of pilgrimage, and the Town Moor to the west.  The ward is served by the West Jesmond station, one of the busiest stations on the Tyne and Wear metro.  Its proximity to Newcastle and Northumbria universities has resulted in an increasing student population in recent years.

In Northern cities this sort of demographic (see also places such as Didsbury in Manchester, Headingley in Leeds, Hallam in Sheffield) produces a safe Liberal Democrat ward during the Blair and Brown years, but one in which the party came under increasing pressure after the formation of the Coalition.  Unlike Didsbury and Headingley, the Lib Dems have so far managed to keep hold of all three seats in North Jesmond, but the majorities have often been small - Labour were 100 votes behind at the 2011 election and just 32 votes behind the Lib Dems in May.  The August timing of this by-election may be connected to the fact that the ward's student population will be on vacation; the Lib Dems are not exactly flavour of the month among students at the moment.

Defending for the Liberal Democrats is Gerard Keating, a former councillor for Blakelaw ward who stood down from the council in 2012.  The runner-up in May's ordinary election, Peter Smith, tries again for Labour.  The Green Party have selected psychotherapist Shehla Naqvi, while the Tories again run local businessman Duncan Crute who fought the ward in May.  Completing the ballot paper is UKIP's Daniel Thompson, who stood in May in his home ward of West Gosforth.
