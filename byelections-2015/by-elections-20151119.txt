There are seven by-elections on 19th November 2015, of which four are in England and three in Wales.

AYLESFORD GREEN, Ashford borough council, Kent; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Kate Hooker for family reasons.

For the first of this week's English by-elections we are in Ashford, Kent, a late twentieth-century boom towm which has benefited from good road and rail links to London and the Continent, thanks to its Eurostar international station.  The Aylesford Green ward covers two distinct parts of south-eastern Ashford bisected by the High Speed 1 line, with only footpaths connecting them: to the east is Aylesford Green itself, an area of postwar London overspill housing named after a small area of open space next to the Old Mill Stream; while to the west lies the New Town area, originally built by the South Eastern Railway in the 1840s as its main locomotive works with adjacent housing for railway staff.  Railway use of the site ended here in the 1980s and the works are now the Old Railway Works Industrial Estate.

The history of the ward is reflected in a distinctly working-class population and high levels of social housing.  Despite that, the ward has a history of close results.  In 2003 it was won by the Ashford Independents, a well-organised localist group who beat Labour by 35 votes.  Labour didn't contest the 2007 election, in which the Ashford Independents lost their seat to the Lib Dems by just ten votes.  However, the Lib Dems didn't defend their seat in 2011 and Labour made the pickup, beating the Ashford Independents by a single vote.  May's election was relatlively sedate, Labour winning 55-45 in a straight fight with the Conservatives.  At county level this is part of the Ashford East division, which has been Lib Dem since 2005 but was a three-way marginal in 2013 with UKIP second and the Tories third.

Defending for Labour is Gordon Miller, a Unite member and Salvationist who stood in May's election in the neighbouring Norman ward and lost it to the Conservatives.  The Tories have gone for youth in selecting Alex Howard, chairman of the Ashford branch of Conservative Future.  Also on the ballot paper are a couple of familiar names.  The Lib Dems' Adrian Gee-Turner is a former Hackney councillor and was runner-up in the Mayor of Hackney election in 2010; the Ashford Independents' candidate Christine Kathawick-Smith is a retired nurse hoping to join her husband David on the council; the Green Party have selected Thom Pizzey, a parish councillor for the village of Stanhope which was been swallowed up by Ashford's expansion; last but not least UKIP are represented by Harriet Yeo, a former Labour borough councillor (for the neighbouring Norman ward) and NEC member who fought Folkestone and Hythe for UKIP in the general election.
