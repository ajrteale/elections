There are seven by-elections on 19th November 2015, of which four are in England and three in Wales.

In Wales there are two seats up for election in Gwynedd, with Plaid Cymru and the localist Llais Gwynedd defending one each, together with a Labour defence in Carmarthenshire.

In England Labour have a seat to defend in Ashford, Kent, while the Lib Dems face an uphill struggle in Epsom, Surrey.  But we start this week with two crucial by-elections in Norfolk.


SOUTH SMALLBURGH and WATTON, Norfolk county council; caused respectively by the resignations of Liberal Democrat councillor David Thomas and UKIP councillor Stan Hebborn.  Thomas' resignation is due to work commitments, while Hebborn, who was deputy leader of the UKIP group, 

Norfolk county council is having a glut of by-elections at the moment: these are the fifth and sixth by-elections to the county council this year, and possibly the most crucial.  We start in the west of the county at Watton, about 25 miles west of Norwich.  This is a small market town probably best known for the former RAF Watton, a Bomber Command and USAF base during the Second World War which has now been mostly developed for housing.  The county division also includes four parishes to the east of the town which formerly formed Templar ward on the district council.

South Smallburgh, on the other hand, is a rural division in the north-east of the county with no large town, running from the coast at Waxham inland to the Broads.  The name refers not to Smallburgh itself - which is not in the division - but to the Smallburgh Rural District which existed before 1974.  The largest polling station, with just over 1,000 electors, is in Ludham.

The reason these by-elections are crucial is the makeup of Norfolk county council.  The Conservatives lost control in the 2013 election and the council is now run by a coalition of everybody else.  Going into these by-elections, the ruling coalition controls 42 seats plus these two vacancies, to 40 seats for the Conservatives, so if the Tories can gain both by-elections they will hold half the seats and might challenge for the council leadership.

Let's see how likely that is.  Turning first to South Smallburgh, which is that rarest of things - a council by-election in a Lib Dem-held constituency, in this case North Norfolk.  This will be a hard fight: South Smallburgh has voted Lib Dem in the last two elections but is not safe.  The Lib Dems gained the division from the Conservatives in 2009 with a majority of 139 votes, but the Lib Dem councillor then defected to the Tories and stood for re-election in 2013 as a Conservative.  The 2013 result turned into a close three-way marginal, with the Lib Dems reversing the defection to win with just 31% of the vote, 45 vote ahead of the Tories (who had 29%) and 111 ahead of UKIP (27%).  The division is made up of three whole district council wards, which in May returned three Tories and one Lib Dem - a Tory gain of one seat from the Lib Dems.

In 2009 Watton was one of the safest Tory divisions in the country, the Tories winning 76-24 in a straight fight with Labour, so it was remarkable that UKIP could turn that around four years later.  UKIP's gain came with 34% of the vote, 146 votes ahead of the Tories (27%) and 239 ahead of independent candidate Keith Gilbert (24%), a district councillor for Watton ward.  Breckland got new ward boundaries in May which makes comparison a little difficult, but there was no change in the division's council representation: the unchanged Watton ward continued to elect Gilbert (who topped the poll) and two Tories, while the former Tory Templar ward was split between two new Tory wards.

Turning to the candidate lists, the big surprise is that there is no defending UKIP candidate in Watton.  Instead of running a candidate of their own UKIP have endorsed Keith Gilbert, who is again standing as an independent candidate.  Gilbert is up against Tory candidate Claire Bowes, one of his colleagues as district councillor for Watton.  Also standing are Joe Sisto for Labour and Timothy Birt for the Green Party.

In South Smallburgh the defending Lib Dem candidate is Allison Bradnock, a graphic designer from Neatishead.  Potter Heigham resident Paul Rice, the Lib Dem turned Tory county councillor from 2009 to 2013, stands again for the Conservatives.  UKIP's candidate is Barry Whitehouse, from Ludham, while Labour (David Spencer) and Green (Anne Filgate) candidates complete the ballot paper.

AYLESFORD GREEN, Ashford borough council, Kent; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Kate Hooker for family reasons.  She had represented the ward since May.

For the first of this week's English by-elections we are in Ashford, Kent, a late twentieth-century boom towm which has benefited from good road and rail links to London and the Continent, thanks to its Eurostar international station.  The Aylesford Green ward covers two distinct parts of south-eastern Ashford bisected by the High Speed 1 line, with only footpaths connecting them: to the east is Aylesford Green itself, an area of postwar London overspill housing named after a small area of open space next to the Old Mill Stream; while to the west lies the New Town area, originally built by the South Eastern Railway in the 1840s as its main locomotive works with adjacent housing for railway staff.  Railway use of the site ended here in the 1980s and the works are now the Old Railway Works Industrial Estate.

The history of the ward is reflected in a distinctly working-class population and high levels of social housing.  Despite that, the ward has a history of close results.  In 2003 it was won by the Ashford Independents, a well-organised localist group who beat Labour by 35 votes.  Labour didn't contest the 2007 election, in which the Ashford Independents lost their seat to the Lib Dems by just ten votes.  However, the Lib Dems didn't defend their seat in 2011 and Labour made the pickup, beating the Ashford Independents by a single vote.  May's election was relatlively sedate, Labour winning 55-45 in a straight fight with the Conservatives.  At county level this is part of the Ashford East division, which has been Lib Dem since 2005 but was a three-way marginal in 2013 with UKIP second and the Tories third.

Defending for Labour is Gordon Miller, a Unite member and Salvationist who stood in May's election in the neighbouring Norman ward and lost it to the Conservatives.  The Tories have gone for youth in selecting Alex Howard, chairman of the Ashford branch of Conservative Future.  Also on the ballot paper are a couple of familiar names.  The Lib Dems' Adrian Gee-Turner is a former Hackney councillor and was runner-up in the Mayor of Hackney election in 2010; the Ashford Independents' candidate Christine Kathawick-Smith is a retired nurse hoping to join her husband David on the council; the Green Party have selected Thom Pizzey, a parish councillor for the village of Stanhope which was been swallowed up by Ashford's expansion; last but not least UKIP are represented by Harriet Yeo, a former Labour borough councillor (for the neighbouring Norman ward) and NEC member who fought Folkestone and Hythe for UKIP in the general election.

EPSOM WEST, Surrey county council; caused by the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Stella Lallement, who has fallen out with her local party.  She had been a Surrey county councillor since 2013.

We're in Surrey commuter territory here, an area lying generally to the north-west of the Sutton-Epsom-Dorking railway line.  Although Epsom, a former spa town which gave its name to a magnesium sulphate compound, lies within the built-up area of London it has never been incorporated within the Greater London area.  The town's location on the North Downs together with its good railway service (five trains per hour to Victoria and four to Waterloo) makes it a very desirable place to live, and Epsom and Ewell council's Stamford ward - covering the west of the town - has all the demographic hallmarks of a middle-class London commuter area.  The Court ward to the north-west of the town centre, on the other hand, rather sticks out with high levels of social housing - and half of it is included within this county division.

Local election results in Epsom are very difficult to read for several reasons.  One is that the borough's county divisions were redrawn at the last election in 2013: Epsom West is based on the former Lib Dem division of Epsom and Ewell South West, but with half of Town ward transferred to Epsom and Ewell South East (which was renamed Epsom Town and Downs).  Another is that this is a stronghold of the Residents Assocations, who have controlled the local district council since it was created as a municipal borough in 1937.  The county division contains the whole of Stamford ward and half of Court and Town wards: Court, reflecting its demographics, is a Labour stronghold, while Stamford was Lib Dem from 2003 until May's elections, when it was lost to the Residents who also hold Town ward.  As stated, the only previous result on the current county division boundaries is from 2013, where the Lib Dems won with just 28% to 23% for the Residents, 20% for Labour and 16% for UKIP who pushed the Tories into fifth place.  Not often that happens in Surrey.

The Lib Dems are facing an uphill struggle to hold this one, having lost all their seats on the borough council in May.  Their candidate is former borough councillor Julie Morris.  The Residents' candidate is Neil Dallen, borough councillor for Town ward since 2007.  Labour's candidate is Kate Chinn, borough councillor for Court ward.  UKIP have selected Robert Leach, a former Residents figure who fought Epsom and Ewell in the general election.  Also standing are Karen Persand for the Tories and Chris Crook, who gives an address in Dorking, for the Green Party.

DEWI and LLANAELHAEARN, Gwynedd county council; caused respectively by the resignations of Plaid Cymru councillor Eddie Dogan and Llais Gwynedd councillor Llywarch Jones.  Dogan was Bangor's longest-serving local councillor, having first been elected to Bangor city council in 1972.  He had represented Dewi ward continuously since 1978, originally on the former Arfon district council.  Along the way he served twice as Mayor of Bangor, was made a Freeman of the city and was given a Bene Morente award signed by Pope John Paul II.  Originally a Labour councillor who defected to Plaid Cymru in 2005, he is retiring on health grounds.  Jones had served on Gwynedd council since 2012.

Starting with Llanaelhaearn, a small village in the north of the Lleyn peninsula.  This is a religious settlement associated with Saints Aelhaiarn and Beuno, and St Aelhaearn's well in the village was a stop on the traditional pilgrimage route to Bardsey Island; however, the presence of a Latin gravestone in the churchyard bearing the name of an Aliortus of Elmet, a pre-Anglo Saxon kingdom covering what is now the West Riding of Yorkshire, suggests that the site may have been significant before Beuno's time.

Dewi, on the other hand, is an urban ward of southern Bangor, covering the Coed Mawr area and extending along the Caernarfon Road as far as the A55 bypass.  This is generally where Bangor's out-of-town shopping is.  The main demographic feature of the ward is a large student population, reflecting that Bangor is a university city.

Eddie Dogan's successor has a lot to live up to.  Dogan had large majorities in his last three re-elections, finishing his electoral career in 2012 by beating the Labour candidate 57-35.  Plaid have nominated Gareth Roberts to replace him.  Confusingly, the Labour candidate is Eirian Roberts, chair of the Coed Mawr Glanadda community group.  Also standing is Andrew Joyce of the Lib Dems.

Llanaelhaearn has a more interesting electoral history.  Plaid were unopposed here in 2004, but in 2008 lost the seat to independent candidate Dafydd Roberts by six votes in a three-way marginal result.  In 2012 Roberts stood down and Llais Gwynedd, an anti-Plaid localist group, convincingly gained the seat by beating another independent candidate 50-34.  The defending Llais candidate is Wynne Thomas Issac, who is opposed by independent Eric Cullen and Plaid's Aled Wyn Jones.
