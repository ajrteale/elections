Six by-elections this week in an unusually busy August, with two each in England, Wales and Scotland.  One of the Welsh and both the Scottish polls are caused by newly-elected MPs resigning their council seats.

GLASBURY, Powys county council; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Christopher Davies, who is now the Member of Parliament for Brecon and Radnorshire.

"A wild rainy night. They are holding Clyro Feast Ball at the Swan opposite. As I write I hear the scraping and squealing of the fiddle and the ceaseless heavy tramp of the dancers as they stamp the floor in a country dance. An occasional blast of wind or rush of wind shakes my window. Toby sits before the fire on the hearthrug and now and then jumps up on my knee to be stroked. The mice scurry rattling along the wainscot and Toby darts off in great excitement to listen and watch for them."

That was the curate of the Radnorshire village of Clyro, the well-known diarist Francis Kilvert, being annoyed by festivities at the pub opposite his house during the early 1870s.  The Swan is now known as the Baskerville Arms, and your columnist can recommend it for a good night's stay in the Marches: a brisk 20-minute walk to the south-east will bring you over the River Wye to Hay-on-Wye, the second-hand booklover's Mecca and also the largest town for miles in any direction; while Clyro, just outside the Brecon Beacons National Park, is located in some spectacular walking country.

The Glasbury division covers a large area of a surprisingly remote part of the Marches.  The division is rather misnamed, in that while Glasbury-on-Wye is the largest centre of population this division only contains the Radnorshire half of the village; a rather better name would have been Painscastle, as despite having comfortably under 2,000 electors the division has the same boundaries as the former Painscastle rural district of Radnorshire, which was abolished in 1974.  Painscastle itself is a village in the north of the division built around a Norman castle which saw much action during the wars between the Normans and Welsh.  In modern times the division's population is relatively old, with high numbers of households living rent-free and almost 28% of the adult population being self-employed, one of the highest figures in England and Wales.

That self-employment figure reflects the division's remoteness from large towns.  Despite the area's historic location within Radnorshire, the main service centre for the area is Brecon while, just to confuse matters, Clyro gets its post from Hereford (over twenty miles away) and so has an English postcode.  Local election results in rural Wales tend to be just as confusing to the by-election pundit, as electorates are small, personalities matter and polls are often uncontested.  Such was the case here in 2004 and 2008 when Margaret Morris was elected as independent councillor for Glasbury without opposition.  She lost her seat in 2012 to the Tory candidate Christopher Davies by 51% to 30%.

Defending for the Conservatives is James Evans, who gives an address in the hamlet of Rhosgoch near Painscastle; he works for Davies as his communications officer.  The other three candidates all give addresses in Clyro.  Independent candidate David Hood JP, a Clyro community councillor and husband of the local postmistress, stands again after coming third here in 2012 with 18%.  Louise Davies, who runs a shop in Hay-on-Wye selling fairtrade items, stands for the Green Party.  

Completing the ballot paper is the division's first Liberal Democrat candidate this century, James Gibson-Watt.  Gibson-Watt is a former Mayor of Hay-on-Wye and until losing his seat in 2008 was county councillor for Hay.  His family connections deserve a paragraph of their own.  He is a nephew of the former Conservative MP David Gibson-Watt, who won the Hereford by-election in 1956 and served as MP for Hereford until October 1974, later entering the House of Lords as Lord Gibson-Watt; a sometime father-in-law to the future Labour Health Secretary Patricia Hewitt, David's parliamentary career included two spells as a junior minister (at the Treasury under Macmillan and in the Welsh Office under Heath), while before entering politics he had served with distinction in the Welsh Guards in North Africa and Italy, winning an MC and two bars.  James is also a grandson of the former Eton cricket captain, head of the World War Two Special Operations Executive, director of the Bank of England and Great Western Railway and chairman of Hambro's Bank Sir Charles Hambro.  Not only that, James Gibson-Watt comes from a family which once owned much of Radnorshire; his father Andrew Gibson-Watt, his grandfather James Miller Gibson-Watt and his great-grandfather James Watt Gibson-Watt all served as High Sheriffs of Radnorshire or (in Andrew's case) of Powys; while his great-great-great-grandfather is none other than James Watt himself.  An interesting pedigree to round off an interesting by-election.

CROSSKEYS, Caerphilly county borough council; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Michael Gray on health grounds.  First elected in 1985, Gray was the last mayor of the old Islwyn council and served as mayor of Caerphilly in 2013/4.

The village of Cross Keys is a classic Welsh valleys mining village, located about seven miles north-west of Newport at the confluence of the Rivers Ebbw and Sirhowy.  The village has recently been reconnected to the outside world with the reopening of Crosskeys railway station, with hourly trains to Ebbw Vale and Cardiff.  The division also includes the village of Pontywaun, the next village to the north along the Ebbw valley.

There's not much to see here in terms of previous results: Gray had thirty years continuous' service as councillor for the village and there is nothing to indicate that Labour won't hold the seat very easily.  At the most recent election in 2012 Labour had 55% here, with an independent candidate coming in second on 28%.

The defending Labour candidate is Julan Simmonds of Cross Keys, a governor at the local Waunfawr Primary School; he is opposed by the regular local Plaid candidate, Pontywaun resident Christopher Cook, and by the division's first UKIP candidate, Joe Smyth.

NUNEATON WHITESTONE, Warwickshire county council; caused by the resignation of Conservative councillor Martin Heatley on health grounds.  Heatley, who has since died at the age of 71, had been a Warwickshire county councillor since 1993 and was the council's cabinet member for the environment; until May he was vice-chairman of the county council.  At the time of his resignation he was also facing allegations of benefit fraud.

It was Nuneaton that provided the "Basildon moment" of the 2015 general election: as one of the first marginal seats to declare its result, it was when the Conservatives increased their majority in the seat that it became clear that Labour were not going to form a government, thus plunging the party into an interminable leadership election (is there really another month of this to go?).  Much of the Tory vote within Nuneaton will have come from Whitestone, an area of postwar housing at the town's south-eastern corner off the Lutterworth Road.  The figure which really sticks out from Whitestone ward's census statistics is the owner-occupied percentage, which at 94.3% is the eighth-highest figure for any ward in England and Wales: there are also relatively high proportions of people with apprenticeships, and Sikhs.  The White Stone of the name can be found at the junction of Lutterworth Road, Bulkington Lane and Golf Drive.

However, differing boundaries at ward and county level make the comparison rather difficult: Whitestone county division only includes part of Whitestone ward, with the other half of the division coming from Attleborough on the other side of the West Coast Main Line.  Attleborough is an older area and much more socially mixed.  

This difference is reflected in the local election results, although comparison is difficult as Nuneaton and Bedworth was one of the few English districts which did not hold local elections in May this year.  Whitestone ward is solidly Conservative, while Attleborough is a key marginal ward which Labour gained from the Tories at the most recent borough election in 2014.  This adds up to a safe Tory county division which Heatley won 53-31 at his last re-election in 2013.

Defending for the Tories is Jeff Morgan, a photographer and community activist who won a by-election to Nuneaton and Bedworth borough council from Arbury ward (in the south-west of the town) in December 2013, but lost his seat at the ordinary election five months later.  He should have an easier ride here.  Labour have reselected their 2013 candidate Andrew Crichton, a barman in his mid-twenties.  Also standing are Mick Ludford for the Green Party and Alwyn Waine for UKIP.

PINHOE, Exeter city council; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Simon Bowkett, who is concentrating on his role as chief executive of the charity Exeter Council for Voluntary Service.  He had served on Exeter city council since 2012, gaining his seat from the Conservatives.

Incorporated into Exeter in 1966, Pinhoe is the north-eastern corner of Exeter, hard up against the M5 motorway.  Pinhoe was the site of a battle in 1001 in which Danish forces, fresh from besieging Exeter, defeated a Saxon army; another legacy of war is that the local community centre, America Hall, was built using funds donated by the families of US service personnel stationed here during the Second World War.  Pinhoe's railway station reopened in 1983, with hourly or two-hourly trains to Exeter St Davids and London Waterloo.  The main curiosity from the ward's census figures is a very high proportion of part-time workers.

At local level this is a hard-fought marginal where majorities are often tiny: Labour by 55 votes in 2004, Conservative gain by 83 votes in 2008, Labour gain by 4 votes in September 2010, Labour hold by 34 votes at the most recent election here in 2014, in which Labour had 37%, the Tories 35% and UKIP were a strong third with 19%; that 2014 poll was also notable for seeing one of the few local election candidates from the UKIP splinter group An Independence from Europe, who didn't quite manage 1% here.  Labour have less trouble at county level in which Pinhoe is paired with the safe Mincinglake city ward.

Defending for Labour is David Harvey.  The Conservatives have selected Cynthia Thompson, who was a councillor for this ward between 2008 and 2012, losing her seat to Bowkett, and has been trying to get back ever since.  Alison Sheridan, who fought St Loyes ward in the 2015 city elections, stands for UKIP.  Also on the ballot paper are Michael Payne for the Lib Dems, John Moreman for the Green Party and independent candidate David Smith.

DENNY AND BANKNOCK, Falkirk council; caused by the resignation of SNP councillor John McNally, who is now the Member of Parliament for Falkirk.  McNally had served on Falkirk council since 2007.

Another two SNP councillors have caused by-elections following their election to Westminster in the SNP surge.  We start in Stirlingshire in the town of Denny, next to the M80 and M876 motorways around seven miles west of Falkirk.  The ward includes several villages in Denny's hinterland such as Dunipace to the north and Banknock, on the Falkirk-Kilsyth road and the Forth and Clyde canal, to the south.  This was an area of heavy engineering, with Denny itself specialising in ironworking and some coalmining in the area.

The SNP did well here in 2007 to come top of the poll, having won none of the four predecessor wards (Banknock, Denny, Denny South and Herbertshire) in 2003 and having run the council from 2003 to 2007 in a coalition with independents.  In a complete clearout of the previous representation, the SNP won two seats that year, with Labour winning one and the final seat going to independent candidate Alex Waddell.  Waddell lost his seat in the 2012 election, but his transfers elected another independent candidate, Brian McCabe, who easily defeated the second Labour candidate to win the final seat.  The first preferences here in 2012 were 39% to the SNP, 31% to Labour and 12% to McCabe.  There are no implications for control of Falkirk council which is run by a Labour-led anti-SNP coalition.

In a four-cornered race the defending SNP candidate is John Garner, a radio engineer from Denny who joined the party during the independence referendum campaign.  Labour have selected Andrew Bell, from Larbert.  Also on the ballot paper are David Grant for the Conservatives and Brian Capaloff for the Green Party.

WISHAW, North Lanarkshire council; caused by the resignation of SNP councillor Marion Fellows, who is now the Member of Parliament for Motherwell and Wishaw.  Fellows had served on North Lanarkshire council since 2012.

Overshadowed by its neighbour Motherwell, Wishaw is a Victorian-era town which was incorporated as a burgh in 1855.  It was traditionally a steelworking and coalmining town thanks to its proximity to the former Ravenscraig steelworks, but today services and distribution (Royal Mail's main distribution centre for Scotland is here) are the major employers.  At the centre of town is Wishaw's railway station, located on the Argyle Line with half-hourly trains to Motherwell, Lanark, Glasgow Central and beyond.

The town's industrial legacy added up to a strong Labour vote in those long-gone days before the independence referendum.  Labour easily held all the predecessor wards under first-past-the-post, and comfortably won three of the ward's four seats at the 2007 election, the SNP winning the other.  In the 2012 election the SNP went for two seats, and got them thanks to Labour failing to balance their three candidates.  First preferences in 2012 were 58% to Labour and 34% to the SNP, so the SNP would need a swing of 12% to lead on first preferences and 16% to win in the first round.  Eminently achievable in the current political climate.  There are no implications for control of North Lanarkshire council where Labour have a strong majority.

Defending for SNP is Rosa Zambonini, a single mum from Wishaw who briefly worked as a TV reporter.  Labour's candidate is Peter McDade.  Also standing are the ward's regular Tory candidate Marjory Borthwick, Maria Feeney from the Scottish Socialist Pary, Gerard Neary of the Lib Dems and UKIP's Neil Wilson.
