CLIFTON-WITH-MAIDENWAY, Torbay council, Devon; caused by the death of Liberal Democrat councillor Ruth Pentney at the age of 62, from motor neurone disease.  A Torbay councillor since 2003, Pentney was the election agent for the former Torbay MP Adrian Sanders in his four general election wins from 1997 to 2010, and had held pretty much every available post in the local party.

This ward is an entirely built-up section of Paignton, the middle of the three towns on the shore of Tor Bay.  Cliton-with-Maidenway ward is the landward side of town, a residential ward running from Primley Park at the southern end to Maidenway Road at the northern end.  This is generally a poor area with large levels of part-time working; not unusual demographics for a seaside resort.  

The Tory vote has grown here, and from 2003 to 2011 this ward developed from a Lib Dem bastion into a Lib Dem-leaning marginal: in 2011 the Lib Dem slate beat the Tories 37-32, with Labour fighting the ward for the first time and polling 18%, and the two Lib Dem councillors holding majorities of 119 and 59 votes.  In that context the Lib Dems did extremely well to hold on to the ward in May's ordinary election with majorities of 54 and 46; in shares of the vote the Lib Dems had 30%, the Conservatives 29%, UKIP 20% and Labour 12%.

So, a key marginal by-election which might be an indicator of whether the Lib Dems have any strength left in the south-west following the loss of all their MPs from the region in May.  The Lib Dems have served an indicator that they going all-out to hold this seat by selecting Adrian Sanders, the MP for Torbay from 1997 to May this year and a former Torbay councillor (from 1984 to '86).  The Tories' Richard Barnby tries again after his near-miss in May; he greatly outpolled his running-mate in that election and clearly has a large personal vote.  UKIP's candidate is Anthony Rayner, while Labour have selected Eddie Harris; the Greens' Stephen Pocock completes the ballot paper.

HUNTLY, STRATHBOGIE AND HOWE OF ALFORD, Aberdeenshire council; a double by-election caused by the death of SNP councillor Joanna Strathdee and the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor Alastair Ross.  Strathdee, who has died of cancer at the age of 60, was first elected to Aberdeenshire council in 1999 and led the SNP group from 2007 to 2010; she also fought Gordon in the 2005 Westmineter election and Aberdeen North in 2010.  Outside of politics, Strathdee was a former bus driver with a passion for motorcycling and Highland dancing - becoming a Highland dancing teacher while she was in her 20s.  Ross, whose resignation came for health reasons, had been an Aberdeenshire councillor since 2007.

We have here a large rural ward in the interior of Aberdeenshire.  The largest town is Huntly, on the main road and railway line from Aberdeen to Inverness; named after the Earls of Huntly, the chief of the Clan Gordon, the town is home to the ruined Huntly Castle, the Earls' ancestral home until the time of the Civil War.  In later times Huntly was the home of the former Gordon Highlanders regiment, while its main industries now are tourism and shortbread.  

Huntly is the centre of the wider Strathbogie district, named after the River Bogie, while to the south lies the Howe of Alford, based on the small but surprisingly busy village of Alford (the L is silent).  Alford claims to be the home of the Aberdeen Angus breed of cattle, while the Grampian Transport Museum attracts tourists; the village is growing strongly as a commuter area for Aberdeen, thirty miles away, thanks to the strength of the oil industry.

The Tories had the most to lose here from the introduction of PR in 2007, as they had won two of the predecessor wards in 2003 (Huntly East and Strathbogie), while Huntly West was SNP (it was Joanna Strathdee's seat) and Alford voted Lib Dem.  However, the Lib Dems were the strongest party across the area in terms of votes and they were the only party to try for two seats in 2007: a decision which the SNP must have regretted after topping the poll but only having one candidate.  In the 2012 election the Lib Dems gave up one of their seats without a fight, while the SNP tried for two: on first preferences the SNP consolidated their lead on 35%, the Tories polling 26%, the Lib Dems 18% and independent candidate John Latham getting 14%, but it was Latham - thanks to strong transfers from the Greens and Tories - who picked up the second Lib Dem seat by finishing 77 votes ahead of the second SNP candidate.

This is Scotland's second double by-election under the Single Transferable Vote (the first one was in Edinburgh in September), and to win one of the two available seats candidates will need to get one-third of the vote, either on first preferences or by attracting transfers.  That shouldn't be a problem for the defending SNP candidate Gwyneth Petrie, office manager for the local MSP Dennis Robertson.  The defending Lib Dem candidate Daniel Millican, a solicitor from Alford, has a tougher task starting from third place in the first preference vote: in order to win he will need to overtake the Tory candidate Margo Stewart, a farmer's wife and retired teacher.  Also standing are Sarah Flavell for Labour and Derek Scott for the Libertarian Party.
