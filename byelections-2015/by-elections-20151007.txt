AN TAOBH SIAR AGUS NIS, Comhairle nan Eilean Siar; caused by the death of Independent councillor Iain Morrison at the age of 60.  "Iain a' Mhillichan", as he was better known on Lewis, was one of the longest serving Western Isles councillors, having been first elected in 1999 for the former Barvas and Arnol ward.  Morrison was a director of and driver for the family bus company.  A keen footballer who once played in goal for Stornoway United against Celtic, Morrison served for eight years as chairman of the Western Isles Island Games association, standing down after the 2013 Island Games in Bermuda at which the Western Isles team won ten medals, four of them gold.

For the first of this week's two Scottish by-elections we travel to the Isle of Lewis.  An Taobh Siar agus Nis can be loosely translated into English as "West Side and Ness", and consists of a series of villages along Lewis' north-west coast, from Shawbost at the western end to the Port of Ness at the eastern end.  This is a little-known and less-visited area, and a stronghold of the Gaelic language: this is the ward with the highest proportion of Gaelic speakers in Scotland, and has the distinction of being the most northwesterly electoral district in the European Union.  Included within the ward is the remote island of Sula Sgeir, a dot in the north Atlantic forty miles to the north of Lewis inhabited only by gannets: these are a local delicacy on Ness, with the supply coming from a controversial licensed hunt each autumn.

The Outer Hebrides' local politics are dominated by independents, although not to the same extent as in the non-partisan Orkney or Shetland: in the 2012 election official party candidates took ten of the islands' 31 seats.  One of those was an SNP gain in West Side and Ness, coming from an independent councillor who had stood down.  The other three independent councillors were all re-elected very easily, Iain Morrison coming top of the poll; between them the five independent candidates had 80% and the SNP 20%.  One of the other independent councillors, Kenneth Murray, died earlier this year and was replaced by Alistair Maclennan, who had been a distant runner-up in the 2012 election; however, that by-election wasn't covered in this column because it was uncontested - the first uncontested local election in Scotland since the introduction of PR in 2007.

Two independent candidates are standing to succeed Morrison.  John Norman Macleod is prominent in the local community and was prominent in Lewis' Yes campaign during last year's referendum, while Richard Froggatt is a carer who migrated here from England nine years ago.  Completing the ballot paper is the ward's only official party candidate, TV editor Gavin Humphreys of the Scottish Green Party.

RIVERSIDE, Cardiff city council; caused by the resignation of Labour councillor Cecilia Love.  Love, whose resignation came for a combination of family reasons and poor attendance at council meetings, had served as a councillor since 2012.

There's a lot of rugby on at the moment, and Wales have been doing very well in the present World Cup.  They do have the advantage (like, er, England) of playing some of their games in their home venue, the large Millennium Stadium on the banks of the River Taff.  The Riverside division is the other side of the river from the Millennium Stadium, with much of the actual riverside forming the park of Sophia Gardens, home to Glamorgan cricket club's Test ground, the SSE SWALEC Stadium.  This is an interesting mix of areas.  At the northern end is Pontcanna, a leafy area favoured by the Welsh arts and media establishment (the so-called "crachach") which once hosted TV studios for HTV and S4C.  At the southern end is Riverside proper, an ethnic enclave with large Bangladeshi and Chinese populations - Love herself was a single mum from a Far Eastern background.

The England cricket team played a Test match at Sophia Gardens here in July, in which Joe Root was the star of an unexpectedly one-sided first Ashes test.  Like England cricket, this column seems to be returning to Riverside division on a very frequent basis, for the councillor attrition rate is high: this is the division's third by-election in five years.  This division is a Labour versus Plaid battle: the three seats split 2-1 in Plaid's favour in 2004 and Plaid gained the Labour seat in 2008, but since then the tide has turned: the March 2011 by-election was a big win for Labour, and they followed up by easily gaining the two remaining Plaid seats in 2012.  The most recent by-election, held in December 2013, saw Labour win with 50% and Plaid second on 35%, almost no swing since 2012.  To add to the division's interesting features, the number of votes was unusually low in 2008 and there was speculation at the time that the counting team might have missed a ballot box.  Even more interest can be added by noting that the ruling Labour group on Cardiff city council is in a state of civil war, and the council leader won re-election this year by just one vote - Love's vote.  There could be some interesting consequences from this by-election.

Defending for Labour is Caro Wild, a former rugby league coach who is now a campaigner on cycling and discrimination.  His main opposition will come from Ruksana Begum of Plaid, who are on a bit of a high in Cardiff after nearly winning the most recent city by-election in an even more crachach division than this one; however, that was in a commuter village, the opponent was the Tories and the Plaid candidate there had some name recognition as Dafydd Wigley's son.  Also on the ballot are Sean Driscoll for the Tories, Gareth Bennett for UKIP, Steffan Bateman for the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition, former Only Connect contestant Gwilym Owen for the Liberal Democrats and Hannah Pudner of the Green Party.
