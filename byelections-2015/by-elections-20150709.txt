Eight by-elections on 9th July 2015:

OLD HASTINGS AND TRESSELL, East Sussex county council; and CENTRAL ST LEONARDS and ST HELENS, Hastings borough council.  The first two by-elections are both due to the death of Labour county and borough councillor Jeremy Birch, who was leader of Hastings council.  The St Helens by-election is due to the resignation of Conservative councillor Matthew Lock, who until December was leader of the Conservative group, ostensibly for ill-health and personal reasons, although he has since been arrested on suspicion of grooming a 15-year-old boy.
