One by-election on Tuesday 18th August 2015:

WEST MAINLAND, Orkney Islands council; caused by the death of councillor Alistair Gordon.  A former journalist at the local newspaper The Orcadian and teacher at Kirkwall grammar school, Gordon was first elected to Orkney council in 2003 and was convener of the council's Orkney Manifesto group, which is seeking to improve the islands' governance.

The West Mainland ward is pretty much what it says, a large and mostly empty area of the Orkney Mainland to the north and north-east of Stromness.  This is a land of small agricultural villages, including Orkney's biggest parish (Sandwick, on the west coast), inland Stenness at the southern end of its namesake loch, and Evie and Rendall on the north coast.  West Mainland ward has been inhabited for centuries, as evidenced by the Neolithic archeological sites of Skara Brae, Maes Howe, the standing stones of Stenness and the Ring of Brodgar, all of which are within this ward and since 1999 have formed a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  While these doubtless attract some intrepid tourists, another draw is the wonderfully-named village of Twatt, in the north of the ward.

Alistair Gordon was first elected in 2003 for the former Firth and Sunnybrae ward, rather narrowly defeating Eoin Scott who later join him on the council at the 2007 election for the new West Mainland ward.  Gordon was the only councillor to be re-elected in 2012, polling 17.5% of the first preferences to finish second out of nine candidates.  

Orkney's elections are traditionally non-partisan, and so I have not given previous election results below, but party politics appears to have broken out with a vengeance with this by-election.  Defending for the Orkney Manifesto Group is Rachael King, an art psychotherapist from Sandwick.  In Orkney's first all-female election, Birsay resident Barbara Foulkes stands as an independent, while Sandwick resident Fiona Grahame, who has turned her love of knitting into a business, stands for the Scottish Green Party.

Three by-elections on Thursday 20th August 2015:

CAMBORNE PENDARVES, Cornwall council; caused by the resignation of UKIP councillor Harry Blakeley on health grounds.  First elected to Cornwall council in 2013, he was formerly an area manager for a national brewery, and among his work with local organisations is a trustee of St Michael's hospital in Hayle.

This division is southern Camborne, running south from the town centre and railway station.  It also includes the villages of Penponds and Barripper to the south-west of Camborne.  The division is named after the Pendarves family, a major family of local land and mineowners since the sixteenth century; a fitting name for a ward which is pockmarked by old mineshafts.  However, the ward's most famous son is the engineer Richard Trevithick, who was born in Penponds in 1771 and developed the world's first steam locomotive in Camborne.

The present Camborne Pendarves division dates only from 2013 when Cornwall was redistricted.  In that election UKIP won with a rather low vote share of 32%, twenty-one votes ahead of the Conservatives who had 30%; there were also decent vote shares for the Cornish nationalist party Mebyon Kernow (20%) and Labour (19%).  Since then UKIP's fortunes have been on the slide in Camborne; their other Cornwall councillor for the town resigned earlier this year and the by-election (held on general election day) was lost to Labour.  At the 2009 election this area was split between the Troon and Beacon division, which voted Conservative, and Camborne South which was one of three Cornish divisions carried by Mebyon Kernow; while the predecessor wards and divisions before the unitary Cornwall council was created in 2009 tended to be carried by the Lib Dems but could return councillors from pretty much any party.

Defending for UKIP is Michael Pascoe, straight back on the campaign trail after finishing second here in May in a by-election to Camborne town council.  The Tories, who won that by-election comfortably, have selected John Herd, who fought the predecessor Camborne South division in 2009 and lost to Mebyon Kernow by just twenty votes.  Deborah Fox is the Mebyon Kernow candidate and Val Dalley stands for Labour.  Also on the ballot paper are Lib Dem Nathan Billings, independent Peter Channon and the Greens' Jacqueline Merrick.

SHOTTON AND SOUTH HETTON, Durham council; caused by the death of Labour councillor Robin Todd at the age of 74.  An electrician who started work at 17 as an apprentice at South Hetton pit, Todd served continuously as a councillor for 51 years, first being elected at the age of 23 to the long-abolished Easington Rural District Council.  Once election agent to the local MP Manny Shinwell, and chairman of Easington district council in 1976-77, his legacy will be the Robin Todd Centre, a community centre in South Hetton opened in 2002 and named in his honour.  Todd was appointed MBE in 2006 for services to local government, was a founder member of the unitary Durham council in 2009, and just a week before his death was elected as vice-chairman of Durham council.

This is a classic ex-coalmining division based on pit villages.  Shotton Colliery, at the south end of the ward, is just off the A19 road west of Peterlee and was based on a large colliery which was first developed in 1840 and closed in 1972.  South Hetton, to the north-west on the Houghton-Easington road, was based around a colliery which operated continuously from 1831 to 1982, but is probably better known for the so-called "one-armed bandit murder" of Angus Sibbet in 1967, one of the North East's most notorious criminal cases.  In between is Haswell, the birthplace of the ill-fated British cyclist Tommy Simpson.

This is the former Easington district of Durham, one of the strongest Labour areas in the country: Todd's last two re-elections to the former Easington district council, from the Easington Village and South Hetton ward, were unopposed.  In 2013, the only previous result on the present division boundaries, the Labour slate had 43% of the vote, with an independent polling 33% and a "FAIR and Independent" candidate (one of several in the Peterlee area) coming last with 24%.

Defending for Labour is Alan Liversidge, the chairman of Haswell parish council and a local historian.  He is opposed by, in ballot paper order, Michael Anderson for the Lib Dems; Beaty Bainbridge, a former Durham councillor from Chester-le-Street who appears to be the go-to Tory candidate for Durham by-elections at the moment; Ted Hall, from Shotton Colliery, for the North East Party; Lee-James Harris, who gives an address in Bishop Auckland, for UKIP; and Peterlee resident Martie Warin for the Green Party.

WITNEY NORTH, West Oxfordshire district council; caused by the resignation of independent councillor David Snow.  Snow was first elected in 2012, as a Conservative candidate, but then left the party over the issue of gay marriage; his resignation from the council came due to work commitments.

This is, obviously, the northern end of the town of Witney, along the Crawley, Hailey and New Yatt roads.  Witney is the major town of West Oxfordshire district and is based around a crossing-point of the River Windrush: it has lost its traditional blanket industry, but is still known as the home of the Wychwood Brewery, whose flagship drink Hobgoblin is brewed here.  Witney is part of the constituency of the Prime Minister David Cameron, who presented Barack Obama with twelve bottles of Hobgoblin during a G20 summit in Toronto in 2010.  West Oxfordshire district council's offices are located within the ward and form one of the two polling stations.

The presence of Witney within the PM's constituency is a boost for the Tory vote here, although this ward was narrowly won by the Lib Dems in 2003 before their vote faded away.  The main peculiarity of the ward is the strength of the local Green Party, who normally finish second here, although they lost second spot to Labour at the most recent local elections in May.  In May's poll the Tories won with 50%, well ahead of Labour on 19% and the Greens on 14%.

The Tories want their seat back, and have selected Carol Reynolds who represents this ward on Witney town council.  Back on the campaign trail for Labour, having stood in May's ordinary election, is Oxford Tube coach driver Trevor License.  The Green Party have reselected Brigitte Hickman, a teacher and bicycle enthusiast.  Also standing are UKIP's James Robertshaw, who is nominated by the outgoing councillor David Snow, and Diane West for the Lib Dems.
